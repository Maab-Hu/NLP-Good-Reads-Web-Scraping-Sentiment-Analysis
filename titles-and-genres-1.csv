0,City Under Siege,Romance,"London is a city in flames. Tensions are high and a critical situation is about to go from bad to worse. The Prime Minister wants to send a message, and the SAS will be the ones to deliver it.Emotional detachment is my speciality. I’m ruthless and cut throat, but there is nobody better.Sarah Tatem is an innocent. Caught up in a world in which she doesn’t belong, and trying desperately to do the right thing. My job is to keep her safe long enough to get what’s needed, and bring an end to this siege of terror.But something has changed. I’ve learned that the only thing stronger than loyalty is love, and now she’s gone.My name is Lieutenant Tom Harper, and I’m about to unleash hell.","5 ‘I was fucking Wonder Woman’ starsGah! My reading jewel of this month!Incredibly well written.Amazing heroine. Strong hero.A perfect mix of action, suspense and romance. Maybe a bit too much romance for the similar story in the real life, but we’re in fiction, so let them make love! *lol*Sarah. Such an interesting and strong heroine. Strong, but tender. Feminine, but sassy. She had her ‘moments’, but the girl had balls! 
""You need to stop judging people’s strength by their size. When the storm comes, sometimes the fragile flower will still be standing, long after the sturdy tree has fallen.""
It’s always my pleasure to read about smart women. But give me a smart woman with a backbone and I’ll read your grocery list!
""But what you call different, I call unique. I don’t mind being different.""
I won’t spoil the story *see, I can also write spoil-free reviews*. Sarah’s character could be described with this one line: 
""…as long as I could stand back up, I could fight.""
You know the typical romance ‘alpha’? You won’t find this a§§hole here, instead we have a real strong and honorable Man. No man is perfect and this one wasn’t either, but he was a good one. Stoic soldier, a good son of his country, a strong man. 
""Albert Einstein once said that the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.""
For my readers, who like possessive heroes – ladies, he is your man (but without OTT childish cavemanish tantrums – or, well, yeah, he was still sexy jealous).
""I don’t deserve you,"" he told me. ""I have more blood on my hands than you’ll ever know. I’m not good at the romance stuff or talking about how I feel. Shit, there’s going to be times you’ll scream at me in frustration because I don’t know how to do shit like normal people. But I’m never letting you go, buttercup. And until the day comes when they put me in a box in the ground, I’m yours.""
Loved how he loved her!
""My beautiful splash of colour in a sea of grey.""
The action was on a heavy side, but it made the story real. Some dark moments, mention of violence. Not everything was plausible, maybe some small plot holes. But overall highly enjoyable read!I really hope the fiction of this story would never become a reality.Safe! She wasn’t a virgin. He wasn’t a virgin either *lmao*, only little information about his sexual past (meaningless sex, no sleepovers and yada yada), but I wouldn’t call him a manwhore. No OW drama.I have so many amazing friends on GR and unfortunately we’ll very probably never meet in real life *sad*, but with this story you had an opportunity to meet my ‘doppelgänger’ - aka me in 30 years.Nan. My STAR of this book. F*ck my life, woman, you cheeky bitch!
""Wine is for when you’re eating out silly girl. In this house, we drink spirits. Now I’ve got vodka or gin?"" She (Nan) held up a rather hefty bottle of each.""Bit of both?""""Darling, welcome to the family,"" she replied.
She was actually very sweet and kind person. It was me making pranks ;-) or not
""Young man, I realise that a body like that isn’t a gift from God. I imagine you’ve worked very hard to look like something most women would like to climb. So you can imagine how much regret and remorse I’ll be filled with when I’m forced to rip off your nipples and feed them to you, which is exactly what I’ll do if you don’t move that fine arse and get out of my way!""",5.0

3,Wolf Trouble,Paranormal,"..There's never been a female on the Dallas SWAT team and Senior Corporal Xander Riggs prefers it that way. The elite pack of alpha male wolfshifters is no place for a woman. But Khaki Blake is no ordinary woman.When Khaki walks through the door attractive as hell and smelling like heaven, Xander doesn't know what the heck to do. Worse, she's put under his command and Xander's protective instincts go on high alert. When things start heating up both on and off the clock, it's almost impossible to keep their heads in the game and their hands off each other...","Reviewed by: Rabid Reads.Men in uniform is already a winning combination for the majority of romance readers, but then Paige Tyler went ahead, and sweetened the deal by casting sixteen alpha werewolves as this series’ heroes. WOLF TROUBLE was an improvement on the first book thanks to its less foreseeable plot twists, stronger amorous components, and because the shifter aspects were explored in greater detail. I thoroughly enjoyed my second SWAT experience, and will, without fail, be back for thirds!My two main criticisms of HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF were with regards to its lack of insight into the author’s wolves, and the overall cheesiness of the love story. Both of those issues were addressed in this installment, and as a result, I now have no problem committing to this series for the long haul. Tyler didn’t disclose all of her furry secrets, but she did provide an answer to my query about female werewolves, and explored it at length, so on that front I was completely satisfied.This novel’s plot was more along the lines of what I’ve come to expect from the Romantic Suspense genre as a whole with its multiple threads—none of which were overly predictable—and a generous helping of action to help offset the steamier bits. The author excelled at weaving in the various law agencies’ procedures by tackling things like inter-department collaboration, and bringing all of their specialized training to the fore. This book lived and breathed SWAT.Khaki and Xander’s relationship was a huge step in the right direction compared to the previous couples'; there were no eye rolling moments, and its progression felt more natural due to the female protagonist already being a cop… among other things. Yes, there were still a couple of things that were lost in translation, but it was normal men are from Mars, and women are from Venus stuff. The boss / subordinate dynamics also made the stakes more interesting to say the least.WOLF TROUBLE was a sexy game of tug-a-war between two alphas, and a must read. ~4.5 Stars",5.0
5,Witness to Passion,Romantic Suspense,"Under his protection and in his bed…For Fallon Wayland, birthdays are just another reminder of her looming spinsterhood. This year is shaping up to be no different. Unfairly fired from her job, dumped by her boyfriend, and oh yes, witnessing the murder of a high-ranking lieutenant in the local crime family… Yeah, birthdays suck.Ever since a disastrous, hot-as-hell kiss years ago, soldier-turned-security specialist Shane Roarke has avoided his baby sister’s reckless—and gorgeous—best friend. Yet when her life is threatened after she witnesses a gang hit, he insists on protecting her…even if she objects. The two are forced to hole up in a safe house. Alone. Passion long denied erupts between them, burning away their inhibitions. But even as layers—and clothes—are peeled away, danger closes in. Shane and Fallon might finally have a chance at love…if they survive long enough to see it.","3.5 Stars!!Fallon is a twenty-five years old girl who grew all her life without love and attention from her family. She saw what marriage did to her parents, so she’s not looking to tie the knot anytime soon or to be involved in a serious relationship. She may consider a no strings attached relationship with someone, but the thing is her lust interest doesn’t seem to notice her, or more exactly he doesn’t seem to see her like a woman. The reason? He is the big brother of her best friend. Shane Roarke is a former soldier turned security specialist, co-owner GDG Security Solutions. Shane knows Fallon for more than ten years. He saw her blossom in a lovely girl and later in a beautiful woman. He’s attracted to her, more than he wants to be and this is a bad, bad thing because he knows she’s off limits. For seven years since the ‘kiss incident’ he avoided his baby sister’s best friend like the plague, but when Fallon is in danger he’s ready to forget about their past and do anything to protect her. 

“She kissed like a sinner, not a saint. A sinner who enjoyed it. Just one crush of lips and tangle of tongues seven years ago, and he still remembered her taste. Sunshine and sex.”

Fallon still remembers that night when she embarrassed herself kissing Shane Roarke. She can admit to herself she still has a huge crush for this man who still insists she’s only like a sister to him. The two of them are forced by certain circumstances to hole up in a safe house. Alone. For an indefinite period of time. With too much free time. Well, well,...what can they do to fill their free time...especially when their chemistry is so sizzling. 

“Need was a living animal writhing inside her as she gripped his cock directly above his fist. Hot. Steel. Velvet. She tightened her hold, and it bucked and pulsed in her hand. This close his fresh wind scent was sharper, distilled, and combined with the unique musk that belonged solely to him, it made her mouth water for a taste. A taste…hell. She wanted to gorge herself on him.”

This read surprised me in a very good way. It had a little bit of everything, it was entertaining from start to finish and the writing was really engaging. While the suspense was low, the steam here was pretty high and I was more than fine with that. Both Fallon and Shane were likeable characters and their characterization was well done. Fallon is a girl who knows who she is and especially what she wants. She’s determined and funny and I just loved her sassiness. Shane was not as alpha as I expected, but I have to say he was just as good as one. He’s sexy, caring, considerate and protective. What annoyed me a little was the fact at times he acted like a high school kid...he thought too much..Anyway...I enjoyed their interactions, their sweet banter and of course the smexy sex scenes between them, which were hot as hell.  Overall, a great read!",4.0

7,Broken,Romantic Suspense,"Ex-SEAL and LOST founder Gabe Spencer is accustomed to the unusual in his job. But when knockout Eve Gray steps into his office, he's rattled. For the mysterious woman is a dead ringer for the heiress thought to be the latest prey of the serial killer who goes by the name Lady Killer.When Eve awoke in an Atlanta hospital, her past was a blank slate. Then she recognized her own face in the newspaper and vowed to learn the truth. Determined to confront the nightmares hidden in her mind, she never expects to find a partner in Gabe.As Gabe and Eve work together, their explosive attraction becomes irresistible. Gabe knows that his desire for Eve is growing too strong, bordering on a dangerous obsession, but nothing pulls him away from her. And when another Eve lookalike disappears, Gabe vows to protect Eve at all costs. While Eve may have forgotten the killer in her past, it's clear he hasn't forgotten her.","I actually don’t read romantic suspense very often anymore.  I used to read it slavishly but then I found I was galloping  through the story to get to the end expecting to see the Bad Guy come after the heroine and our hero ride in like a white knight and rescue her and I was skimming over the story and kind of missing the romance so I only dip my toes back in the suspense pool occasionally and when I do, I want it to be a good one.I’ve read Cynthia Eden’s Deadly series in the past and I know, as a romantic suspense, author she gives me what I’m looking for – seriously nasty and sadistic bad buys, a hot sexy romance and a highly suspenseful story and that’s what I was looking for in Broken and I definitely found it.Broken gives us not only a hot romance and a suspenseful story but also works hard at setting the scene for the rest of the LOST series, introducing us to the main characters who will no doubt star in future books and giving us a little bit of their background.  It seems all these people have something very dark in their past which has driven them to be part of Gabe Spencer’s new missing persons agency and there’s just enough here to whet your appetite to want to carry on with the series.So we have Gabe Spencer, head honcho of the LOST organisation, and Eve Gray who has survived torture and near death to wake up with no memory of what happened that day or anything before.  The only thing she knows is that she’s escaped a killer and she looks uncannily like a missing heiress, suspected to be one of the killer’s victims.  She turns to Gabe and his organisation for help and they share an incredible attraction and, once he realises that the killer is coming for again, Gabe’s protective and possessive traits come rising to the surface and he vows to keep the woman he’s falling in love with safe from the clutches of her would-be murderer.This is a highly complex, multi-layered suspenseful story with plenty of red herrings and potential suspects. Pay close attention to all the details as there is plenty of little clues out there – some to definitely throw you off the scent but some do point straight at the killer.  When he’s eventually unmasked, he was one of my suspects but I had several so I don’t think it was at all predictable.  The plot is intriguing enough to keep me reading and gathering pace as I found myself dying to find out who the killer is and I once again found myself reading just a little too fast.  I tried to slow myself down, to appreciate the growing feelings between Gabe and Eve but I found it nigh on impossible!  Suspense novels just do this to me – I just have to know!I think the mystery pretty much takes centre stage here but it’s interwoven pretty well with the romance between the two central characters and, for the most part, I really did feel their overwhelming passion and desperation at the gathering danger for Eve.  It was very well done with some truly emotional and very hot sex scenes.  I very much enjoyed it, devoured it in fact.  The Killer truly was a fucked up, sadistic bastard and I think Cynthia Eden does this type of bad guy really well.  I very much liked Gabe and his crew who will no doubt entertain us for several books to come and I look forward to reading them.  If I have any complaints, it’s that I didn’t always completely get Gabe and Eve’s connection – it seemed to come out of nowhere, a kind of insta-love but I did eventually get on board with it and start rooting for them.  A good start to what promises to be a great series.

8,Beg for Mercy,Romantic Suspense,"He lurks in the shadows, waiting and watching . . . And once he has you, all you can do is. . .Beg For MercyMegan Flynn thought she was falling in love. Cole Williams wasn't just handsome and passionate, he was one of the good guys. Or so she thought, until he arrested her brother-the only family she has left-for a murder she knows he couldn't have possibly committed. Now, with her heart broken and her brother's life hanging in the balance, Megan will risk everything to prove his innocence. Even if that means throwing herself into the path of a killer with a hauntingly familiar MO.Seattle Detective Cole Williams had given up on making Megan see reason where her brother is concerned. But when she insinuates herself into the most shockingly brutal case Cole has ever worked, he can't stand idly by. Plunged into a secret world where the city's elite indulge their darkest desires, Cole will do whatever it takes to bring down a madman who has made Megan his most coveted prey.","Wow, what a book! I'm not even going to attempt much of a review, since my head is still spinning and I'm all jumpy with too much adrenaline! The suspense in this book was just awesome--Jami Alden, you hit this one out of the park! From page one I could not put it down. Everything worked in this book, and it pushed all my buttons and hit all my switches--a perfect romantic suspense.This isn't a lightweight RS at all--it's gritty, often graphically violent, deals with prostitution, rape, and human trafficking, and will leave you anxious as our heroine tries to save her brother who's been sentenced to die by lethal injection in just over a week. She's convinced her war hero brother didn't commit the rape and murder that he's been convicted of, and she doggedly pursues every lead she can follow to clear her brother's name.I had to admire her faith in her brother's innocence and her determination to get him exonerated, even when the facts all pointed to him being guilty. She put her own life on hold for 3 years, and was the only one who believed in him. Her blossoming romance with the tough cop who ended up arresting her brother was destroyed, yet that didn't stop her. She was going to prove her beloved brother's innocence or die trying (which nearly happened)!I love how Jami Alden plotted this book, even though I had a strong suspicion who the killer was almost from the start. But that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book at all. And when she revealed the killer's backstory, darn if I didn't feel a bit sorry for him! No wonder he turned out to be such a twisted, violent sicko!This book was very reminiscent of a Karen Rose thriller, only...dare I say it? It was better! Because she also gave us a romance with some heat! The book starts out 3 years prior, when our heroine (Seattle free-lance writer/ volunteer child advocate/ aspiring social worker Megan Flynn) and our hero (by-the-book homicide detective Cole Williams) are about to 'get busy' when they're interrupted by a phone call (this happened more than once when they were about to get intimate in this story). Of course this phone call sets the whole plot in motion, since it involves a murder that Megan's brother is a part of. Cole is the arresting officer, and you can kiss his and Megan's relationship goodbye at this point. Three years later their paths cross again (during a murder investigation with striking similarities to her brother's case), and despite a lot of left over animosity from Megan, they both realize that they still have feelings for each other. Cole still thinks that Megan's brother (Sean) is guilty, but he tries to help her anyway in what he thinks is her futile search to find the 'real' killer. As Cole and Megan get closer, he starts to realize that maybe Megan is on to something--did they arrest the wrong man?Yesss, lots of nail-biting suspense in this one, lots of gruesome violence, some sexual tension that pays off nicely in some wickedly hot bedroom (and kitchen and bathroom) scenes, and a conclusion that will leave you frantically biting your nails...Hurry, Cole! When the book ended I still had a few unanswered questions, which hopefully will be answered in the next book.Awesome work--Jami Alden, I think you should write nothing but RS, and I can't wait until Hide from Evil comes out! Beg For Mercy is one of my favorite books of the year--5 big stars!",5.0
9,Hotter After Midnight,Paranormal,"A Seductive Nighttime World. . . Dr. Emily Drake's psychotherapy patients tend to be a little unusual. Instead of midlife crises and mother fixations, Emily treats vampires with blood phobias and sex-demons looking for meaningful relationships. But healing these powerful beings requires an important rule: Never trust a shifter. Especially not one like Detective Colin Gyth, whose gold-flecked eyes and predatory air make Emily realize how much she longs to lose control. . .A Dark And Dangerous Hunger. . .Colin can't believe the doctor he has to work with on the Night Butcher murder case is the one person who could expose his true identity as a wolf shifter. Smart and sexy, Emily brings out the alpha male in Colin, unleashing a wild desire that takes them both over the edge. . . But in the shadows, the Night Butcher waits, eager to spill Emily's blood and taste her terror. And he'll use any means to destroy her, including the one person she has grown to trust. . .","I read this book awhile back and don't have a lot of recollection of the details of the story however, I do recall having a hard time forming any real connection with the characters, but I did enjoy the plot. To be honest, my favorite parts of the book were the sessions with Dr. Emily Drake's psychotherapy patients. A Succubus who wanted to be looked at as more than just a sex symbol, a vampire who didn't want to drink blood... those were some funny characters!While I think this book suffers from FITSs, First In The Series syndrome  it was still a good read and I plan to continue the series.",3.0
10,When You Dare,Romance,"The tougher they are, the harder they fall…Professional mercenary Dare Macintosh lives by one hard and fast rule: business should never be personal. If a cause appeals to him and the price is right, he'll take the mission he's offered. But then the lovely Molly Alexander asks him to help her track down the men who'd had her kidnapped—and for the first time, Dare's tempted to combine work with pleasure.Fiercely independent, Molly vows to trust no one until she's uncovered the truth. Could the enemy be her powerful, estranged father? The ex-fiancé who still holds a grudge? Or the not-so-shy fan of her bestselling novels? As the danger heats up around them, the only anchor Molly has is Dare himself. But what she feels for him just might be the most frightening thing of all…","First impressions: Hello, pretty cover. I'd ask how you are, but I think it's fairly obvious. You're doing great. So what's going on back there, behind your beautiful abs of awesome? No, you're right. I don't really care.Lasting impressions: A smart, strong woman meets a smart, strong man and somehow both are surprised they fall in love. I'm all about the slow burn, but with this one I was snapping my fingers hoping they'd move it along. I gots thangs to do.Conflicting impressions: Dare is a mercenary, and a lot of time is spent talking about his job or watching him protect Molly, but we get snubbed when it comes to actually seeing his dare I say, daring rescue? I could pun all day with this guy.Overall impressions: It took me probably three weeks to get through this book. I would read a few chapters, put it down, then not ever really get the urge to pick it back up. I was on board with a handsome mercenary who rescues a young woman, then falls in love while trying to track down her kidnappers. If only that was the book I got.Instead, I got a really boring but handsome rich dude who says he's a killer mercenary but in reality is just dull and likes dogs. A LOT. He calls them ""his girls"" and I think that's supposed to be cute but I thought it was weird. The author wanted to make us think he had daughters by using this vague phrase. Yeah. We get it. Very clever.The book starts after the main event, which annoyed me. Dare has just rescued this woman out of the goodness of his heart while actually in Mexico to rescue his friend's sister from human traffickers. There was this extra American lying around so he just scooped her up and put her in the bin with the others. It's a good thing Lori Foster doesn't try to make Molly feel indebted to him for going out of his way to save her because that would be super extra annoying.But no. Molly feels indebted not because Dare rescued her, but because she hasn't paid him. She spends the rest of the book worrying about the expenses Dare is racking up in order to get her things like food, clothing, and shelter (the nerve!) and is so overly apologetic about being scared and seemingly weak that she drives Dare (and us) crazy.The secret is that Dare doesn't think she's crazy for being scared. He thinks she's actually handling things really well and is so impressed with how awesome and strong she is that he wants to smooch her. Instead of going all Moonstruck and slapping Molly while Cher-ily telling her to ""Snap out of it!"" he just dives in and plants a kiss on a shell-shocked recovering kidnapping victim who was beaten and starved in a Mexican shack for almost two weeks.Surprisingly, Molly reacts by wondering if she can get some more of that smooching. That pain in your eye? That's called an eyeroll sprain. You may want to go put some ice on that.The single most frustrating part of this book was that despite the somewhat forgivable back-and-forth nature of the characters' escalating feelings, the plot itself didn't really go anywhere. We come in after the exciting rescue and then spend a few hundred pages watching Molly try to build her life back up to normal, then spend the last 50 pages finding out whodunnit and watching Dare take them down in a very brief scene. Where was the danger I was promised in the summary? I wanted way more action than I got, and was disappointed with how slowly the book moved.Our main characters spent most of the book telling each other the same thing over and over again, highlighting their mutual admiration. ""You're perfect."" ""No, you're perfect."" ""You're so strong."" ""No, you're so strong."" ""I secretly love you."" ""No, I'm the one in love with you secretly."" Ad nauseam. If you can stomach the slow pace and just want to follow the romance, this is for you. If you're looking for some excitement or surprises, I wouldn't recommend it.",2.0

WOW.I almost didn't give this book a chance. I tried reading it a long time ago (twice) but I never got past the prologue. I thought I wouldn't like it.But, oh how wrong I was!Because this is, hands down, best Linda Howard's book. I will never forget it. Never.The hero and the heroine are one of the most lovable characters in the entire romantic suspense genre. How can you not love them?Milla. One of the best heroines ever. She is such a strong character. She's honest, fierce, loyal, persistent. I love her and admire her from the bottom of my heart.Diaz.
There was nothing romantic about Diaz, no murmured sweet things, no gallant gestures, just this kiss that went on and on, deep and voracious. She’d never been kissed like this before, with an intensity that stripped everything down to the simplest components: male, female. He held her with his hand burrowed into her hair, her skull gripped in his palm, her head tilted back while he fed from her mouth. That was what it felt like, a taking. And yet he gave, too.It was sex as she had never known it before, raw and powerful, surprisingly sophisticated in execution but primitive in design and intent.
He is NOT just another perfect book boyfriend. He is NOT just another hottie you forget as soon as you start the next book. He deserves a shelf of his own. He belongs to the Best Hero Ever Hall of Fame. Right next to Joe Callahan, Remington Tate, Lee Nightingale and other badassest of all the badass heroes out there. Because they are in a league of their own. Dark. Deadly. Dangerous. Stoic. Silent. Brooding. Rugged. Hot. Faithful. Devoted. Strong men. Manly men. Real men in every sense. Yum.I'm not going to lie, this book is not an easy read. It ripped my heart out. It deals with a very difficult subject matter but the author handled it beautifully. But don't worry, it doesn't deal with dead exes, love triangles or cheating and it does end with a HEA .If you’ve read Linda Howard’s books before then you already know how talented she is. But this book is written with such passion and intensity that you will never forget it for as long as you live.It is perfect style-wise, plot-wise, character-wise and length-wise.If you loved this book as much as I did, please recommend me another book as good as this one. I need more.",5.0

There have been far too many naïve virgins in this series.What I didn’t like:* What sort of a sloppy kidnapper doesn’t notice that their victim has stolen their phone from them?* What sort of a sloppy kidnapper doesn’t care when he eventually realises said phone is missing?* What sort of person rescues someone who’s been kidnapped and nearly been raped, and starts kissing them without their permission?* ‘I found myself wondering what he looked like in a uniform'really? You’ve been kidnapped, you nearly got raped, and now you're getting shot at, and you're wondering what your rescuer looks like in a uniform?

3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0

Why does his life look nothing like he thought it would? What about Cambridge, and Holly?

19,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

20,Memory Piece,Fiction,"In the early 1980s, Giselle Chin, Jackie Ong, and Ellen Ng are three teenagers drawn together by their shared sense of alienation and desire for something different. “Allied in the weirdest parts of themselves,” they envision each other as artistic collaborators and embark on a future defined by freedom and creativity.By the time they are adults, their dreams are murkier. As a performance artist, Giselle must navigate an elite social world she never conceived of. As a coder thrilled by the internet’s early egalitarian promise, Jackie must contend with its more sinister shift toward monetization and surveillance.

21,Cascade Failure,Science Fiction,"L. M. Sagas' debut, Cascade Failure, is a highly commercial, sci-fi adventure blending J. S. Dewes' Divide series with the broad fan appeal of The Expanse and the cozy sf of Becky Chambers. It features a fierce, messy, chaotic space fam, vibrant worlds, and an exploration of the many ways to be―and not to be―human.There are only three real powers in the universe: the corporate power of the Trust versus the Union's labor's leverage. And between them, the Guild tries to keep everyone's hands above the table. It ain't easy.Branded a Guild deserter, Jal ""accidentally"" lands a ride on a Guild ship. Helmed by an AI, with a ship's engineer/medic who doesn't see much of a difference between the two jobs, and a ""don't make me shoot you"" XO, the Guild crew of the Ambit is a little . . . different.They're also in over their heads. Responding to a distress call from an abandoned planet, they find a mass grave, and a live programmer who knows how it happened. The Trust has plans. This isn't the first dead planet, and it's not going to be the last.Unless the crew of the Ambit can stop it.Ambit's Run seriesCascade Failure","I would like to thank Edelweiss and Tor Books for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.This was a super simple galaxy romp, with an interesting crew and a full of ""feelings"" AI captain. There was a touch of tension, some running-through-the-marketplace action and some performative melodrama that was about as believable as Saint and Jal's ""die for each other"" vibe being a ""nothin' but bros"" flex. Regardless, this had potential but it read a bit flat to me. I honestly don't think I'm the ""goofy"" SciFi type. I thought Anke was weird... and not in the good way. And her dialogue was exceptionally cringe. Nash's too. I was NOT a fan of either of these two, and I think there's a definite line between quirky and immature, and I would have enjoyed this book so much more had these two characters read less puerile. I'm probably not the intended reader for this, so I won't belabour the point, because I'd like to forget how awkward I felt reading their POVS. Other than that, Cascade Failure isn't doing anything new, but there were still some fun moments scattered throughout. I enjoyed the first part much more than the second, and somehow I'd found a deep well of patience for whatever the fk was going on between Saint and Jal that kept me intrigued enough to stick it out. But like most of this book, there just wasn't enough depth in the characterizations, or the plot for that matter, for me to feel invested in the outcome.I do like Saint and Jal and Eoan a lot though, even if they are just the prototypical soldier-cyborg-AI triad that's pretty much a genre staple, so there's that. Cascade failure isn't reinventing the wheel, and will appeal more to those new/unfamiliar with the genre. But there's a bit of potential here and I'm curious enough to see where the Ambit is headed to next, so I'll probably continue this series a bit later on...once enough time has passed and I've significantly forgotten how cringey I found both Anke and Nash to be.",3.0
22,The Mars House,Science Fiction,"In the wake of environmental catastrophe, January, once a principal in London’s Royal Ballet, has become a refugee on Tharsis, the terraformed colony on Mars. In Tharsis, January’s life is dictated by his status as an Earthstronger—a person whose body is not adjusted to Mars’s lower gravity and so poses a danger to those born on, or naturalized to, Mars. January’s job choices, housing, and even transportation options are dictated by this second-class status, and now a xenophobic politician named Aubrey Gale is running on a platform that would make it all worse: Gale wants all Earthstrongers to be surgically naturalized, a process that can be anything from disabling to deadly.When Gale chooses January for an on-the-spot press junket interview that goes horribly awry, January’s life is thrown into chaos, but Gale’s political fortunes are damaged, too. Gale proposes a solution to both their problems: a five-year made-for-the-press marriage that would secure January’s financial future without naturalization and ensure Gale’s political future. But when January accepts the offer, he discovers that Gale is not at all like they appear in the press. And worse, soon, January finds himself entangled in political and personal events well beyond his imagining. Gale has an enemy, someone willing to destroy all of Tharsis to make them pay—and January may be the only person standing in the way.","On my blog.
Rep: achillean mc, agender li, agender societyGalley provided by publisherIn the months between reading The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House, I made a promise with myself: if Natasha Pulley’s next book didn’t do away with the misogyny that has characterised her previous five books to varying degrees (as I mentioned in my 
Valery K
 review), then I would give up on her future books. Well, I have good news on that front, because there was no misogyny in this one!If only because there were no women* whatsoever.Now, this really isn’t my primary issue with the book, except that I think it ties in with a general misunderstanding of gender which undercuts anything this book might be trying to say about the topic (this is, to be perfectly honest, my most generous take on it. That it’s trying to say anything at all, notwithstanding the question of whether it’s capable of doing so). No, this is merely a single issue within a sea of them, which, lucky you!, I will be enumerating in this review. Stop reading now if you want to a. avoid spoilers, or b. simply desire the feeling of wanting to read this book. For those of you who read further, well. Godspeed.There are very few reviews which I can’t just write from my notes, but my notes are so long and cumbersome for this one that I have actually needed to sit down and get them in order before even attempting a review. In trying to group together all of my problems here, I think most of it comes down to failures in worldbuilding. A second, smaller but not more minor, set of issues relates to the characters. A final set — and this one I can call more minor — regards Pulley’s writing itself, which I never thought I’d say, having loved it in at least four of her previous five. Oh and then, one big glaring, what the fuck bit.So, let’s take them one by one.— The worldbuilding.1. Gender.We’re starting with one of the two big issues straight up and that’s Pulley’s treatment of gender. Or, to be more exact, the way she has created a society without gender. Firstly, I have to say, reading this at the same time as Ann Leckie’s Imperial Radch, a sci-fi series that thinks about gender in an interesting way, was a mistake. All it did was show up how badly it was done here.Pulley’s concept of gender is solely based on pronoun use. It took me a little while to figure it out (mostly because I couldn’t believe the justification would be this inane), but the reason everyone on Mars uses they pronouns is twofold: one, they all speak Mandarin and, because in spoken Mandarin ‘he’ and ‘she’ sound the same, they decided instead to just make it a ‘they’ pronoun and apply it to everyone. Thus, we have a distinction between the “civilised” Martians (who are a few generations removed from having travelled from Earth to Mars) who only use ‘they’, and the “uncivilised” refugees who still insist on using ‘he’ and ‘she’. And secondly, while choosing to use ‘they’ — which I also want to note was, it sounds, just an arbitrary decision — they also eliminated “extreme gender traits” in DNA. Whatever that means!All of this, I think, just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of our own concept of gender in the 21st century, let alone what a concept of gender a few decades down the line might look like. But what we can safely say is that, if it’s not based on pronouns now, it’s hardly going to suddenly convert to being based on pronouns in the future, is it? Not to mention the whole pronouns thing is actually being translated from Mandarin to make this happen. The characters are speaking Mandarin as the book happens, albeit a Mandarin which has had a few generations to develop from Mandarin as we know it now (enough, it seems, for Mars to exact genetic alterations on humans too, while not being that far removed into the future. And here I was thinking these things moved slowly…). I could buy that there’s a ‘they’ pronoun developed in this futuristic Mandarin. I cannot buy that they basically said “well, these two words sound the same so let’s merge them together”. That is. Not how language works! Not to mention that these words in written Mandarin are still different. You can’t just smush them together and translate them as ‘they’ because they sound the same. Are you going to do that in English for ‘sun’ and ‘son’? No! And, even in spoken Mandarin, there’ll often be context to tell you which pronoun the speaker means, so I would imagine it’s rarely hugely ambiguous. Mandarin speakers are not considering themselves to be going around calling everyone ‘they’ because the words sound the same. (Plus, I feel it’s somewhat disrespectful to nonbinary Mandarin speakers who, you know, might want their own pronouns?) (P.S. for a more accurate take from a Mandarin speaker, see the first point of this review. My analysis was primarily based on Pulley's claims within the book.)Moving on from the pronouns, let’s come to this whole thing of eliminating extreme gender traits from DNA, thus effectively making everyone agender. It’s hard to put into words just how much this whole idea wants to poke my eyes out. It plays exactly into TERF rhetoric that gender equals biology. By removing the “biology” (questionable to say the least?), you remove the “gender”. So our agender society has TERF-y logic underpinning it. Combine this with the part I mentioned at the start where using ‘they’ makes you “civilised” and ‘he’ or ‘she’ “uncivilised” and you get some really weird shit. There are “pro-gender” terrorists in this and I cannot for the life of me tell if it’s some TERF allegory, or in which direction it’s meant to be. Are the Martians TERFs because of their biological understanding of gender? Are the Earth diaspora TERFs because of their insistence on clinging to Earth ideas of gender (which, by the way, does not appear to include nonbinary or trans people in itself)? Is everyone a TERF???One piece more of information can inform us here: in creating an agender society, Natasha Pulley has, barring the minorest of minor characters, entirely eradicated women from her novel. Maybe no one’s a TERF then. Don’t need feminism if you don’t have women!(That’s sarcastic, btw.)2. In-world racism.Second of the major issues with worldbuilding regards the in-world concepts of racism, and how exactly characters are racist. This is a book about anti-immigrant politics, about a politician whose entire platform rests on xenophobic and racist rhetoric. Basically, what we have here is a book that essentially translates as “far right politician forced to fake-date political opposite and they fall in love”. And yes, I should absolutely have read that blurb and stayed the fuck away. Alas, I do not appear to possess basic survival instincts, but, since I did read this, I can detail exactly what’s awful about it!Let me just say, overall this felt like a very strange take from a British author in the midst of such an anti-immigration Tory government. I don’t want to make any assumptions about Pulley’s personal politics, but uh. Yeah. You’ll see why.Once again, Pulley demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge about how racism works, and falls straight into that SFF trap that has authors try to justify racism (see this article for explanation if you don’t already know this part). It turns out that humans coming to Mars from Earth are, due to the differences in gravity, automatically bigger and stronger than Martians who’ve spent years there and who are frail and fragile in comparison. So much that an Earther might easily kill a Martian with just a tap and are thus forced to remain in literal cages as they go about their day. The reason our love interest in particular is xenophobic is because they were attacked by an Earther and injured a little while before the events of the book take place. Thus, they choose to call for all Earthers to be surgically altered so they’re less strong and pose no threat to Martians (a surgery which drastically ruins Earther quality of life, by the by).Now, January — January is the most frustrating protagonist in this respect. Instead of challenging Gale on their bigotry, he tries to accommodate them. He’s repeatedly saying he disagrees with the idea that Earthers are dangerous, only to turn around and say “well, we are dangerous, we might accidentally kill a Martian”, like he’s justifying it. He wears his cage almost permanently around Gale, and even hands them the key to it, so he can’t take it off until Gale decides they’re not scared of him any longer (a decision which has a negative impact on his own health). He spends a lot of the time advocating for his own oppression. A common conversation between January and Gale will go like so:GALE, A BIGOT: Earthstrongers must be all surgically altered so they’re not dangerous to native Martians.JANUARY, A WET DRIP: You’re a bigot! But actually, you’re right because we are soooo much stronger and sooooo dangerous to you guys :( Yes, we should all be kept in cages :(I don’t even think you can make the effective argument that January’s been indoctrinated by Martian bigotry because he’s not even been there a year! He fails to conform to the pronouns thing, but he’s perfectly happy considering himself dangerous and a potential killer all the time? Uh, okay. It takes a good half of the book for January to stand up to Gale’s xenophobia in any way, at which point it suddenly becomes justified for another reason. Great!There are another couple of questionable aspects to mention before we move on (okay, questionable might be too weak a word). Firstly, there’s an undercurrent of suspicion that the immigrants are coming over to subsume the Martian colony back into Earth China, which isn’t that challenged. I mean, it’s revealed that the end that the non-fascist politician is actually working to do this, so it’s almost like… fascist good??? Secondly, the plot ends with the building of an immigration detention centre. I kid you not, that’s how they resolve the arrival of these refugees. By building a detention centre.But don’t worry, it’s a nice detention centre! It has toilets and everything!3. Other wishy-washy worldbuilding aspects.In general, I think Natasha Pulley’s writing lends itself better to real world fiction, or rather, fiction based in a setting she doesn’t have to make up so much. Where there’s some grounding in what we (and she) already know(s). A lot of the worldbuilding in this one felt somewhat flimsy, included because why not!, rather than because it made sense or added to the narrative.Case in point: the talking mammoths. For some apparent reason, there are both polar bears and mammoths on Mars. And the mammoths have language! They can talk! They can offer Gale political advice! And, I KID YOU NOT, it is from these mammoths, in a single conversation, that Gale learns tolerance and acceptance (and thus uncages January).It was at this point that I’m pretty sure I burst into hysterics and checked out of the book. The talking mammoths felt so entirely out of step with the whole rest of the story, and that they were what prompted Gale’s change of heart (not, you might think, January proving himself trustworthy (as if he should have had to, etc etc))? I give up trying to make sense of anything about this, there’s no point! The only function they appeared to serve (besides the whole teaching tolerance nonsense) was that you can point to the book and say look! It’s got talking mammoths!“Was I just schooled about the nature of good government by a mammoth?” Gale asks. Boy, I really fucking hope not.(It also felt like Pulley wrote the mechanical octopus into The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and has been trying to recapture that kind of effortless whimsy in her books ever since. Alas, talking mammoths are anything but effortless.)— The characters.Everything I have to say from here will get progressively shorter, I’m sure you’re glad to know. In fact, my comments on the characters will probably be the shortest of all. Really, what I want to say here is solely that Pulley’s characters are starting to feel incredibly samey, in particular the last three protagonists she’s written. Thaniel and Merrick are probably her most distinct of characters, followed by Joe (simply because he’s the first of the next three). Yes, they all share similarities (perhaps more than you might want for an author), but not so much as Joe, Valery and January do.This is, likely, a disservice to Joe and The Kingdoms (which is my favourite of Pulley’s books, although I fear testing it by rereading it after this!). He is, after all, the prototype. And maybe my view of Valery and January as very similar to him is borne of the fact that The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House are easily my least favourite Pulley books. But the fact remains that I don’t think any of the three are meaningfully distinct. Their POVs sound exactly the same — a fact which could be put down to writing style, yes — but they also feel like the same character cast in three different plots.There’s also a pattern appearing where Pulley’s couples are made up of a big, brutish-seeming-but-actually-a-gentle-giant character, along with a smaller, frailer character (often also more womanish?? But that could be retrospective analysis from me), and a fair amount is made of their difference in size and power. Admittedly, that last part is greater here simply because the whole thing about physical power is plot-relevant (or rather, bigotry-relevant). Your mileage may vary on how much you can stand the whole size difference schtick, but with six books of couples forming this pattern, I at least am starting to feel a bit like. Ooooh-kaaaay.— The writing.Pulley’s writing is, as ever, lovely, and probably one of the only positive things I have to mention about this book, but even that comes with a caveat. All of Pulley’s books have this quiet kind of gentleness to them, which worked for the first four books and even with the brutality of The Kingdoms, where it felt like the contrast between that gentleness and the non-gentleness of events highlighted the latter. It has not worked well here, much like it didn’t in The Half Life of Valery K. In the latter case, it served more to feel like it was downplaying the horrors of the gulag. This was probably because Pulley was more inclined to fully describe the brutality of The Kingdoms and more likely to brush over it in The Half Life of Valery K (possibly because the romance was between a prisoner and a guard?). In The Mars House, that gentleness becomes tonally quite odd. There’s all this anti-immigrant rhetoric and discussion of disabling surgery and eugenics, and it’s all packaged up in this writing that feels like it obscures those horrors. Like I said, odd.Of course, though, if you had full access to those horrors, if it didn’t feel like there was a blanket being placed over it all to muffle the noise, there would be no way in hell that you could root for Gale as January’s love interest.— The what the fuck bit.Last but not least, and really quite pertinent given that, as I’m writing this, Israeli occupation forces are in the midst of committing genocide in Gaza and every day brings with it more and more horrific war crimes by their soldiers, this book, set in the future, is doing its bit to bring that reality nearer. There are two mentions of Israel in this and, firstly, that’s two too many. One is the mention of an AI having a “wonderful, homely Israeli accent”. Which, yuck, and also you could have chosen any country in the world to make this comment, so why an illegal apartheid state, huh? (Also January is from Britain: why would he consider Israel to be “homely”??) But to make it even more egregious, with the next mention, Pulley erases Palestine in its entirety.I stress that this book is set in the future for this very reason. In Pulley’s future, it seems that Israel has succeeded in its aim of murdering every Palestinian and wiping out their state, culture, and entire existence. There is, in here, a scene set during Christmas, in which a young Martian child reading an Earther book, asks what Bethlehem is. January has no response, so Gale cuts in to say that it’s a town in Israel.A quick google search would tell you that Bethlehem is a town in the West Bank, a.k.a. in Occupied Palestine. Not Israel! In fact, being in the West Bank, in an area where (technically) Israelis are not permitted. So not only has Pulley chosen to normalise the existence of an illegal settler-colonial state in her future-set book, she has also chosen to entirely wipe out the land’s indigenous population. Just giving the IOF a helping hand!So, with this comes to a close possibly the longest review I have ever written, and definitely the longest essay-type thing I have since finishing my dissertation a few years ago. If you’ve stuck with me this far, congrats! I hope I’ve not killed your enthusiasm over this one too much. If you’re skipping to the end, I offer you this TL;DR: in conclusion, fascism solved because the fascist marries someone oppressed 🫶🏻.*This is not quite true because, reading through my notes, I found the following: chapter 20: OH MY GOD IT’S A WOMAN. She lasted for one single chapter though, so I think it barely counts.",1.0
23,Those Beyond the Wall,Science Fiction,"Faced with a coming apocalypse, a woman must reckon with her past to solve a series of sudden and inexplicable deaths in a searing sci-fi thriller from the Compton Crook Award–winning author of The Space Between Worlds.Scales is the best at what she does. She is an enforcer who keeps the peace in Ashtown; a rough, climate-ravaged desert town. But that fragile peace is fractured when a woman is mangled and killed within Ash's borders, right in front of Scales's eyes. Even more incomprehensible is that there was seemingly no murderer.When more mutilated bodies start to turn up, both in Ashtown and in the wealthier, walled-off Wiley City, Scales is tasked with finding the cause—and putting an end to it. She teams up with a frustratingly by-the-books partner and a brusque-but-brilliant scientist in order to uncover the truth, delving into both worlds to track down the invisible killer. But what they find points to something bigger and more corrupt than they could've ever foreseen—and it could spell doom for the entire world.","I blurbed this book, and this is what I said:""A bold, beautiful, gut punch of a story, at turns ferocious and poetic—and sometimes both at once.""AND I MEANT IT.I do want to additionally note that the great strength of this book is its characters, who are pretty much universally complicated people in the sense that their ""complications"" or flaws actually cost them things. Often we see characters who are technically flawed, but their flaws don't actually enter the narrative in a significant way, and I find it far more satisfying when they do. This book succeeds on that level and I was impressed with it.I also stopped to screenshot a few lines because I found them to be really lovely, and here's my favorite one:""Once he's gone, I slide backward through the hologram of what looks like finished steel and slip into the dark the city doesn't know is under its skin."" Anyway, if you haven't read the first in this series, now's the time. I really enjoyed it, but I have to say, I liked this one even more.edit: I forgot to say that the thread of romance in this book made me feel absolutely unhinged (in a positive way)-- it's not a big focus but HI I LOVED IT",5.0

And she'll need the help of her worst enemy to stay alive.","The Revolutionary Marketing:Traditional “couples” and “family” therapy often fails because it fails to create empathy-But now there is a new device called “The Empathyzer-a pair of bracelets which look a lot like smart watches-one worn by each person-allowing you to swap bodies and literally walk in the other person’s shoes.When Mary gets an internship at the company who created “The Empathyzer” she decides to sneak a set out of the building, and give it a try with her best friend and roommate, Elizabeth.At first the two girls are just having a bit of fun! (Freaky Friday!)But then something goes horribly wrong on Halloween, seven years ago….Told in the past and the present the chapters are labeled: Mary (Elizabeth) and Elizabeth (Mary) the first name being the actual person and the second name in parentheses, being the body they are inhabiting.I was intrigued by the premise and IF the author had created a speculative World where we met several pairs of people wearing the Empathyzers with mixed results, I probably would have enjoyed the book. (Think John Marrs)BUT, unfortunately, despite the use of this device to achieve the “desired outcome” this was really just ANOTHER story about a buried SECRET, BETRAYAL, and REVENGE, and not one that I enjoyed.

26,Greatest Hits,Short Stories,"How to summarize the psychedelic, witty, helter-skelter mind of Harlan Ellison?A mind that refused to be contained by something as rudimentary as genre, form, or even a particular label. A mind that created some of the most outrageous short stories and novellas of the science fiction, fantasy, and speculative genres – including “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream,” with its unhinged artificial intelligence bent on torturing what is left of humanity, and “Jeffty Is Five,” featuring a young boy’s mysterious, time-bending powers. A mind that passionately identified with the underdog, sometimes with disastrous results. A mind incandescent with fury, that saw storytelling as “a holy chore.”Assembled by the Harlan and Susan Ellison Foundation, Greatest Hits is an overview of Ellison’s award-winning and highly acclaimed short stories – as well as the stories that Ellison himself most treasured. Featuring a preface by Ellison’s executor and friend J. Michael Straczynski, a foreword by award-winning and bestselling author Neil Gaiman, and an introduction by bestselling author Cassandra Khaw, this collection of short stories and novellas serves as a guide to a writer who left his mark on the twentieth century – and whose legacy is in your hands.","GREATEST HITS by Harlan EllisonPublished: March 26,2024 by Union Square & CoPage Count: 496  The title says it all. Collected into one volume are hand-picked short story gems over the course of Harlan Ellison’s prolific career. If not Award Winners ( like Hugo, Nebula, Bram Stoker) they have been nominated for these awards. Presented by an insightful foreword by Neil Gaiman, these hand picked stories are culled from his prestigious output by his friend and executor of his estate, the wonderful writer, J Michael Straczynski. Horror writer, Casandra Khaw provides a wonderful introduction. This collection is an excellent starting point for new readers, as well as old fans, who want to revel once again in his amazing oeuvre. There are no stinkers here … all are great to amazing.  The following few are some of my personal favorites:“I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream” (1966) …. An amazing prediction and discussion of current thoughts and disputes regarding artificial intelligence“Mefisto In Onyx” (1993) … a mind reader applies his skill to a mass murderer”“Jeffty Is Five” (1977) …. He never grows old and has the ability to access on his radio current episodes of programs cancelled a long time ago“Paladin of the Last Hour” (19896) …. the story source of a great episode of The Twilight Zone“Repent Harlequin, Said TheTicktockman” (1966) …. In a dystopian world “wasting time” is a capital offense Ellison was a prolific writer of speculative fiction, who carefully chose his words … often to express his opinions regarding both social and political issues. He frequently veered into many controversial and current issues; censorship, misogyny, racism, corporate greed, exploitation of artists, and even political corruption. His words were sometimes whimsical, but always vibrant and thought provoking. This is an excellent primer to explore his genius.

It’s the greatest discovery in humanity’s spacefaring history – yet who were its builders and where did they go?Professor Arton Daghdev had always wanted to study alien life up close. Then his wishes become a reality in the worst way. His political activism sees him exiled from Earth to Kiln’s extrasolar labour camp. There, he’s condemned to work under an alien sky until he dies.Kiln boasts a ravenous, chaotic ecosystem like nothing seen on Earth. The monstrous alien life interacts in surprising, sometimes shocking ways with the human body, so Arton will risk death on a daily basis. However, the camp’s oppressive regime might just kill him first. If Arton can somehow escape both fates, the world of Kiln holds a wondrous, terrible secret. It will redefine life and intelligence as he knows it, and might just set him free . . .","Imagine if Jeff Vandermeer's Annihilation and Ursula K Le Guin's The Word For World is Forest had a baby. That's pretty damn close to what we got here with Alien Clay, and I adored it.This is a book about divergent evolution, symbiotic relationships in nature, revolution and uprising and yet, at the same time, becoming a part of the machine in which you live your life.It's full to the brim with Tchaikovsky-isms, with a liberal dose of body horror and all sorts of creepy alien insects and creatures.I'll admit it did take me a little while to get with the first-person perspective - it felt a little clunky and unnecessary at first, but it ended up working brilliantly and it had completely grown on me by the quarter way mark.

29,Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension,Poetry,"It’s easy to believe in the apocalypse when you’re losing your religion.NASA has assured everyone the passage of rogue planet Malachite will be safe, but Crosby's been getting other messages―from a fortune teller and Malachite truther message boards. And now she believes that Malachite will kill everyone who doesn’t ascend to the fourth dimension―a higher plane that transcends physicality.She tries to prepare her friends and family to leave their bodies behind and raise their frequency by changing their diets, wearing the right crystals, and moving into her friend’s bunker before it’s too late. But no one is listening.The more time she spends trying to talk her roommate and her quirky friends into her apocalypse plans, the more Crosby is forced to face the cracks in everything she believes to be true.This novel in verse explores the danger and humanity of conspiracy in a post-truth world through empathy, friendship, and forgiveness.","Not everything is an omen, Crosby. Not everything means something.Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a unique upper YA story told in verse about convictions so strong that they eventually lead to family and friends turning against each other and, in this case, believing in the end of the world. It reminded me sometimes of We Are the Ants by Shaun David Hutchinson (one of my favorite YA books ever), even though both stories are way different. Crosby is an anxious, shaky mess, distrustful, and balancing on the edge of reality and deeply held convictions. She believes firmly in witchcraft, and when her best friend Shannon buys earrings she likes (from Malachite), and Crosby tries to convince her those earrings are not the right match for her, they fall apart. Then, she’s in college and watches at a party through a telescope. When she sees the rogue dwarf planet Malachite, Colby is convinced Sharon’s earrings are a warning and that the planet is a message for something bad to happen.  The writing is beautiful and poetic and so fitting for a story like this. The characters are fully developed, and the descriptions are so vivid, I felt I was there, but even without them, I could read this book only for the writing, immersing myself in the words and the sentences, the cadence, and the rhythm. It’s soft and atmospheric while Crosby’s anxiety and the eeriness of her beliefs bubble under the surface but emerge more and more. Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a fantastic debut, and I can’t thank Rita Feinstein enough for asking me if I wanted to read an ARC. And thank you, Pagestreet YA, for sending me this ARC! Follow me on Instagram",4.0
30,The Midnight Library,Fiction,"Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————

I LOVED this installment!!!! I think this book was the perfect balance of exploring Kenji's voice, getting his funny inner monologue, learning more about the world, and seeing the events of Restore Me from his eyes. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bridge book between books 4 and 5 (honestly, these chapters could have been thrown in at the end of Restore Me because I actually think they better describe the events than Warner and Juliette did), but I still had SO much fun reading it and was laughing and gasping at all the new information and world building and conversations that we didn't see in Restore Me. I have a TON more to say about this with theories and new info reveals but it's 4:30 AM and I've been making my way through this book since midnight so my brain is just a big happy mush in my skull because I love Kenji so much and I adored this novella.Old reviewCONFIRMED KENJI POV!!!!!!!!

32,The Institute,Horror,"In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win.--front flap","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

And in such an impossible paradox, what does Annie owe herself?","this was such a fascinating character study that examines womanhood, autonomy, control, and emotionally abusive relationships. it reminded me of my first relationship where i lacked a sense of identity, received criticism when i showed humanity, and had a constant fear of displeasing him. big oof.",4.0
34,Sea of Tranquility,Fiction,"Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.'","“Isn’t that why we’re here? To leave a mark on wilderness?”
I was one of the few readers (or so it seemed) left underwhelmed by Mandel's Station Eleven when I read it back in 2014. The hype and gushing reviews seemed at odds with the very okay novel I read, which is why I passed on reading The Glass Hotel.Now I'm wondering: should I go back and read the author's other stuff? Because I have to admit I found Sea of Tranquility riveting and beautiful.From what I remember, it is not stylistically that different to Station Eleven-- both are quiet, slow-build stories-- but I found the characters here fascinating and the exploration of both the simulation theory and what, if anything, that means for humans, deeply moving. We begin with several chapters (or ""Parts"") of seemingly unrelated characters and stories, each set in a very different time and place-- Edwin arrives in Canada in the year 1912, Mirella goes to speak to the brother of an estranged old friend in 2020 NYC, Olive visits Earth for a book tour in 2203, scientists investigate the theory that the world is a simulation in 2401. Similar motifs appear in each story and it is clear they are linked, but how?As the stories weave together and overlap, we begin to see the recurring theme in each one until it all comes together in a big picture at the end.I really enjoyed it. There is this nostalgic quality to Mandel's writing that made me feel like I was revisiting places I'd been long ago, even though I obviously hadn't. I don't know if all the pandemic subplots were strictly necessary and I think the author could have achieved the same goal without that being a recurring theme, but this is a small complaint. The novel touches upon the big questions like the meaning of it all and the nature of reality, as well as exploring the human obsession with the end of the world:
“I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.”
And, in the end, it all seems to be saying that maybe there is no meaning, maybe none of it's real, whatever that means, maybe the world is always ending, and maybe the real question is: does it even matter?",4.0
35,A Psalm for the Wild-Built,Science Fiction,"ASIN B08H831J18 moved to the more recent editionCenturies before, robots of Panga gained self-awareness, laid down their tools, wandered, en masse into the wilderness, never to be seen again. They faded into myth and urban legend.Now the life of the tea monk who tells this story is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of ""what do people need?"" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They will need to ask it a lot. Chambers' series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?","If this is not your first Becky Chambers book, you know what to expect. Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she’s been writing what I can only call “comfort science fiction/ cozypunk”, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that’s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, “For anybody who could use a break.”
 “This had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.”
  
It’s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times.
 “I’m tired,” Dex said softly. “My work doesn’t satisfy me like it used to, and I don’t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I’ve done it, I don’t know what to do next. I don’t know what I thought I’d find out here, because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I can’t stay here, but I’m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I’m scared, and I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
In this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other’s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  
This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato’s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea.
 “You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”
This is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia — and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers’ planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs.
 “Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.”
Yes, the questions Chambers raises are those “first world problems” that I’m usually the first one to want to shrug off — but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone — once that basic need has been fulfilled.
“Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”
All in all, it’s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day — but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  
————And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It’s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything — speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot — implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that “We don’t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value” — but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending — or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After “Ancillary Justice” series, I’m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant — that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It’s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it — Panga is pretty much “Pangaea”, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course — but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don’t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that’s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn’t among them. Maybe I’ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. 
“The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”“That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

36,Prophet Song,Fiction,"A fearless portrait of a society on the brink as a mother faces a terrible choice, from an internationally award-winning authorOn a dark, wet evening in Dublin, scientist and mother-of-four Eilish Stack answers her front door to find the GNSB on her step. Two officers from Ireland’s newly formed secret police are here to interrogate her husband, a trade unionist.Ireland is falling apart. The country is in the grip of a government turning towards tyranny and Eilish can only watch helplessly as the world she knew disappears. When first her husband and then her eldest son vanish, Eilish finds herself caught within the nightmare logic of a collapsing society.How far will she go to save her family? And what – or who – is she willing to leave behind?Exhilarating, terrifying and propulsive, Prophet Song is a work of breathtaking originality, offering a devastating vision of a country at war and a deeply human portrait of a mother’s fight to hold her family together.","At first, I thought it would be better to wait a while before I write anything about Prophet Song (2023) by Paul Lynch, just to calm down a little and catch my breath, but then I realized that my ability to build coherent sentences about this reading experience might diminish over time. I devoured this novel in two days. It trapped my attention from the first sentence and ensnared me at once.Prepare to have your emotions wrapped around Paul Lynch’s finger and the strings will be pulled tighter and tighter with every page. The thing I found most impressive about this novel is its atmosphere. The tension keeps growing gradually and the feeling of menace is more and more suffocating. The word exhilarating in the blurb baffled me as I found Prophet Song one of the darkest and most depressing books I have ever read. It depicts the rise of totalitarianism resulting in civil war, seen through the eyes of a family with four children. The novel is set in Ireland at an unspecified time but judging from the technology the characters are using it is contemporary. Bertolt Brecht's motto about the dark times was a perfect choice: the novel protagonist, Eilish, is akin to Mother Courage, dealing with unimaginable traumas. She does her best to keep her family together against all odds. By the way, Mother Courage's son is called Eilif which sounds so similar to Eilish. Both Brecht and Lynch's portrayals of motherhood in the time of moral apocalypse are heart-wrenching.The relief coming from the fact that Prophet Song is a dystopian novel doesn't last long as there is nothing unrealistic about the plot: the nightmarish events could have happened anytime, anywhere. Some passages hit unsettlingly close to home:  The government has taken control of the judiciary by putting their own people in, that’s the nub of the problem, once you get your own people in you can do whatever you like. Sounds exactly like Poland at the moment.Maybe one year and a half ago I would have found Paul Lynch's vision of totalitarianism overdrawn but the war in Ukraine proves that it's not. I couldn't stop thinking of Ukrainian children while reading passages like this: She whispers to him though there are no words for a child this age, no explanation for what has been done and yet what the child will never recall from memory will always be known by him and he will carry it as poison in the blood.Some reviewers complain about the oddity of Paul Lynch's style which is quite unusual indeed. For me, it was definitely this novel's forte. It blends detailed realistic descriptions with dreams and snippets of prose poetry. Prophet Song crushed me almost physically. I owe it a sleepless night. Maybe the concentration of bleakness and darkness in this novel is exaggerated. Sometimes it felt overwhelming, almost insufferable. On the other hand, this book is a clear warning and warnings are seldom whispered or painted with watercolours. It doesn’t take a prophet to foresee that Paul Lynch’s novel will make it to the Booker shortlist and may not stop there.Pablo Picasso, Mother and Child, c. 1951.",5.0
37,Recursion,Science Fiction,"That's what NYC cop Barry Sutton is learning, as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.That's what neuroscientist Helena Smith believes. It's why she's dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent.As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face to face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds, but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?At once a relentless pageturner and an intricate science-fiction puzzlebox about time, identity, and memory, Recursion is a thriller as only Blake Crouch could imagine it—and his most ambitious, mind-boggling, irresistible work to date.","Congratulations for winning of best sci-fi category from goodreads choice awards 2020! This is one of my favorite books of the year! Five OMG I’m suffering from brain cells bleeding and explosion of my last standing grey cells, what the hell I just read and who am I ? stars!I know the drill but let me rephrase one more time! This is not an easy, soft, sunshine and rainbows reading! In my opinion people who are brave enough to dive into this journey should put themselves an IQ test and discover their cognitive skills. ( luckily I read the quantum physics for dummies before the beginning but I feel like I can be great cast for future dumb and dumber movie if they will ever produce the third installment)So this book is amazing combination of time traveling, alternated lifetimes, Minority Reports meet Groundhog Day versus Black Mirror and Back to the Future kinda fascinating science fiction crashes into thriller and romance starting with an effective and memorable suicide attempt scene. A woman suffers from FMS ( false memory syndrome) who thinks her child was being erased, her husband denied her existence so there was nothing better than jump and end her life. But she had small hope in her heart, her husband could come to rescue her but when he didn’t show up, she didn’t want to fight anymore and.... Yes, this book starts with jaw dropping scene and you’re hooked! It’s addictive, unputdownable, nerve damaging, exhausting ride! You wanna know what’s going to happen and think about yourself if I had a chance to save my loved ones by turning back and making my wrongs turn into rights, what would happen! Saving her daughter from the traffic accident, curing your mother’s Alzheimer disease, prevention of school shooting , saving soldiers from the terrorist attacks are just the samples writer show as in alternative realities that have possible to be changed! The difference of Recursion from Dark Matter might be romance parts because I really enjoyed Barry and Helena’s love story. Not only they fought to bring universe into the right pattern but also they fought to get back together to be each other’s final word, everlasting love, end game! This was thrilling, mind bending, provoking book! Dark Matters is going to be Netflix series and I’m already sure that as a brain numbing project, this book finds its place at big screen on near future!Highly recommended, smart, different, unique and exquisite book but not for everyone!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

He has a serious heart condition, and he signed up for Death-Cast so he could know what’s coming.Valentino Prince is restarting his life in New York. He has a long and promising future ahead and he only registered for Death-Cast after his twin sister nearly died in a car accident.Orion and Valentino cross paths in Times Square and immediately feel a deep connection. But when the first round of End Day calls goes out, their lives are changed forever—one of them receives a call, and the other doesn’t. Though neither boy is certain how the day will end, they know they want to spend it together…even if that means their goodbye will be heartbreaking.Told with acclaimed author Adam Silvera’s signature bittersweet touch, this story celebrates the lasting impact that people have on each other and proves that life is always worth living to the fullest.","lmao i finished this masterpiece and now i’ve been staring at walls for hours just thinking about what i just read.just like “they both die at the end” this prequel has multiple narrators but the main ones are Orion and Valentino. and they are some of the most real and deep characters. the timeline for their story is when Death Cast is being introduced and tried for the first time. we see a lot of doubt within almost every character for the trueness of the death cast system. like “does it actually work?” , “there’s gotta be errors in the system,” as many think. it was even more interesting reading from the pov of the death cast creator, Joaquin.just like TBDATE this one was emotional and bittersweet towards the end. tears soaking the page type of shit. i will say, i appreciated how this work wasn’t a repetition of TBDATE, it fully stands on its own as a unique story set in the death cast world. the writing is captivating. and obviously fans of TBDATE will love this but surprisingly i can also see people that didn’t like that book like this oneand side note but we get 1 Mateo and Rufus pov in this one and i fully trained my brain into believing that they’re still breathing alive and well 🤧🤧🤧",5.0
39,The Testaments,Fiction,"When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.With The Testaments, the wait is over.Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.""Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."" --Margaret AtwoodAn alternate cover edition of ISBN 978-0385543781 can be found here.","I guess I'll have to be the one who says what nobody else is willing to say. This novel is terrible, and Booker judges are starstruck, hype-driven sellouts. And that no professional literary critic has the guts to tell the truth about how poorly conceived and written The Testaments is, is a true shame.  I can't decide which work Atwood should be embarrassed for more - Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 or The Testaments. The book doesn't read like a novel written by one of the most lauded authors of the 20st century. The Testaments reads like a standard-issue feminist YA dystopia, filled with every overused dystopian trope and every stereotype, penned by an author who writes for teen audience, and is published by Harper Teen. As such, it undoubtedly has some appeal to a part of Atwood's readership, but literary merit The Testaments has none. If this book had a different name on it, I would have DNFed it after 50 pages for its lack of originality, predictability and mediocre writing style. I’ve read a fair number of similar novels, I am not opposed to them, I enjoyed some of them, and some of them (for example the upcoming The Grace Year) held my attention much better. As an Atwood novel, The Testaments gets one disappointed, angry, heart-broken star from me. Why did the publishers embargo Atwood's new creation, I wonder? Surely there is nothing to spoil. Maybe to conceal its poor execution, or its transparent, shallow, simplistic, and ridiculous plot? The story is told from 3 POVs - Aunt Lydia's and two teen girls' - one growing up in Gilead and another - in Canada. Oh my, who those girls might be? Twist! You can only glimpse Atwood's former brilliance in Aunt Lydia's POV, but just for a few moments here and there. If the whole novel was written about Aunt Lydia, maybe Atwood would have made her journey more convincing, but alas. The other two girls are quintessential YA dystopian heroines - one abused by an evil oppressive regime, and the other - a bratty teen on the run from bad people, but who nevertheless has time for some romance. Yum! Like I said, these POVs are so similar to what's been regurgitated over and over in teen publishing, it's uncanny. Has The Testaments been partially ghost-written by Lauren Oliver? I am not trying to dump on Oliver, she has her fans and her place in the industry, but I expected something infinitely more sophisticated from Margaret Atwood.The new information about Gilead Atwood promised? Well, new details of Gilead made the regime more nonsensical and less plausible than ever before. Who benefits from living in Gilead becomes unfathomable in this book, thus making the entire concept pointless (kind of like in Wither). Totalitarian regimes work, at least temporarily, because they are supported by a mass of true believers. Where are they in this book? But if you yearn for some more torture porn in addition to that supplied by the 3 seasons of the TV show, then sure. Rapists, molesters, killers, suicide victims galore, plus solitary confinement - there is an overabundance of that. All of it written bluntly, rashly, exploitatively and without any kind of nuance. There is no overarching theme in The Testaments except GILEAD IS BAD. The plot to overthrow it is a joke. If you are looking for a clever, thoughtful, well-written companion to The Handmaid's Tale, you are out of luck. If you want a bland, basic TV show fanfic stuffed with action adventure and genre tropes, enjoy! The Testaments was written just for you.",1.0
40,Extinction,Thriller,"Erebus Resort, occupying a magnificent, hundred-thousand–acre valley deep in the Colorado Rockies, offers guests the experience of viewing woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths in their native habitat, brought back from extinction through the magic of genetic manipulation. When a billionaire's son and his new wife are kidnapped and murdered in the Erebus back country by what is assumed to be a gang of eco-terrorists, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Agent Frances Cash partners with county sheriff James Colcord to track down the perpetrators. As killings mount and the valley is evacuated, Cash and Colcord must confront an ancient, intelligent, and malevolent presence at Erebus, bent not on resurrection but on extinction.","In 
Extinction,
 Douglas Preston combines a technothriller with a police investigation. Erebus Resort occupies a large valley in Eagle County, Colorado, deep in the Rocky Mountains. It offers guests the unique experience of viewing six herbivores, including woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths, brought back from extinction through genetic manipulation. When billionaire Rolf Gunnerson’s son Mark and his wife Olivia are abducted while in the Erebus back county, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is called in to help the Eagle County sheriff’s department. This is Agent in Charge Frances Cash’s first case after her promotion to senior detective. She liaises with Sheriff James Colcord to investigate and tract down the culprits.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Cash is organized, detailed, goal-oriented, aggressive, foul-mouthed at times, sharp-tonged, and doesn’t like small talk. She’s viewed by her boss, McFaul, as lacking the public relations side of things and only being focused on solving her cases. Colcord is a movie buff, quiet, treats others with respect, and gets along with most people. However, he can also be forceful and take charge of situations.The author has penned a thriller with action, wonderful animals, plenty of adventure, great lead characters, and genetic engineering that is frightening, exciting, and thought-provoking. This riveting and suspenseful story kept be fully engaged from beginning to end. The plot is twisty with several shocking turns that caught me by surprise. The world-building was excellent from the back-country to the resort lodge to the laboratory. Themes include genetic engineering, deception, betrayal, death, greed, morality, work relationships, and much more.Overall, the book is tense, gripping, and suspenseful. It kept me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would be uncovered next. With great characterization and world-building as well as a fast pace, it’s also thought-provoking and terrifying at times. The afterward at the end of the book has some interesting information as well. I highly recommend this novel to those who enjoy thrillers, police procedurals, near-science science fiction, and mysteries. I hope there is a sequel. I purchased a copy of this novel.

No, I don’t mean the vaccine, although that’s pretty amazing. No, I mean Murderbot is back in a solid novella. While I’m contractually bound to not repeat the approximately 80 highlights I made while reading, I can assure you that it is filled with ‘Bot’s trademark sarcastic thoughts on humans, slow thought processes, and complicated facial expressions.""Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.""In Fugitive Telemetry, ‘Bot is on Preservation Station and has recently discovered a dead–cough, deceased–human.

Or do I go for it?I think you know what I did.While I read, my day fell away, page by page, replaced by sarcastic observations and extremely dry wit. ‘Bot, how I’ve missed you. “I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time.

42,Random in Death,Mystery,"In the new crime thriller from #1 New York Times -bestselling J.D. Robb, a small and easily concealed weapon wreaks havoc, and the killer is just a face in the crowd.Jenna’s parents had finally given in, and there she was, at a New York club with her best friends, watching the legendary band Avenue A, carrying her demo in hopes of slipping it to the guitarist, Jake Kincade. Then, from the stage, Jake catches her eye, and smiles. It’s the best night of her life.It’s the last night of her life.Minutes later, Jake’s in the alley getting some fresh air, and the girl from the dance floor comes stumbling out, sick and confused and deathly pale. He tries to help, but it’s no use. He doesn’t know that someone in the crowd has jabbed her with a needle―and when his girlfriend Nadine arrives, she knows the only thing left to do for the girl is call her friend, Lieutenant Eve Dallas.After everyone on the scene is interviewed, lab results show a toxic mix of substances in the victim’s body―and for an extra touch of viciousness, the needle was teeming with infectious agents. Dallas searches for a Had any boys been harassing Jenna? Was she engaging in risky behavior or caught up in something shady? But there are no obvious clues why this levelheaded sixteen-year-old, passionate about her music, would be targeted.And that worries Dallas. Because if Jenna wasn’t targeted, if she was just the random, unlucky victim of a madman consumed by hatred, there are likely more deaths to come.","Death, suspense, action, and drama immediately pull readers into 
Random in Death
 by J. D. Robb (pseudonym for Nora Roberts). This well-written futuristic police procedural is set in New York City (NYC) in the summer of 2061 and features Lieutenant Eve Dallas with the NYC homicide police department. Sixteen-year-old Jenna Harbough has finally gotten parental approval to watch her favorite band play live at a club. Her idol Jake Kincaid catches her eye while she’s on the dance floor. It’s the best night of her life. Minutes later she stumbles outside and dies. Eve is called to the scene. Was Jenna targeted specifically or was she a random victim?Time spent with Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody (Eve’s partner), and Eve’s colleagues is always entertaining. The main characters are compelling and three-dimensional. Eve is honorable, honest, has strong moral principles, and has a strong sense of duty to victims and their families. Her need to serve and protect comes through in every book, but the underlying impetus for this is best understood by reading this series in order. As always, the interactions between Eve and Roarke are enjoyable and bring a different facet of Eve’s personality to light. It’s fascinating to see how Eve’s mind works getting a better and better picture of the killer. I enjoyed seeing Peabody continue to take on more responsibility in this story line as well as Detective Jenkinson. Readers get to see a bit of the private lives of Peabody and her significant other, McNab. Additionally, Nadine Furst and Jake Kincade share more of the limelight in this novel.It is amazing that after fifty-eight books this author can still use prose to elicit a strong emotional response from readers. The novel has a deeply involved plot that is thought-provoking and tragic. Robb weaves humor into her novels, providing levity to offset some of the more serious and grim aspects of the story. She brings strong characters, great plots, wonderful relationships, and excellent pacing to the series. Woven through the novel are threads of caring for others, standing for victims, friendship, relationships, ego, justice, leadership, love, respect, and trust. Additionally, there are themes of murder, shock, denial, grief, power, rage, dominance, punishment, arrogance, and much more.Robb is an excellent storyteller who combines a creative plot with suspenseful scenes, lots of solid police investigation, and some action. The writing is fluid and the ever-present threat that was looming kept me rapidly turning the pages. Besides the investigation, Dallas’s solid investigative techniques and her relationships with her friends and colleagues drive the narrative. It has the right balance of mystery, police investigation, romance, and creative twists.Overall, this novel was a twisty tale with great characterization that kept me engaged throughout the story. If you enjoy engaging near-future police procedurals, then I recommend this series. This is the fifty-eighth book in the In Death Eve Dallas series and I have read all of them up to this point. I can’t wait to read the next book in the series.St. Martin’s Press and J.D. Robb provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.

45,Dune,Science Fiction,"Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.","In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.",5.0
46,Ender’s Game,Science Fiction,"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","DNF at 52%Dear Orson Scott Card,There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.Sincerely, Women. Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you. Sincerely, Kat. First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;""All the boys are organized into armies.""""All boys?""""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?  2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. Plot Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" Sure. Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. It--just--ugh. It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.",1.0
47,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,Science Fiction,"Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker's Guide (""A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have"") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? Why do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars. And don't forget to bring a towel!","In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.",5.0
48,The Martian,Science Fiction,"Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?","I’m pretty much fucked.
Ok, show of hands. How many of you have uttered these exact words? (or words to that effect). Not everyone? I see we have some liars out there. How many have said them at least twice? Three times? Four? Those with hands still up, you probably need to make some adjustments to your approach, find a safer line of work, hobbies that do not entail long drops, stop trying the weekly specials at McBlowfish, or seek out people to date who are into less extreme…um…sports. These are the opening words of The Martian. Astronaut Mark Watney is definitely more screwed than most of us have ever been. Dude missed his ride and there will not be another along for, oh, four years. Supplies on hand were only meant to cover a few weeks, maybe months. And that Martian atmosphere is definitely no fun, lacking stuff like, oh, breathable air, and a reasonable range of temperature. It does, offer, however, extremely harsh (good for scouring that burned on gunk from sauce pans) and long-lasting (as in months) dust storms. And if that was not enough he faces an array of other challenges. unfriendly locals No, Kibby (the 12-year-old kibitzer who infects my brain), no Mars Attacks brain beasts, or that other guy, even though I know he is your favorite. Real challenges. For example, the music he has for his stay consists of disco. The viewing options include 70s TV. Most of us might give serious consideration to minimizing the guaranteed pain, frustration, starvation and inevitable death by, maybe, taking a short hustle outside sans that special suit. It would be a very, very short last dance. Watney is either a cock-eyed optimist or an idiot. I'm going with the former, as he is indeed made of the right stuff. He is armored and well supplied with the sort of can-do designer genes that might make the rest of us feel like the can’t-do sorts we are. He is the poster boy for positive attitude. It does not hurt that he is way smart, with expertise in a wide-enough range of things scientific to matter. It does not hurt that he is an engineer who gets off on taking apart, putting back-together, figuring out, thinking through, testing, trying, and pushing envelopes. But his crew is headed home, and what hope is there, really?The Martian tells of Watney’s attempt to survive in a literally alien environment, using only the tools on hand and his wits. It is a gripping story with one of the most adorable heroes you are likely to encounter, on this planet or any other. (No, Kibby, not a kitten) How could you not root for a guy who scrapes through Thanksgiving dinner for potato parts to plant for food? Of course, one might think “been there, done that,” particularly as 1964’s  Robin Crusoe on Mars  offered a retelling of Daniel Defoe’s classic tale in a more contemporary notion of a remote locale. A 1905 novel used a different classic traveler in the same sort of format. Of course those tellings had a lot more in common with the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs as seen by Frank Frazetta than they do with the vision we have of the Red Planet today, or, say, reality. RealityOr is it?One of these was a shot of you know where. The other was taken at Death Valley, which was used, BTW, in the filming of Robinson Crusoe on MarsMost of the tale is spent on Watney’s very compelling attempt to survive, going through all the challenges he faces trying to make air, preserve and maybe generate water, make his food last, get some sort of communication set up, deal with things like exploding air-locks, biblical level dust-storms, toppling ground-transport vehicles, you know, stuff, most of it life-threatening. The other end of things is how the folks on the ground deal with this GInornous OOPS. There are technical elements, of course but more interesting, for me, were the political considerations. To tell the crew or not? Imagine how bummed out, embarrassed, and guilty you might be on that ship (the Hermes) returning home, knowing you had left one behind. Might it affect your ability to take care of necessary business for the next bunch of months? Another question is whether to tell the public, and if so, when. How about getting help from other space-capable nations? Are any international dealings simple? There is also some in-house (NASA) staff maneuvering that is wonderful to see.Andy WeirIn her fabulous book on writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes
Having a likeable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud…
Probably the greatest strength of The Martian is the narration of Mark Watney. He is engaging and funny, optimistic and capable. I suppose there are some who might find him lacking in sharp edges, but I thought he worked great. Matt Damon as Mark Watney, enjoying the view  – from the film. The new earth-based shooting location was Wadi Rum, Jordan. I am sure they did plenty of color adjustments in post, but boy-o-boy does this place look like an alien landscape. GripesYes, really, there is too much scientific detail. It is not that it is beyond the comprehension of a lot of readers (although it will skip by a fair number) it is the share of time, the number of pages, the sheer volume of obstacles to be overcome, and the very detailed explanation of so many of them that tilts the book a bit too much towards the MacGyver demo. Weir writes very well about the other elements of the story. Repetition of DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, with the subsequent amazingly clever repair du jour, does get a bit old after a while. I had to fight an urge to scan at times. But that is really it. Otherwise, The Martian is an absolute delight to read. Watney is lovable as well as capable, and makes excellent use of his sense of humor to look on the bright side of life, in a very dark circumstance. Whether he makes it out on time or not (not gonna spoil that one) you will cheer him on, hope for the best, and fly past those pages with considerable, if maybe not interplanetary, speed. Is there life on Mars? There will be while you read this book.

49,Ready Player One,Science Fiction,"The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.","I originally gave this book 3 stars as harmless lightweight fun, but my opinion of it declined as time went by. Then after reading Armada I fully realized what a talentless one-trick hack that Cline really is so I changed this rating. Plus, his outraged hardcore fans kept coming on here and telling me that I missed the point since I didn't give it 5 stars so I might as well give them something to really be mad about. If you're one of those Cline fans who wants to whine about it in the comments I will just delete it and block you.Adventures in Time MowingAfter my laptop fused to my lawn mower due to a freak lightning strike, I discovered that I could use it to travel through time.“Wow, where’d you come from?”“I’m from 2011. Got a time mower and decided to come to the future. I’ll spare you the full origin story. My name’s Kemper.”“I’m Wade Watts. Welcome to 2044.”“Thanks. I gotta say, things are looking kind of grim around here. Are those mobile homes stacked up like hillbilly skyscrapers?”“Yeah, I live in one of them. We’ve had a lot of problems once the cheap fossil fuels started running out. Life kinda sucks ass these days. Fortunately, we’ve got the OASIS.”“What’s that?”“It’s this virtual reality that’s kind of a combination of the Internet and the biggest MMORPG ever made. Here put this on, and I’ll show you.”“Hey, this is pretty sweet, Wade. But what’s with all this old stuff here in your virtual room. It looks like the ‘80s vomited in here.”“Oh, it’s part of my research for the contest. See the guy who invented the OASIS was this old nerd named James Halliday. He left an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS and whoever finds it wins the prize. He was totally obsessed with the ‘80s and nerdly stuff like computers, sci-fi, cartoons, movies, comics and video games. He left three keys to three gates hidden in here, and the clues have to be stuff that he loved. So a lot of people like me have to know all about the '80s to hunt for the egg.""“How long has this been going on?”“For years now. Nobody has found the first key yet.”“And you what? Watch movies from the ‘80s? Listen to the music? Read his favorite books? Play old video games?”“It‘s even bigger than that. Because of the contest, the entire world is obsessed with the ‘80s. The clothes and hairstyles are considered cool again.”“Really? Well, I gotta get the hell out of here then. Thanks for showing me this, Wade. How do I log out?”“You’re leaving already? Don’t you want to…Oh, my god! You said you were from 2011? And you’re in your 40s, right?”“Well, just barely…”“So you actually lived through the ‘80s?”“Afraid so. High school class of 1988.”“That’s awesome! You gotta tell me all about it, Kemper.”“Kid, why would you want to hear about that? You’re sitting here with enough computer power to download everything from the collected works of Shakespeare to the entire run of The Wire and you want to hear about the ’80s? Just for a contest?”“I love the ’80s. It was the coolest time ever!”“Uh, not really. In fact, I think the ’90s beat the shit out of them. That not worrying about the Cold War thing was a relief and the music was a lot better. Plus we got to wear flannel. That was fun.”“But… you got to play the old video games in the actual arcades, and you saw the first generation of home computers come out. Plus, music videos and John Hughes movies and Rubik’s Cubes and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album and….”“Yeah, Wade. I lived through it all. I remember when MTV played music videos and when Eddie Murphy was funny. But you’re making me sad, kid.”“Why?”“Lemme tell you a story, Wade. About ten years after I got out of high school, an old buddy I had stayed in touch with had a birthday bash and invited a bunch of us that used to run around together. So we’re at his house drinking and playing cards just like the old days and catching up and playing ‘Remember when?”. It was a lot of fun, but we’d been listening to hair metal and classic rock all night, and at one point, I was flipping through the CD’s.”“Actual CD’s! Not downloads?”“Hell, I’m so old even my post-high school stories are dated now. Yes, Wade, real CD’s. Anyhow, I found a new Foo Fighters album, and I put it in. And this one guy made a face and asked me why I had taken the Guns-n-Roses out. And I said something like the nostalgia had been fun but I needed something from that decade. Being completely serious he said that he didn’t know how I could listen to that stuff, and that he still listened to the same exact music we did in high school. He had just replaced his old cassettes with CD’s. The guy had completely managed to miss grunge and was perfectly happy with the same play list in 1998 that he’d been listening to in 1988. And that was one of the saddest things I ever heard, Wade.”“But maybe he just really liked that stuff.”“I liked it too, once upon a time. And I can still belt out a pretty good version of Relax when Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on the radio, but it was a certain time and place. Now it’s done. I find it depressing that someone of Gen X would want to be stuck there and never moved on to anything new. But it got worse after that, Wade. Because we got older and then the media started catering to us by going for nostalgia trips on everything from trying to remake the Knight Rider TV show to shitty movies like The Transformers and G.I. Joe to the goddamn Smurfs. I’m tired of it in 2011, Wade. I don’t want a new Indiana Jones movie, I want the NEXT Indiana Jones. But no one is working on that because all of us got obsessed with regurgitating our childhoods over and over.”“That is kind of sad, Kemper.”“What’s even sadder is seeing it happen to a generation that didn’t even live through it. When I was a teenager, I got sick to death of baby boomer nostalgia and there’d be these kids my age who tried to be like damn dirty hippies by wearing tie-dye shirts and going to listen to Grateful Dead tribute bands. They were nostalgic for an era that wasn’t even theirs, and I always thought it was a waste. Don’t be like that, Wade. You seem like a nice kid. Don’t sit here watching Family Ties reruns and playing Space Invaders and making jokes about Ewoks. That was then. This is now. It’s your time and you should be out there trying to find the stuff that will become part of your own memories of growing up, not rehashing ours.”“Gee, Kemper. That’s a really good point. You’ve opened my eyes. Thanks a lot.”“You’re welcome, Wade. By the way, what the hell was this prize that was so good that it got the entire world doing the safety dance again?”“Oh, the winner gets the controlling interest in Halliday’s company and his personal fortune which is about $240 billion dollars.”“Did you say $240 billion? Dollars?”“Yes, so how about we log off. Maybe I’ll take a walk and see if I can find this girl I like. I’ve been…”“Screw that. Fire this rig up, Wade. Put on some Def Leppard and find me a pair of acid washed jeans and some high top Reeboks. Let’s start looking for clues. For $240 billion I’ll live through the ‘80s again.”**************************************************I didn’t actually hate this book. It did a lot of very clever stuff regarding an entire virtual universe. And for a member of Gen X, it was a fast and fun romp down memory lane. It was kind of like Snow Crash meets the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie.But I’ve got a personal pet peeve against people trying to live in the past and since this book is nostalgia porn*, the basic premise did rub me the wrong way. The idea that the kids of the 2040s are just watching episodes of ‘80s TV shows and playing Donkey Kong really kind of depressed me. *I stole that phrase from Flannery’s review. Sorry, Flannery! It was just too good.I might have been able to get past it a little easier if at least one of the kids said something like, “Jesus, I hate this ‘80s bullshit. I can’t wait until his freakin’ contest is over so I can live in the here and now.” But instead all of them treat it like it’s the greatest entertainment ever. So even though a few post ’80s things like Firefly or the Lord of the Rings movies get mentioned, we’re supposed to believe that nerd pop culture reached a zenith in the ’80s and nothing worth geek obsession happened between 1990 and 2040? Sorry, but that seems kind of unlikely and the kind of wishful thinking that an aging Gen Xer would write as he pines for his glory days.",1.0
50,Fahrenheit 451,Fiction,"Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.","As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing.",2.0

52,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
53,Brave New World,Classics,"Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New Worldd likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. ""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune","I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.

This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like... 

Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...

The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...

Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.3.0 Stars. Recommended.",3.0
54,Foundation,Science Fiction,"Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.","Honestly, I don't get why this book/series is so popular. There are some interesting elements to it (for instance, the use of religion as a tool of mass control and the implicit resultant argument that religion is no more than a fraud, ""the opiate of the people,"" after all), but the book gave me little to enjoy or dig into. The forces of the novel are broad, historical, dealing with masses of people; this means that there is little to no room for individual characters here and little to be done by the few characters who do appear. One leader says, in fact, in response to a crisis, the threat of warfare and annihilation, ""I'm going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis"" (191). This is a recurring theme. Plus, there are no female characters to speak of. One man's wife makes a brief and apparently unnecessary appearance for a page-long chapter, but that's it. All else is done by and to men.There are a couple of minor things I do like about the book. One is Salvor Hardin's statement that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" which I like for its endorsement of nonviolent alternatives. Another is the characters' habit of saying ""Space"" or ""Galaxy"" instead of God when they exclaim or curse.",2.0
55,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
56,Murder Road,Horror,"July 1995. April and Eddie have taken a wrong turn. They’re looking for the small resort town where they plan to spend their honeymoon. When they spot what appears to be a lone hitchhiker along the deserted road, they stop to help. But not long after the hitchhiker gets into their car, they see the blood seeping from her jacket and a truck barreling down Atticus Line after them.When the hitchhiker dies at the local hospital, April and Eddie find themselves in the crosshairs of the Coldlake Falls police. Unexplained murders have been happening along Atticus Line for years and the cops finally have two witnesses who easily become their only suspects. As April and Eddie start to dig into the history of the town and that horrible stretch of road to clear their names, they soon learn that there is something supernatural at work, something that could not only tear the town and its dark secrets apart, but take April and Eddie down with it all.","Simone St. James delivers another solid SUPERNATURAL thriller, which might just raise the hairs on your arms…and it’s NOW AVAILABLE! Happy publication day!! “If You See Her, You”ll Be The Next One Dead On The Side of the Road” July 1995: Eddie and April are newlyweds heading to a cabin for their honeymoon-part of a hotel on the shore of Lake Michigan. They had scrimped and saved and had been able to book five nights, planning to swim, BBQ burgers, drink beer, play scrabble and go to bed. Repeat five times and then head home to Ann Arbor where they would go to work all day, come home at five, have a sandwich together, go to bed, and repeat again, forever and ever, secure in their marital bliss. But, something along the way, made Eddie take a wrong turn onto Atticus Line, a dark, deserted strip of road that has taken the lives of several hitchhikers over the past nineteen years, the first occurring in 1976. Then, in the beam of their headlights, they saw a figure walking that appeared to need help, and stopping will change EVERYTHING. Rhonda Jean isn’t drunk- she is bleeding-and although they rush her to the hospital in ColdLake Falls, when she dies, they somehow become “suspects” instead of the Good Samaritans they are! Caught up in the mystery, of the original Jane Doe found, dubbed “The Lost Girl”, -they try to clear their names, but when they see her, they have to wonder if she IS just an urban legend ?! WILL ONE (OR BOTH) BECOME HER NEXT VICTIM? Fortunately, they will have the help of Rose, the proprietor of the B &B they are placed in by local Police, and Beatrice and Gracie Snell, two resourceful teenaged sisters who are better sleuths than the detectives in charge. Full of fun 90’s nostalgia, and several eerie, ominous car rides-you will want to scream at Eddie and April whenever they venture back onto Atticus Line. Just 👀 look at that gorgeous cover of the oncoming headlights on the desolate MURDER ROAD! Then, as I flipped the pages on my Kindle, there was a dark line beneath each numbered chapter, which seemed to move as you reached the first page of every chapter-reminding me of the rhythmic flash of dashed lines you see dividing two lanes on highway at night as you speed past! Creepy! If you have enjoyed the author’s work in the past, you don’t want to miss this one! 4.5 ⭐️  Thank You to Berkley for the very early gifted copy provided through NetGalley. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!",4.0
57,The Last Murder at the End of the World,Mystery,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.",Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...,2.0

One would almost never suspect the dark history lurking behind its perfectly maintained facade.At first, the building and its eclectic tenants couldn’t feel more welcoming. But as the Lowans settle into their new home, Rosie starts to suspect that there’s more to the Windermere than meets the eye. Why is the doorman ever-present? Why are there cameras everywhere? And why have so many gruesome crimes occurred there throughout the years? When one of the neighbors turns up dead, Rosie must get to the truth about the Windermere before she, too, falls under its dangerous spell.","Wow! ""666 Park Avenue"" meets ""Rosemary’s Baby"" with spine-tingling supernatural vibes! Lisa Unger takes us on another heart-throbbing journey into the paranormal and psychological thriller realm, transporting us to a claustrophobic residence in Manhattan. Here, murders, suicides, and jaw-dropping scandals haunt the place along with its creepy occupants, including an extra-creepy doorman who seems like he never sleeps, always watching and listening. Welcome to Windermere, a haven for creative souls such as artists, writers, performers, and, of course, sensitive occultists like mediums and astrologers. These eccentric inhabitants have lived in the same location for decades, appearing at least twenty years younger than their actual ages, prompting theories about possible vampiric tendencies. But I won't give away any spoilers; you'll have to read to test my far-fetched, silly theory!Enter the happy yet financially struggling couple, Rosie and Chad Lowan, who hit the jackpot when they inherit Chad’s late uncle Ivan’s Windermere apartment. However, Ivan’s only daughter Lana is far from pleased, appearing at their apartment out of nowhere, throwing threats to sue them and casting doubt on Chad's innocence. Despite the initial challenges, Rosie sees the positive side: a $5 million apartment and the opportunity to interview her new neighbors about the dark history of Windermere, becoming the subject of her new true crime novel. The Park Avenue residence, with its grisly murders, suicides, and terrible accidents, becomes the backdrop for Rosie's investigation. The history of the building, its unique architecture, and the fact that it was built on the site of a burned-down church all captivate Rosie like a moth to a flame.However, as they move in, Rosie senses that Windermere has its own sinister soul, slowly penetrating her skin. She keeps seeing a young boy who disappears when she turns her back, and the doorman, Abi, seems to know everything about their lives, even daring to lie to make Rosie question her sanity. Sudden deaths around them make Rosie question her past life, having run away from occultist parents who believed she had powers to see the future and other entities that nobody could conjure up. As the thin veil between reality and illusion fades away, Rosie realizes that nobody close to her is as innocent as they seem. Moving into Windermere might put her life in danger. Can she run without looking back? Can she save herself? The occult vibes, including devil eye pendants, astrology seances providing insight into the Taurus sign, ghostly appearances, and a family of dreamers and healers, hooked me easily. This riveting page-turner with multiple ongoing incidents keeps you on your toes, pushing you to make sense of it all. There's an ongoing murder investigation, unexplainable incidents in Windermere, and thankfully, the reasoning behind all these events is explained as rationally as possible, avoiding far-fetched and clichéd revelations. The only thing that bugged me a little was the dragging ending, which rubbed me the wrong way. It was still tragic, but I wished Rosie’s character could be more rational as a talented, investigative true crime author. That's why I deducted one star from my rating, even though I fell in love with the gothic atmosphere and the meeting of occult vibes with paranormal elements. I'm giving it four stars, and I have to admit my heartfelt gratitude to dear Lisa Unger for sending me a physical and signed copy of her new creation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm looking forward to reading her next works in the near future.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0
59,Where Sleeping Girls Lie,Mystery,"It’s like I keep stumbling into a dark room, searching for the switch to make things bright again. To make me remember. But the switch isn’t there.

After being home-schooled all her life and feeling like a magnet for misfortune, she’s not sure what will happen.

Or for people to think she had something to do with it.With rumors swirling around her, Sade catches the attention of the most popular girls in school – collectively known as the ‘Unholy Trinity’ – and they bring her into their fold. Between learning more about them - especially Persephone, who Sade finds herself drawn to - playing catch-up in class, and trying to figure out what happened to Elizabeth, Sade has a lot on her plate.

60,Good Half Gone,Thriller,"With no evidence to go on but a few scattered memories, the case quickly goes cold.Now an adult, Iris wants one thing—proof. And if the police still won’t help, she’ll just have to find it her own way; by interning at the isolated Shoal Island Hospital for the criminally insane, where secrets lurk in the shadows and are kept under lock and key. But Iris soon realizes that something even more sinister is simmering beneath the surface of the Shoal, and that the patients aren’t the only ones being observed…","What in the actual hell? I must first tell you that this whole book plays out with little suspense until the last 20% of the book. The beginning had a fantastic start, only to take a few left turns. Okay…..The story starts where Iris Walsh is on a call with 911. She just witnessed her twin sister’s kidnapping right in front of her eyes. Years later she is traumatized from the events that unfolded that night. She just can’t get over the disappearance of her twin sister, Piper. What happened to Piper and is she still alive? Determined to do her own investigating, and with years of school behind her, she takes an internship at a state hospital on an island. Why? The man she believes is responsible for Piper’s disappearance and or possible murder has been sentenced there. Iris is so obsessed for answers that she will stop at NOTHING to get them. Sounds juicy, right? I was hopeful too….. only to be taken down a long distracting road. This story starts bringing in other plot lines that really didn’t do much for the story. Yes, we learn Iris and Piper had a shitty drug fueled mother….. life wasn’t fair. Then we take a tour of some possible romance that I really couldn’t care less about. Then we have the strong willed grandmother who has raised these girls, only to find out Gran is hanging on a thread with her health. Finally, that ENDING TWIST…. Pfffffff. What? Nope, doesn’t work for me, sorry folks. 😳😳😳I wanted suspense and a brain teaser and that just wasn’t in the cards. After The Wives and this one, Fisher just isn’t for me. However, many people love her and maybe so will you. I’d like to thank Harlequin Trade Publishing, NetGalley, and Tarryn Fisher an ARC. All opinions are my own.

62,The Princess of Las Vegas,Mystery,"A Princess Diana impersonator and her estranged sister find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of money and murder in this twisting tale of organized crime, cryptocurrency, and family secrets on the Las Vegas strip.Crissy Dowling has created a world that suits her perfectly. She passes her days by the pool in a private cabana, she splurges on ice cream but never gains an ounce, and each evening she transforms into a Princess, performing her musical cabaret inspired by the life of the late Diana Spencer. Some might find her strange or even delusional, an American speaking with a British accent, hair feathered into a style thirty years old, living and working in a casino that has become a dated trash heap. On top of that, Crissy’s daily diet of Adderall and Valium leaves her more than a little tipsy, her Senator boyfriend has gone back to his wife, and her entire career rests on resembling a dead woman. And yet, fans see her for the gifted chameleon she is, showering her with gifts, letters, and standing ovations night after night. But when Crissy’s sister, Betsy, arrives in town with a new boyfriend and a teenage daughter, and when Richie Morley, the owner of the Buckingham Palace Casino, is savagely murdered, Crissy’s carefully constructed kingdom comes crashing down all around her. A riveting tale of identity, obsession, fintech, and high-tech mobsters, The Princess of Las Vegas is an addictive, wildly original thriller from one of our most extraordinary storytellers.","This had a very strong start that quickly became bogged down by a dumb as a box of rocks MC, and an unrealistic foster child who is a brilliant child prodigy. The crypto currency and mobster side plots bored me to tears. The direction the book would take was telegraphed from the beginning: A Princess Di look-alike who has a residency in Las Vegas? A sister who looks just like her, who gets involved in a shady cryptocurrency deal? Predictable, but the ending was so convoluted my eyes glazed over. This was a buddy read with Marialyce, and sadly, not one we’d recommend.",2.0
63,The Unquiet Bones,Thriller,"When human bones are found beneath an old chapel in the woods, evidence suggests the remains could be linked to the decades-old case of missing teen Annalise Jansen.Homicide detective Jane Munro—pregnant and acutely attuned to the preciousness of life—hopes the grim discovery will finally bring closure to the girl’s family. But for a group of Annalise’s old friends, once dubbed the Shoreview Six by the media, it threatens to expose a terrible pledge made on an autumn night forty-seven years ago.The friends are now highly respected, affluent members of their communities, and none of them ever expected the dark chapter in their past to resurface. But as Jane and forensic anthropologist Dr. Ella Quinn peel back the layers of secrets, the group begins to fracture. Will one cave? Will they turn on each other?The investigation takes a sharp turn when Jane discovers a second body—that of the boy long blamed for Annalise’s disappearance. As the bones tell their story, the group learns just how far each will go to guard their own truth.","Too Many Characters3.5 stars “Our lives are written into our bones.”The Unquiet Bones  is a mystery about the remains of a body found buried under a chapel at a ski resort connected to a 15-year-old girl who went missing 47 years ago.47 years ago, Annilese Jansen went missing after attending a party. Her immediate friends are thrown into the spotlight, and the media dubs them the Shoreview Six.In the present, bones are recovered under a chapel in the woods. Sergeant Jane Munro is assigned the case. Jane, who is 6 months pregnant, is also going through a trauma as her fiance went missing 6 months ago.MANY POVs are included , including all 6 members of the Shoreview Six: Rocco, Jill, Cara, Bob, Mary, and Claude. In addition, there is Jane’s POV, Annilese’s sister, a journalist, and about three to four others. Some POVs are shared late in the game, while others are steady throughout. Because there are so many characters, it is hard to connect, as their POVs are limited. Some only share one chapter, but Jane, Angela, and various members of the Shoreview Six dominate. I had trouble keeping track of who was who, and the many characters overcomplicated the simple plot. The timeline alternates between the present and 1976. In addition to the mystery of the bones and Annalise’s disappearance, there is also the mystery of another high school student who disappeared at the same time as Annalise. The mystery behind Jane’s missing fiance isn't resolved, and I can see her showing up in another book.The mystery is intriguing, but the pacing is slow. I was a little bored in the beginning due to the number of characters, and it takes time for the plot to move, but the pace eventually builds, as does the tension. The final chapters and reveal are difficult and uncomfortable to read and made me sick to my stomach (see the TW below). The ending is impactful and left me a little shaken. Overall, this book does come together, but it would have made more of an impact with fewer characters and more development.

64,Baby X,Science Fiction,"When any biological matter can be used to create life, stolen celebrity DNA sells to the highest bidder–or the craziest stalker–in this propulsive thriller.With a vivid imagining of the future, Gattaca meets The Ones in Kira Peikoff’s Baby X .In the near-future United States, where advanced technology can create egg or sperm from any person’s cells, celebrities face the alarming potential of meeting biological children they never conceived. Famous singer Trace Thorne is tired of being targeted by the Vault, a black market site devoted to stealing DNA. Sick of paying ransom money for his own cell matter, he hires bio-security guard Ember Ryan to ensure his biological safety.  Ember will do anything she can to protect her clients. She knows all the Vault’s tricks–discarded tissues, used straws, lipstick tubes–and has prevented countless DNA thefts. Working for Thorne, her focus becomes split when she begins to fall for him, but she knows she hasn’t let anything slip–love or not, his DNA is safe. But then she and Thorne are confronted by a pregnant woman, Quinn, who claims that Thorne is the father of her baby, and all bets are off.   Brilliantly plotted and terrifyingly prescient, Baby X is an unpredictable and relentless speculative thriller perfect for fans of Blake Crouch.","Check out all my reviews on: 
The Book Review Crew Blog
3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
65,The Mystery Writer,Mystery,"A literary thriller about an aspiring writer who meets and falls in love with her literary idol—only to find him murdered the day after she gave him her manuscript to read. There's nothing easier to dismiss than a conspiracy theory—until it turns out to be trueWhen Theodosia Benton abandons her career path as an attorney and shows up on her brother's doorstep with two suitcases and an unfinished novel, she expects to face a few challenges. Will her brother support her ambition or send her back to finish her degree? What will her parents say when they learn of her decision? Does she even have what it takes to be a successful writer?What Theo never expects is to be drawn into a hidden literary world in which identity is something that can be lost and remade for the sake of an audience. When her mentor, a highly successful author, is brutally murdered, Theo wants the killer to be found and justice to be served. Then the police begin looking at her brother, Gus, as their prime suspect, and Theo does the unthinkable in order to protect him. But the writer has left a trail, a thread out of the labyrinth in the form of a story. Gus finds that thread and follows it, and in his attempt to save his sister he inadvertently threatens the foundations of the labyrinth itself. To protect the carefully constructed narrative, Theo Benton, and everyone looking for her, will have to die.","I have a habit of automatically requesting books from authors that I have enjoyed before-often without even reading the premise! Next year, I will have to be more discerning, and start reading the synopsis to determine if the particular story is REALLY a fit for me, despite past positive experiences with the author!Had I done so in this case, (and the synopsis really shares too much!) I wouldn’t have requested this book, as I know that I rarely enjoy a story about conspiracy theories or the people who believe in them. But, that wasn’t the only issue I had with this book…**Theo Benton has left the University she has been attending, convinced that her career path as an attorney is the wrong path for her, and shown up on her brother's doorstep in Kansas with two suitcases and an unfinished novel.She decides to finish her book at cafe/bar called “Benders”, which happens to already have a highly successful “writer in residence”, Dan Murdoch, who quickly becomes her mentor-until he is brutally murdered.Could his senseless death have anything to do with the Conspiracy Theories he has been researching?Was he involved or is there another agenda at work? Theo is determined to find out.Unfortunately, despite her good intentions, I could not connect with Theo, who comes across as a weepy, naive “damsel in distress” who needs continual rescuing from her brother Gus, and his friend and associate, Mac, whose family are “Doomsday Preppers”.Another issue-as written, you would believe that all Americans run around armed with a gun.In addition, despite 400 pages, the last 30% uses SEVERAL abrupt time jumps, to move the story to its denouement, making the ending feel extremely rushed. (and over the top)“After She Wrote Him” earned 4 stars from me, and “The Woman in the Library” earned 5 stars and a place on my FAVORITE READS shelf for 2022, so I am sure this is a one off and I am still looking forward to seeing what Sulari Gentill pens next.

66,The Angel of Indian Lake,Horror,"Since then, her reputation, and everything around Indian Lake, has changed dramatically. There’s a lot of unfinished business in Proofrock, from serial killer cultists to the rich trying to buy Western authenticity. But there’s one aspect of the savage history of Proofrock, Idaho, no one’s got the mettle to confront – no one except a final girl, making her last stand, this time for everything.New York Times bestselling author Stephen Graham Jones has crafted an epic horror trilogy of generational trauma and stolen hope. It’s the story of the American West written in blood. And it’s the story of one girl who doesn’t know how to give up.","The Angel of Indian Lake is the final book in the Indian Lake Trilogy. It's also my most anticipated release of 2024.I finished this a week ago and have been sitting with my thoughts ever since. I find myself thinking of the story at random times during the day, and trying to decide how I would explain my overall experience with this trilogy.I really haven't come up with anything that I think serves it justice. At this point, I've come to terms with the fact that this is just one of those 5-star reads that I may never end up writing a full, thoughtful, and analytical review for.It simply is what it is. I love this series with my whole heart. It's special to me, because in a way, I feel like this series validates my passion for the crazily nuanced genre of Horror.Stephen Graham Jones is such a talented storyteller. His nostalgic, yet edgy-style, brings a distinct voice to his stories, while also bringing heart and emotion. We swoon.While I recognize this trilogy won't be for everyone, for the people it is for, for the people it resonates with, it's truly a gift. My heart hurts that it's over. Is this really the last time I'm going to spend with these characters I love?I know I can read it again and again, as I do with my favorite King books, but still, I'm going to miss them nevertheless. SGJ is clearly a life-long Horror lover, a student of the genre, and someone that can tell one hell of a story.I'd love to hang out with him around a campfire...I highly recommend this series to Horror Readers. Particularly to Horror Readers who have been turning to the genre their whole life for comfort and to face fears. Perhaps you'll see a little of yourself in here too.Also, coincidentally, I did happen to rewatch Scream III while reading this and loved coming upon Randy's rules for Slasher Trilogies, which definitely could be applied here. It was great to hear those again from him whilst reading this. So perfect. We love making beautiful Horror connections!!Thank you so much to the publisher, Saga Press, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I already can't wait to read this one again!",5.0
67,Lilith,Thriller,"From the New York Times and internationally bestselling author of I Am Not Who You Think I Am—a New York Times Thriller of the Year—comes Lilith, an incendiary powerhouse of a novel that strikes straight at the wounded heart of America.After her son Lydan suffers traumatic injuries in a school shooting, single mom Elisabeth Ross grows enraged at men in power. If they won’t do anything to help end this epidemic of violence, she will. Believing it’s her destiny, she sets out to awaken the world to the cowards these men are and commits her own shocking act of violence. Going by the name Lilith—the first wife of Adam who fled Eden rather than serve a man—she posts a video of her crime that reverberates throughout society.Praised by some, demonized by others, and sought by the FBI and vigilantes alike, Elisabeth must keep her identity a secret as she tries to care for her son.As events take startling twists, Elisabeth begins to question her act of violence and the very roots and mythology of violence itself. Was her act justified or has she become the monster that the original Lilith was accused of being?When the FBI draws closer, and Lydan starts to display odd, terrifying behavior, Elisabeth plots to avoid capture and keep her son safe, fearing she’ll never escape what she’s done without losing her son forever. Written with Rickstad’s singular command of language, human insight, and unnerving suspense, Lilith is a tale of our times. Tragic and profound, it echoes in the mind and lingers in the blood.","Elizabeth’s son, Lydon, doesn’t want to go to school today. He says he has an ‘icky’ feeling and asks his mum if he can please stay at home? She’s sympathetic and would like nothing more than to stay at home with her beloved boy, but he’s not ill, and as a teacher at his school it’s not a request she can sanction. It proves to be a seminal moment. What transpires that day will change everything - on this day, a man with a gun will enter the school.Elizabeth will survive the events that transpire, but it will change her. Later, she watches the strutting owner of a gun shop announce his intention to run for president, as he also declares that more guns, not less, is the answer to the ongoing succession of mass killings. She knows that someone needs to do something about this idea about this man. Could that somebody be her? Adopting the name Lilith – the moniker attributed to the woman theorised to be the first wife of Adam and supposedly the primordial she-devil – she decides she will concoct and execute a plan of her own.I recently read Bloodbath Nation, Paul Auster’s reflection on America’s relationship with guns. In this memoir/essay, the esteemed writer says that the country has done nothing to address the problems that arise from this irrational love affair, one that is unique to the United States amongst developed nations. It’s a powerful and totally scary piece, as he talks readers through his own experience with guns and lists details of many mass murders across the country. In his conclusion, he concedes that the current impasse between the anti-gun and pro-gun proclaimers will not be resolved any time soon. This novel picks up a different angle to this phenomenon: that just about every mass killing is born from the actions of a man. So perhaps it’s about time women did something about it.This is a thrilling told story. It's short but totally absorbing. I raced through it in a few sessions, never quite knowing how events would play out or what fate awaited our anti-hero. The suspense is maintained throughout, right up to a gripping finish. I liked the way it was set out, too, in an unusual way with sometimes only a few words on a page. It definitely worked for me. I’d enjoyed the author’s previous novel I Am Not Who You Think I Am and this story definitely picks Rickstad out as a writer I’ll be looking out for in the future.My thanks to Blackstone Publishing for providing a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5.0
68,The Best Way to Bury Your Husband,Mystery,"A dark comedy about four women coming together to heal the damage their husbands have done––and hide their bodies once they’ve killed themWhen Sally kills her husband with a cast-iron skillet, she’s more fearful of losing her kids than of disposing of a fresh corpse. That just wouldn’t be fair—not after twenty years of marriage to a truly terrible man. But Sally isn’t the only woman in town reaching the brink. Soon, Sally finds herself leading an extremely unusual self-help group, and among them there are four bodies to hide. Can they all figure out the perfect way to bury their husbands . . . and get away with it?First to join is former nurse, Ruth, who met her husband as a single mom. Now her son is grown and her husband’s violence builds by the day until an attack on the stairs leads to a fatal accident—for him. A few doors down, Samira’s last straw comes when she discovers her husband is planning a campaign of violence against her eldest daughter, who has just come out. Janey, Sally’s best friend, has just had her first child at forty-two. Sleep-deprived Janey needs a hero to slay the monster in the fairy tales she whispers to her daughter each night . . . and as her husband’s violence escalates, it might just be her.Together, fueled by righteous anger but tempered by a moral core, the four women must help each other work out a plan to get rid of their husbands for good. Along the way, Sally, Ruth, Samira and Janey rediscover old joys and embark on new passions in work, education, and life. Friendship and laughter really are the best medicine—and so is getting away with murder.","I think my husband might be a little concerned about how much I loved this book. And, granted, if you ever need to get rid of an inconvenient body, this book has lots of helpful ideas (a desiccation parcel, who knew?!) to assist you in taking care of your problem. Although, really, I exaggerate – my husband is not at all worried about me reading this book because, well, he's not an abusive monster, but also because he already thinks I tried to kill him once and he didn't seem all that bothered. No, really.Let me digress for a moment here. Shortly after we were married, my husband had a dream that I tried to suffocate him while he was sleeping, which he apparently thought really happened. Now, I know what you're thinking the story is here – he immediately woke up, got angry, and I had to convince him that I wasn't actually a murderess. Nope. He didn't say anything about it to me at all, for, like, six months. It only came up one day because he was giving me examples of how I “get grumpy” when I'm tired (apparently I was trying to kill him because he was snoring too loudly – tempting, I'll admit). I assured him that no such thing had occurred. He doubled down. I mean, this is the guy who once, when our son was very little, woke up from a dead sleep, grabbed our very surprised dog off of my lap, plopped her on his chest, and tried to shush her to sleep because he thought it was the baby. This is the level of cognizance he has in the middle of the night. But, sure, I tried to suffocate him. This disturbed me a wee bit, because not only was he (quite nonchalantly) accusing me of attempted murder, but also because what kind of weirdo thinks that their spouse tried to kill them in their sleep and then goes “Oh, well!” and then just goes on about their business without a care in the world? For six months?! These days he claims not to remember his supposed attempted murder or the argument that ensued months later, so apparently he wasn't too traumatized by his imaginary ordeal and has no real fear of me and my murdering ways. I'm pretty sure I could come home tomorrow with a shovel, some lime, and a body bag and he still wouldn't think twice about it, except maybe to bring it up months later in an argument about unnecessary spending. So, yeah.Ahem. Oh, right, the book.This novel is absolutely amazing, although not exactly what I expected. I thought it would be more of a dark humor type of thing, and there definitely is some of that. But, at its heart, it's really a story of friendship, hope, and second chances, and it's both hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time. Of course, there are parts that aren't so fun to read – this is a book about domestic violence, after all. And the women in this book are certainly battered and abused.Is the premise of this book rather absurd? Well, yes. Obviously the chances of four women in the same town murdering their abusive husbands in the same week and then randomly finding each other is very, very low on the probability scale. But I think the author did an excellent job of bringing awareness to the problem of domestic violence, particularly the unique issues that arose during the COVID-19 lockdown, and you kind of just have to suspend your disbelief on some of the rest of it.The characters in this novel are fantastic. Edwina and her snooping was brilliant, and her part in the ending was laugh-out-loud funny. Sally was a likable narrator, and I feel that her backstory did a great job of explaining why abused women don't “just leave him.” I also appreciated the diversity of the characters, which Casale mentions in the afterword was intentional to bring awareness to the fact that domestic abuse occurs across the cultural spectrum. There isn't a mystery in this book per se, other than “will they get away with it?” But there are lots of ridiculous hijinks that occur while the Lockdown Ladies' Burial Club tries to figure out the answer to that question, and it's a delightful ride. Final rating: An enthusiastic 5 stars. This book is one of the highlights of my 2023 reads.Many thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Books for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0
69,Finding Sophie,Thriller,"How far will they go to find the truth?Someone is guilty.For the last seventeen years, Harry and Zara King’s lives have revolved around their only daughter, Sophie. One day, Sophie leaves the house and doesn’t come home. Six weeks later, the police are no closer to finding her than when they started. Harry and Zara have questioned everyone who has ever had any connection to Sophie, to no avail. Except there’s one house on their block—number 210, across the street—whose occupant refuses to break his silence.Someone knows what happened.As the question mark over number 210 devolves into obsession, Harry and Zara are forced to examine their own lives. They realize they have grown apart, suffering in separate spheres of grief. And as they try to find their way back to each other, they must face the truth about their daughter: who she was, how she changed, and why she disappeared.Someone will pay.Told in the alternating perspectives of Harry and Zara, and in a dual timeline between the weeks after Sophie’s disappearance and a year later in the middle of a murder trial, Imran Mahmood’s taut yet profoundly moving novel explores how differently grief can be experienced even when shared by parents—and how hope triumphs when it springs from the kind of love that knows no bounds.","Sophie has disappeared and her parents are worried because they can't find her anywhere. The police aren't helping them at all. They can't seem to be able to find any clues. So Henry and Zara start to search for her themselves. Their neighbor in number 210, who lives across the street from them is very suspicious. He won't answer his door and he won't answer any questions. He remains silent. Sophie's parents are desperate to find their missing daughter. How far will they go to find their daughter? Someone knows what happened to Sophie. Sophie was hiding some dark secrets before she disappeared.Her parents are accused of murder I really enjoyed this book. It did have a slow burn to it in the beginning but then the suspense slowly builds and it becomes a thrilling wild ride. This is every parents nightmare. I loved the second half more than the first half. This is a legal thriller then turns into a thriller with lots of action. It had everything that I love in a thriller. This one is very dark and disturbing. I thought all the characters were very well done. The parents went through so much. My heart ached for them. It just broke my heart. OMG! That ending was so good. It went one way, then took a different direction that I wasn't expecting. I want to thank Bantam and Netgalley for the copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4.0
70,The Housemaid,Thriller,"“Welcome to the family,” Nina Winchester says as I shake her elegant, manicured hand. I smile politely, gazing around the marble hallway.

How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day.

Anyone who loves The Woman in the Window, The Wife Between Us and The Girl on the Train won’t be able to put this down!","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖Thank you Bookouture and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2.0
71,The Teacher,Thriller,"Lesson #1: Trust no one.Eve has a good life. She wakes up each day, kisses her husband Nate, and heads off to teach math at the local high school. All is as it should be. Except…Last year, Caseham High was rocked by a scandal involving a student-teacher affair, with one student, Addie, at its center. But Eve knows there is far more to these ugly rumors than meets the eye.Addie can’t be trusted. She lies. She hurts people. She destroys lives. At least, that’s what everyone says.But nobody knows the real Addie. Nobody knows the secrets that could destroy her. And Addie will do anything to keep it quiet…","I've enjoyed previous books by McFadden (Never Lie, The Inmate, The Locked Door) -- so, despite REALLY disliking several of her recent books (The Housemaid's Secret, The Coworker, Ward D) -- I still really wanted to read THE TEACHER. This one felt more like her earlier books in a way I enjoyed -- mainly that it was super fast-paced and full of characters to dislike, so despite some serious misgivings along the way, I still had it clicking along at a pleasantly-surprising two or three stars in my head, but then the epilogue happened. I always expect a McTwist or twelve, and of course won't write a spoiler here (( BUT FEEL FREE TO SCROLL DOWN IF YOU WANT THEM )), but that last ""twist"" was completely fucking unacceptable on many levels.* thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for the NetGalley review copy.

Who is digging? Who is dead? Fun start! Then we flash back to three months earlier where we meet Eve Bennett, who is putting on a pair of black JIMMY CHOO stiletto pumps to go to her job teaching high school math (lol) and thinking about how hot her husband Nate is compared to her... and also how much she hates him because they never fuck anymore. Nate also teaches at the high school - English - and is the hottest hottie hot hot teacher at the school, based on a list made by the senior girls that another faculty member knew about and then shared with Eve? The next chapter is from Addie's perspective. She's a junior, and everyone at school hates her because last year there were rumors she had a relationship with her math teacher, Arthur Tuttle (who is decidedly NOT a hottie hot hot teacher as he evidently resembles Santa?), while he was tutoring her and ""ruined his life"". Eve doesn't like Addie because Arthur is the nicest man ever and could *never* do such a terrible thing. Because that's 100% how the world works. Men who seem nice could never, ever be predators. Duh. Addie gets bullied a bunch by a girl named Kenzie Montgomery - a popular cheerleader who is also (supposedly, but as it turns out way later is NOT) dating Addie's old BFF, Hudson Jankowski. Hudson was Addie's only friend for years - they both had drunk dads and not much money - but then Hudson got swole and started playing football and is now super popular.Anyway, Eve is PISSED because Addie the Santa Destroyer is in her math class and she's going to have to teach her even though she has a ""terrible feeling about this girl."" She drowns her sorrows by going to a shoe store at the mall and thinking about stealing some LOUBOUTINS because it wouldn't be a FMcF book without the word LOUBOUTINS in it at least once, but then she doesn't steal the LOUBOUTINS and goes home and tries to bone Hot Nate, but he's not into it, so they eat some pasta instead. Everyone in this book eats A LOT of pasta.Addie hates math and is not happy to be in mean Eve's class, but she's super jazzed because she's also in Hot Nate's English class and Hot Nate loves poetry and Addie writes poetry and he also writes poetry and he loves Edgar Allan Poe and she also loves Edgar Allan Poe and OMG!!!!!!!!! Addie writes a poem and Hot Nate LOVES it and wants to see her after class because her poem is so amazing and a lyrical masterpiece and should be published. He recruits her for the high school poetry magazine (called REFLECTIONS, dear lord), and he makes a lot of eye contact with his chocolate-bar-brown eyes. Later that day, Eve puts on her MANOLO BLAHNIK boots and ditches Hot Nate to go to a shoe store. It is very important to know that Eve really, REALLY likes shoes. Like so much. She tries on the same LOUBOUTINS she tried on at the mall and then Jay the hot shoe salesman feels her up and they go fuck in the storeroom among the piles of shoes. As it turns out, our girl Eve has been making love (vomit) with the shoe salesman once a week for the past four months and wishes she could run away with him. Oh, Eve. Addie and Hot Nate are at a Reflections meeting and he tells her he's entering her poem in a state competition because she is ""a master of this craft, even at sixteen"" and is so amazing. Addie says she's not amazing at math and Hot Nate asks if his wife is giving Addie a hard time and then says a bunch of shit about how he was dumb at math too and his wife is too logical and not a dreamer like they are... and now Addie is officially being groomed! Then it's Eve's thirtieth birthday and she puts on her LOUIS VUITTON pumps and tries to bone Hot Nate before work, but he's not into it again. Uh oh. Later that night they go out to dinner at a (yep) pasta restaurant and have a terrible time. Nate parks really far away from the entrance to the restaurant which is a dick move because she's still wearing those LOUIS VUITTON pumps with a four-inch heel. Eve thinks she should try to connect more with Hot Nate and let him read his poems to her in a park again like he used to (all I can think about are the Kens playing guitar at the Barbies for four hours on the beach), even though she doesn't even like poetry and would rather do quadratic equations because she likes MATH, goddammit. Hot Nate gets flirted with by the waitress and then spots Addie at the restaurant and talks about Addie's lyrical mind and their mutual love of Edgar Allan Poe a bunch to his wife. Happy B-day, Eve! Addie notices Hot Nate is eating ravioli and ponders his filling selection and wishes she was eating dinner with him so he could share his thoughts about EAP poems with her (again with the Kens on the beach). Addie and Hot Nate run into each other by the pasta restaurant bathroom (sex-ay!) and she worries that someone will see them talking and he'll end up ruined like Santa Tuttle. She tells him about her terrible day being bullied, so he gives her a special homework assignment to write an angry revenge letter to her bully and Addie thinks about what a bitch Eve is for making Hot Nate so unhappy. After the terrible birthday meal, Eve finds a pair of glossy red SAM EDELMAN sling pumps on her porch from Jay. Awww. Sex shoes!Addie's locker gets filled with shaving cream by mean Kenzie, and during the cleanup -- in the first McTwist -- reveals that Hudson helped her kill her father. DUN DUN DUNNNNN! Her dad was a drunk, abusive asshole and they pushed him down the stairs and pretended they were at Hudson's house studying the whole time. After the murder Hudson completely stopped talking to her, but he still helps her clean her locker because he is such a nice guy.Then Hot Nate comes along and helps clean up the last bit of locker shaving cream and offers Addie a ride home from school in his Honda Accord. Addie is digging the ride because the car is cleaner than her mom's and smells like him, and he tells her about the difficulty he experienced being a poetry-writing sixteen-year-old boy and recites the first poem he ever wrote (for his mom, at age six, which Jesus H DOES NOT COUNT AS A POEM), and she wishes they would kiss and thinks ""there's something poetic about the name Nathaniel"" (aaaand I am officially dead because my husband is named Nathaniel and I can't stop laughing even though this entire situation is gross AF). ANYWAY, Eve fucks Jay again. Addie cheats on a math midterm and gets busted. Eve wears her MANOLO BLAHNIKS to school. Hot Nate takes Eve to the bone zone after school so she doesn't rat Addie out to the principal for cheating on the math test. Addie steals Kenzie's keys, lets herself into her house, and breaks a ceramic bird. We are now 47% through this goddamn book.Hot Nate and Addie talk again after a Reflections meeting, and he lets her know that he got her out of trouble with his mean wife. Addie hugs Hot Nate to say thank you, ""But then something firm pokes me in the leg. Like a roll of toilet paper."" Um. I have read more than my fair share of sex business in books and have never in my life heard a boner compared to a roll of toilet paper. I have a lot of questions. Hot Nate apologizes to Addie for the toilet roll in his pants and then immediately launches into complaining about how his wife sucks and how he feels like he's finally connected to someone for the first time in his life. Addie leaves but can't stop thinking about that firm toilet paper pants roll (GIRL, RUN!) and comes back. Hot Nate says he's trying so hard to resist her but he just can't and then they go into the abandoned photography darkroom and make out a bunch. Hot Nate drives Addie home afterwards and tells her she's his soulmate. Then he goes home and tries to bone zone Eve but she turns him down, so now his toilet roll is blue and he is mad.Addie writes a terrible poem about her love for Hot Nate. Then Hot Nate reads her a terrible poem that he wrote. And now I can no longer call him Hot Nate as a joke because he's officially a fucking rapist.Addie and Sexual Predator Nate have a lot of predatory sex in the darkroom. SP Nate continues with the soulmate talk to keep Addie hooked even though ""it doesn't last long, and Nathaniel says that's normal when you like somebody as much as he likes me."" AAAAAAAGH. Addie starts thinking about how much better everything would be if Eve was not around anymore.Then Addie gets her lunch dumped on the ground by Kenzie and Kenzie sees a copy of the poem SP Nate wrote. Eve is mean and won't let Addie eat a sandwich during class, so Addie hates her even more. Eve and SP Nate have a bad dinner party with their friends. Eve spots Addie lurking in the bushes outside of their house and tells SP Nate about it. Eve then tells the principal and Addie gets hauled into the office. SP Nate tells her to ""deny everything"" so she lies and says she wasn't there, but since she also got busted lurking outside of Santa Tuttle's house no one believes her. SP Nate starts ghosting Addie so she goes to see him in his classroom during lunch. They kiss AND EVE SEES THEM and takes a picture. This is the part of the book where Eve talks a bunch about how none of this is Addie's fault and that she is a child and that SP Nate is a fucking creep who took advantage of her vulnerability and that it was his responsibility to keep this from happening because he is an adult. Then goes on to say the age of consent is sixteen, so he's technically NOT a rapist. Keep all of this in mind when we get to the fucking epilogue.Eve then meets up with her fuckboy shoe salesman Jay and tells him everything. They decide she needs to leave Nate and also decide not to tell the principal. Then Eve gets wasted, confronts Nate, and kicks him out. He yells at her a bunch about shoes and leaves. He texts Addie and says he wishes Eve was dead. Addie concurs and eats a bunch of ice cream. Eve also eats a bunch of ice cream and passes out on the couch. She wakes up to a loud crash and worries someone is breaking in to steal her LOUBOUTINS because that is rational and because LOUBOUTINS haven't been mentioned for a few chapters.omfg we're almost at the end. buckle up.The crashing sound was Addie knocking a frying pan off of the stove. Eve and Addie confront each other and Eve says a bunch of reasonable things about SP Nate being a manipulative predator and how his feelings for a teenager are not normal and Addie flips the fuck out and hits Eve in the head with the frying pan. Three times. She calls SP Nate using Eve's phone and SP Nate comes over. Eve wakes up while Addie is getting a sheet to wrap her corpse in and SP Nate strangles her. Addie notices that Eve's body is in a different location and now she has big finger-shaped bruises on her neck, but SP Nate convinces her to help put Eve's body in the trunk and they drive her body to an abandoned pumpkin patch. We learn that SP Nate's biggest fears are death and snakes. They start digging a hole, but then SP Nate lies about getting Eve's purse from the car and abandons Addie and goes home to bed. Addie finishes burying Eve and messages Hudson to come pick her up from the middle of nowhere. Now SP Nate is at home and weird shit keeps happening. He finds shoes in the shower and thinks about The Raven a bunch and eventually calls the police to report Eve missing. He then finds more shoes in strange places - some covered in dirt, some with smashed pumpkin on them, and then there's a bird in his kitchen so he thinks about The Raven some more. FFS. The police visit Addie and question her a little and seem to think she killed Eve because SP Nate shows them her rage letter about Kenzie. Then Kenzie shows up at Addie's house and apologizes for being such a huge bitch and tells Addie SHE was in a relationship with SP Nate when she was FOURTEEN and knows Addie is also being abused because SP Nate gave them both the same shitty poem (which she saw in the lunchroom) and they had to break up when Addie had her Santa Tuttle scandal so that's why she hates Addie so much. The girls then go to the police station and tell them everything - and the police actually believe them, which feels like a fucking miracle.SP Nate is home and finds a pumpkin with a bird inside in his kitchen and freaks out because THE RAVEN. The police are on their way so he goes to the pumpkin patch to check Eve’s grave and make sure she's really dead. Uh-oh... The grave is empty! Eve is alive! Turns out she unburied herself and called Jay to come get her. Jay takes her to the sexy shoe store and gives her some sensible winter non-fuck boots and hides her in his tool shed for a few days. They start pranking SP Nate with the shoes and pumpkins and birds and whatnot and when he goes to the grave they are waiting and hit him with a rock and chuck him in the hole and bury him alive. While digging, Eve remembers the poem SP Nate wrote her when she was fifteen and he was her teacher - and (McTwist!) it’s the same poem he gave Addie and Kenzie so I guess we’re all happy SP Nate is going to be dead in the pumpkin patch because he's a Serial SP with an unstoppable toilet roll. Now we’re (FINALLY) in the epilogue. The police stop investigating because Eve isn’t actually dead and they assume SP Nate just left town without a trace. Eve quits her job and also moves away. Hudson and Addie are friends again and Kenzie has stopped bullying Addie and no one is being sexually abused anymore, so I guess everyone is fine?And now for the final McTwist: IT TURNS OUT HUDSON JANKOWSKI IS THE JAY EVE WAS FUCKING IN THE SHOE STORE so she’s also a sexual predator despite her earlier CORRECT yelling at SP Nate about it being wrong to - you know - have sex with minors. For fuck’s sake. Also - from a strictly logistical standpoint… how did Hudson/Jay manage to drive to the middle of nowhere and back twice in one night to pick up both Addie and Eve? And why is he hanging out with Addie even though she tried to kill Eve? And he already knows she killed her dad? And how did he and Eve catch all of the birds? And get one to stay in a pumpkin? The end.EDITED 2/22/24 TO ADD/CLARIFY : Jay was not married. The baby was his little brother. The ""her""/woman on the phone was Jay/Hudson's mom. And according to FMcF herself... (thanks to a commenter asking FMcF directly) -- EVE KNEW JAY/HUDSON WAS A STUDENT AT HER SCHOOL. Aaaaaaaaaagh barf blech ewwww fuuuuuuck.",1.0
72,Never Lie,Thriller,"Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are searching for the house of their dreams.But when they visit the remote manor that once belonged to Dr. Adrienne Hale, a renowned psychiatrist who vanished without a trace four years earlier, a violent winter storm traps them at the estate… with no chance of escape until the blizzard comes to an end.In search of a book to keep her entertained until the snow abates, Tricia happens upon a secret room. One that contains audio transcripts from every single patient Dr. Hale has ever interviewed. As Tricia listens to the cassette tapes, she learns about the terrifying chain of events leading up to Dr. Hale’s mysterious disappearance.Tricia plays the tapes one by one, late into the night. With each one, another shocking piece of the puzzle falls into place, and Dr. Adrienne Hale’s web of lies slowly unravels.And then Tricia reaches the final cassette.The one that reveals the entire horrifying truth.","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖 I read this as part of a group buddy read on Instagram which is why I didn't yeet it into outer space.  One sentence review:  L M F A O you're joking  SYNOPSIS Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are snowed in during their viewing at the creepy, dusty, secluded mcmansion once owned by Dr. Adrienne Hale, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace four years ago. When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor's disappearance.  MY OPINION BUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE. Where to start, where to start? Ok let's do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here's an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:  But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere. I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere. Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here's a sample: I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him? The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming. Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won't reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:  I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.  Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they're gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.  SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM At first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan's BMW (it's not a car, it's a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she's okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman's RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty. Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she's shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn't one.Tricia's behaviour doesn't even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog's bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would've made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together. Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I'm going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I've read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest. Adding her to my avoid list lol. PROS AND CONS Pros: funny rants with the buddy readers, she did have some good red herrings in there tbh Cons: ... did I stutter? 😂___Check out my YouTube",1.0

Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

75,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
76,The Inmate,Thriller,"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates. But none of the staff at the prison knows Brooke has already broken the rules. Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary's most notorious and dangerous inmates. And they certainly don't know that Shane was Brooke's high school sweetheart―the star quarterback who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of grisly murders. Or that Brooke's testimony was what put him there. But Shane knows. And he will never forget.","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0

78,The Coworker,Thriller,"Two women. An office filled with secrets. One terrible crime that can't be taken backDawn Schiff is strange. At least, everyone thinks so at Vixed, the nutritional supplement company where Dawn works as an accountant. She never says the right thing. She has no friends. And she is always at her desk at precisely 8:45 a.m.So when Dawn doesn't show up to the office one morning, her coworker Natalie Farrell—beautiful, popular, top sales rep five years running—is surprised. Then she receives an unsettling, anonymous phone call that changes everything…It turns out Dawn wasn't just an awkward outsider—she was being targeted by someone close. And now Natalie is irrevocably tied to Dawn as she finds herself caught in a twisted game of cat and mouse that leaves her wondering: who's the real victim?<But one thing is incredibly clear: somebody hated Dawn Schiff. Enough to kill.","Mcfadden is finally back after some let-downs. This was a fast-paced thriller for sure. I liked the characters, which is great after being so dissatisfied with the characters in never lie and ward d. Even if the main character had her flaws, I felt they were explained better and there was some character development (at least a bit). I must admit I saw the twist coming, but was still curious about how it all would play out, so it was a breeze reading. In the afterword McFadden writes that she’s worked on this book for over 20 (!) years and that shows as I couldn’t find no obvious plot holes, and it was told convincingly. Maybe there was a bit too much spoon-feeding when it came to Dawn who obviously was on the spectrum, but from what I read it wasn’t too stereotypical, and I wasn’t annoyed by the way McFadden described her personality. There was actually a lovely moment in the end and I found myself tearing up. How often does that happen in your standard psychological thriller? Thanks to netgalley and the publisher for the arc",4.0
79,The Locked Door,Thriller,"Some doors are locked for a reason…While eleven-year-old Nora Davis was up in her bedroom doing homework, she had no idea her father was killing women in the basement.Until the day the police arrived at their front door.Decades later, Nora’s father is spending his life behind bars, and Nora is a successful surgeon with a quiet, solitary existence. Nobody knows her father was a notorious serial killer. And she intends to keep it that way.Then Nora discovers one of her young female patients has been murdered. In the same unique and horrific manner that her father used to kill his victims.Somebody knows who Nora is. Somebody wants her to take the fall for this unthinkable crime. But she’s not a killer like her father. The police can’t pin anything on her.As long as they don’t look in her basement.","I’m just not fully understanding the plethora of brilliant ratings for this very mediocre novel. The entire story is reminiscent of In My Father's Basement, but without the intense character development and attention to detail that made Payne’s tale a solid stroke of genius. Instead, the brusque, straightforward style employed by author Freida McFadden is almost too simplistic. The attempt here to portray Nora as a potential heir to her father’s murderous throne comes across as elementary in technique and is never completely convincing, while the final epilogue seals the book’s fate as a valiant effort, minus the “valiant”.",3.0
80,The Perfect Marriage,Thriller,"C. At 33 years old, she is a named partner at her firm and life is going exactly how she planned.The same cannot be said for her husband, Adam. He is a struggling writer who has had little success in his career. He begins to tire of his and Sarah’s relationship as she is constantly working. Out in the secluded woods, at Adam and Sarah’s second home, Adam engages in a passionate affair with Kelly Summers.Then, one morning everything changes. Adam is arrested for Kelly’s murder. She had been found stabbed to death in Adam and Sarah’s second home. Sarah soon finds herself playing the defender for her own husband, a man accused of murdering his mistress. But is Adam guilty or is he innocent?","When I'm feeling a reading slump coming on, I usually pick up a nice fast-paced thriller to get me back into things. According to the reviews, The Perfect Marriage should have been that. All I can say is I guess it's true that it did make me want to read literally anything else.I don't get the hype. The writing isn't great, needs at least another round of editing, and there are plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. Everything is obvious, yet also verging on ridiculous, and people (mostly Adam) act absolutely moronic for no reason whatsoever.Everyone is awful, and not in an interesting way. Adam is the doucheiest misogynistic alpha male douchebag, not to mention a total dumbass, who seemed to do everything within his power to make himself look guilty. Sarah has to whisper ""bitch"" to herself whenever another woman in the room doesn't kiss her arse. The police investigation is laughable, so is the fact that they would charge Adam and send this to trial without accounting for several anomalies that showed up in the ""evidence"" (like someone else's DNA). Sarah, a lawyer, gets more facts on this case than the police have by simply having a conversation with the victim's colleague, which I guess the police neglected to do. And that attempt to explain away the shoddy investigation with the ""oh, it was the sheriff's DNA"" left me far more annoyed than satisfied. Way too convenient and it didn't make any sense.Also, was Kelly in an abusive relationship? Because I'm pretty sure that wasn't cleared up(?) I don't like when a character knows something is or isn't true because they see it in someone's eyes, or some other such nonsense, but then it turned out that maybe he was lying? Who even knows?So many other things I could whine about. The dialogue and the characters' actions all seemed so juvenile; not a single member of law enforcement or attorney behaved with a hint of professionalism-- all of them acted seedy, violent or just plain stupid. I got the sense that the author had no idea about criminal investigations or court proceedings. It is irritating when I put things together way before the characters do and have to watch them scratch their heads and think ""where have I seen this guy before?"" It is also irritating when characters act one way for the entire book then turn to the audience and mwahaha at the end.So much doesn't make sense. The outcome of this book is only reached by having everyone be stupid and do silly things for no reason.",1.0
81,One by One,Thriller,"One by one, they will get what they deserve...A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.Then Claire’s minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren’t as easy to navigate as they thought.Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost. And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear:Only one of them will return home alive.","I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",3.0
82,Listen for the Lie,Mystery,"Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast ""Listen for the Lie,"" and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
83,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
85,The Silent Patient,Thriller,"A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0

The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him. He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his computer shows strange searches. He says they weren't made by him. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone.So what did happen to Nick's beautiful wife?","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0

I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0

My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0

What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.","2.5 stars?This was straight-up hilarious. The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that people cried while reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑 So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman, this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is. Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don't even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue. She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn't concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in. Oh but she's so evil😢, oh but she's so callous🙄, she's just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time. Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes: 💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean like literally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I'd be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me. 

I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.

How I imagined Verity every time she'd unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.

my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast. My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy. Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.

Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I was half fully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav. I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn't creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie. 

He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.

And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I've ever read. EVER. In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you'd expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We're not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn't care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power. EDIT 08.2022: 8 months later and I've decided we're gonna talk about the ending. Here's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I'm gonna choose the letter. As we've already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn't any better. Personally being impressed with the author's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist... WOULD BE if this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn't, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one. all in all: I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that's about it.EDIT 10.2022: I've read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍",2.0
90,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Fiction,"Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and entertainingly atmospheric novel.","I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0

His baffling conclusion: it is the work of the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood presumed extinct for nearly four hundred years - reborn to continue their bitter vendetta against their sworn enemy, the Catholic church.In Rome, the college of cardinals assembles to elect a new pope. Yet somewhere within the walls of the Vatican, an unstoppable bomb of terrifying power relentlessly counts down to oblivion. While the minutes tick away, Langdon joins forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to decipher the labyrinthine trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome to the long-forgotten Illuminati lair - a secret refuge wherein lies the only hope for the Vatican.But with each revelation comes another twist, another turn in the plot, which leaves Langdon and Vetra reeling and at the mercy of a seemingly invisible enemy...","(B-) 70% | SatisfactoryNotes: The apotheosis of laugh out loud, so-bad-it's-good writing, it's at first enthralling but descends into garish absurdity.",2.0
92,Sharp Objects,Mystery,"Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: she must return to her tiny hometown to cover the unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming.Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 0307341550 (ISBN 13: 9780307341556)","“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.”
There is something deeply unhealthy about this book. It's in the characters, in the story, in the relationships, in the sex, and just in the general mood of the novel. Reading this made me feel a little unwell, both physically and mentally, but I am glad I did. If you know me, you'll know I love complex characters with issues that feel raw and real, rather than melodramatic. The people in this novel are majorly fucked up, no one is without a dark past and everyone, it seems, has a horror story.The protagonist - Camille Preaker - was just thirteen when her sister died and fuelled by grief (amongst other things) Camille spent her teen years carving words into her flesh, covering almost every inch of her body with the marks of her pain. Ten years later, Camille Preaker is now a journalist who returns to the small town of her youth to report on the murders of two young girls - girls who had had all of their teeth removed.Camille is soon caught up in the town once again, she tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the troublesome half sister she hardly knows. It seems that once again small towns hold the biggest secrets and Camille finds herself getting dragged deeper and deeper into the investigation, her fragile state of mind constantly threatening to tip her over the edge.This is one mean and nasty book. I knew I was getting a dark, psychological thriller, but I expected something on par with In The Woods by Tana French. Um, not exactly. Flynn never shies away from the horrific details. You're not going to find anything pleasant in this story; sex, for example, is always something complex - it's an escape or a bargain or a catharsis. Everything else is similar.Flynn does a fantastic job of challenging the notion that women are weak, innocent, damsels in distress. In a world where women are victims - both in their media representation and in statistics - this is a very interesting look at other kinds of women. It's programmed into us to believe that women are safer, kinder, built with an instinct that makes it difficult for them to be cruel and cause pain without reason. Maybe we were always wrong.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",4.0
93,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

94,The Woman in the Window,Thriller,"Anna Fox lives alone, a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother and their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble and its shocking secrets are laid bare.What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.","Who knows what goes on in a family?
Okay, I really don't want to misrepresent this book: The Woman in the Window is a pulpy, fast-paced popcorn thriller. It's not mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it is pageturning goodness. And it was exactly what I needed to get lost in right now.The premise is a little bit of The Girl on the Train and a little bit of The Woman in Cabin 10 (what is it with these girl/woman/wife titles?!), with an unreliable narrator, faulty memories, alcoholism, and the author playing around with our perception of what is true and what is imagined. My need to know what would happen kept me turning pages late into the night until I was physically incapable of keeping my eyes open a moment longer.The Woman in the Window treats a rather obvious plot element as a spoiler for most of the book, so I'll play coy too. It's about a woman called Anna who lives alone ever since separating from her husband and daughter. We're not told the circumstances of the separation, but we do know that Anna has a drinking problem and severe agoraphobia that prevents her from leaving the house.Housebound and drunk, Anna spends her days spying on her neighbours, until one day she witnesses something shocking in the window of the Russell's home. Everything begins to unravel when Anna attempts to report what she saw, and soon everything is being questioned: Did Anna hallucinate? Is it a combination of alcohol and pills? Can she even trust herself?The chapters are short and hard-hitting, making the fast-moving plot zip by even faster (""This is the LAST chapter. Oh wait, the next is only two pages? Okay, this is the last chapter""). I think the author does a great job of capturing both the fuzzy-headed confusion brought on by Anna's alcoholism and the suffocating claustrophobia of staying inside for almost a year. She makes for a pretty great unreliable narrator, and it is easy to feel her frustration when she can't even be sure herself if what she says is completely true.I also really liked how the author included Anna's passion for classic thriller movies. These offer interesting parallels with her reality and make you question whether something really did happen, or if Anna just saw it in a movie. Plus there's something a bit creepy about all these black and white flicks playing out in the background.The Woman in the Window is the kind of cozy psychological thriller that is easy to gobble up in a sitting or two. I didn't even mind that some things were obvious because the getting there was so damn fun and suspenseful. I'll be on the lookout for more from Finn.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2.0
97,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
98,Dark Places,Mystery,"Libby Day was just seven years old when her evidence put her fifteen-year-old brother behind bars.Since then, she has been drifting. But when she is contacted by a group who are convinced of Ben's innocence, Libby starts to ask questions she never dared to before. Was the voice she heard her brother's? Ben was a misfit in their small town, but was he capable of murder? Are there secrets to uncover at the family farm or is Libby deluding herself because she wants her brother back?She begins to realise that everyone in her family had something to hide that day... especially Ben. Now, twenty-four years later, the truth is going to be even harder to find.Who did massacre the Day family?","“I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.”
I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity. Okay, sorry, I make it sound so negative when actually this book is pretty fantastic if you can stomach the horrors within. I ate this up in a couple of days, finding every opportunity to read that I could... Flynn certainly has a talent for dragging you into her stories and having them take you over until you find out just what the hell is going on.As much as I enjoyed its dark predecessor - Sharp Objects - I think Dark Places was, for me, a more complex and well-developed mystery. I had many theories as to what was going on and all of them were wrong. You know, I honestly think that writing a mystery story must be the most difficult of all, because the reader is your enemy. Most readers of mystery stories will analyse the information they're given, pull it apart, and try desperately to solve the mystery before the characters do - and yet, if they are successful, they feel disappointed. For an author to manage to pull out something both surprising and convincingly real at the end of all this, they have to have a talent for it.Dark Places alternates between the present day and 1985 when Ben Day allegedly massacred three members of his family, his sister - Libby - being the only one to escape and testify as a witness, sending Ben to a life in prison. Now, after years of living on the donations made by concerned members of the public, Libby Day has finally run out of money and is forced to earn some cash by making an appearance at a group meeting where the members believe Ben is innocent. At first, Libby is willing to write them off as crazy fanatics with a grisly obsession... but as more information is presented to her, she starts to question what really happened all those years ago.The story is told from three main points of view and, to say I'm not a fan of multiple perspectives, I thought it was done excellently. Patty Day is an exhausted mother-of-four who starts to fear her son is becoming involved in satanic rituals; torn between wanting to protect him and being a little afraid of what his behaviour means, we begin to question through her eyes whether the heavy metal-loving loner could really have it in him to become a murderer. Then we have Ben Day's point of view. Being inside his mind is a little frightening - we see how his thoughts become increasingly dark, how just wanting to have something normal can lead to the most abnormal behaviour... but does that mean he would really murder his family?And, of course, there is Libby Day. Libby Day is the reason I think I enjoy Flynn's novels so much. She is so imperfect, complex, selfish, violent... but somehow you manage to stay on her side. I have no idea how the author manages this, but I've always loved a protagonist with issues, the kind of issues that make them lash out in ways that would make you hate them if you weren't inside their head, understanding them. She does some horrible things and, though you don't necessarily forgive her for them, you are able to see why.If you're okay reading about filth, gore, and underage sex, then you should dive into this mystery straight away and immerse yourself in the disturbing but awesome mental workings of Gillian Flynn.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",5.0
99,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest,Fiction,"The stunning third and final novel in Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling trilogy.Lisbeth Salander - the heart of Larsson's two previous novels - lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She's fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she'll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revenge - against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back.~from the jacket","These books really shouldn't work. Stieg Larsson is a very weird writer. He likes to tell us absolutely everything someone is doing. If Stieg wrote the story of my morning, it would go like this:""Joel woke up around 7:45 a.m. and looked at the clock. He decided he didn't need to get up yet and hit the snooze button. When the alarm sounded again, he dragged himself out of bed and used the toilet. He brushed his teeth and then dressed in a blue striped shirt, black tie and flat front dress slacks he'd purchased on sale at Kohl's. He made himself a cup of coffee, fired up his 13-inch Macbook laptop and checked his email. He had 14 messages. 11 of them were advertisements from various mailing lists or spam emails encouraging him to enlarge his penis. One message was from his mother and two more were shipping notices for books he'd purchased from Amazon.com. He read the note from his mother but decided to reply later. He then deleted all the messages but the two from Amazon and closed his laptop. He sat on the couch and stared into space, drinking his coffee and thinking.""Most writers would probably start the scene several paragraphs later, when I finally get to work (that's where the real excitement happens! I check even MORE email!). (Plus it turns out I'm not even a main character.) But for some reason, this style is, I don't know, endearing instead of annoying. I love the way he tells us every time Mikael has a cigarette or what he likes on his sandwiches. And hey, at least I know what brand of cell phone everyone is using.It's kind of weird how the series wound up being not at all what I was expecting. Book one was closest, a serial killer story that was nevertheless a weird mash-up of political potboiler and are-the-lambs-screaming-Clarice murder fun. But then book two was mostly about the internal politics of the Swedish police and media industries. And the big climax of the trilogy comes down to an incredibly extended legal thriller, Grisham-style. I assume. I've never read a John Grisham book.But really, everyone knows why the books work, and it's because of the characters. Stieg approached the whole trilogy as a sort of manifesto about the injustices heaped upon women in Swedish society, and illustrates them via a host of compelling, level-headed, fairly well-rounded women who are fun to read about even when they spend every other page having sex with the Stieg stand-in. Everyone loves Lisbeth, of course, and this installment does a good job of fleshing out her back story and explaining how exactly one winds up a tattooed, antisocial computer-hacking genius with an insatiable hunger for revenge and Billy's pan pizza.This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. I don't read legal thrillers but I love courtroom scenes in movies, especially when judges say stuff like ""I'm going to allow it, but you'd better be going somewhere with this."" No one says that here, but only because apparently you can do whatever the fuck you want in a Swedish courtroom without bothering to talk to the judge at all. On the bright side, a flustered prosecutor does break out another old chestnut --""This is highly irregular!"" -- that almost makes up for it.So, yeah, I'm a little sad that Lisbeth has stalked off to that big Ikea-furnished apartment in the sky to join her creator. And I wish Stieg didn't eat quite so many of the fatty sandwiches and Billy's pan pizzas he loved detailing so much (hey, write what you know). If book 4 never emerges from that mythical laptop, though, this is a pretty good place to end things.",4.0

104,The Morningside,Fiction,"From the critically beloved, New York Times bestselling author of The Tiger's Wife and Inland, a magical novel of mothers and daughters, displacement and belonging, and myths both old and new.There’s the world you can see. And then there’s the one you can’t. Welcome to the Morningside.After being expelled from their ancestral home, Silvia and her mother finally settle at the Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family's past. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she know why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia's lonely and impoverished reality.Enchanted by Ena’s stories, Silvia begins seeing the world with magical possibilities and becomes obsessed with the mysterious older woman who lives in the penthouse of the Morningside. Bezi Duras is an enigma to everyone in the building. She has her own elevator entrance and leaves only to go out at night and walk her three massive hounds, often not returning until the early morning. Silvia’s mission to unravel the truth about this woman’s life, and her own haunted past, may end up costing her everything.Startling, inventive, and profoundly moving, The Morningside is a novel about the stories we tell—and the stories we refuse to tell—to make sense of where we came from and who we hope we might become.","The Morningside by Téa Obreht is a Family and Literary Fiction Story Sprinkled With Magical Realism and Set in a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic World! 
Holy-Moly! There's a lot going on in this story...
Silvia knows little about where she's from, why they had to leave, or why her mother keeps their past so secretive. The only thing she knows is now they're living at The Morningside, an aging luxury high-rise in Island City where her Aunt Ena has lived and worked for the past ten years.  Silvia loves her conversations with Aunt Ena, who feeds her imagination with stories about the homeland she doesn't remember. Silvia becomes enamored by Ena's tales and her imagination spills over with thoughts about the mysterious resident living in the penthouse. She makes it her focus to discover the truth about this woman's life... The Morningside is a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic story written in the first-person narrative of curious eleven-year-old Silvia. Silvia is quiet, bright, and observant and possesses keen senses for a child her age. Perhaps it's due to being raised by a mother who shares little that Silvia is driven to find answers on her own. Silvia meets two individuals she develops friendships with and it's through these connections the story becomes more about the characters and relationships and less about the changing world described in Obreht's lovely writing. The story can feel cramped with melodrama and distractions, jumping from one catastrophe to the next, and taking abrupt turns through unexpected decisions by the characters. For me, it added additional layers and interest.The Morningside is creative and original storytelling about a mother-daughter relationship, finding family, and discovering your place in the world. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a well-written character-driven Family and Literary Fiction story with touches of Magical Realism like I do. I plan to look at Téa Obreht's backlist for more to read while I wait for her next book!4⭐Thank you to Random House and Téa Obreht for a physical ARC, and a DRC of this book through NetGalley. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review. Due to publish 3/19/24!",4.0

That is until a brutal encounter with a ghost from his past sees him beaten, battered and almost drowning in the Thames.He wakes the next day to find he’s in a messy, derelict room he’s never seen before, in grimy clothes he doesn’t recognize, with no idea of how he got there. A glimpse in the mirror tells him he’s older—much older—and has been living a hard life, his features ravaged by time and poor decisions. He snatches a newspaper and finds it’s 2010—fifteen years since the fight.After finally drifting off to sleep, Alex wakes the following morning to find it’s now 2019, another nine years later. But the next day, it’s 1999. Never knowing which day is coming, he begins to piece together what happens in his life after that fateful night by the river.But what exactly is going on? Why does his life look nothing like he thought it would? What about Cambridge, and Holly?

And that might be all he needs to save the people he loves and, equally importantly, himself.","The story in this book starts in 1995 when Alex Dean is a young man who met the love of his life and has a bright future ahead of him. Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion. It leaves us to wonder and analyze our own lives to decide that we made the best decisions in the course of it.",4.0

✔️ morally gray shadow daddy 🩶🥵✔️complex characters ✔️love triangle ✔️touch her and die vibes 🔪✔️Celtic mythology✔️unique magic-heroine has botanical magic 🌿✔️story telling/riddles✔️HFNFia grows up wanting to only be loved and has to constantly prove her worth to others due to her fae heritage. She is trained to be an assassin and goes through much abuse by the queen’s right hand. I found her to be an extremely likable and relatable heroine. She’s learning who she is as a woman and discovering herself. While also having to discover the truth because everyone is spinning a different tale. She’s strong, fierce, funny, but also vulnerable and wants to feel true love.Rogan is her childhood best friend and the prince who is betrothed to the princess. He always showed her kindness and as they grew older they fell in love with each other. But due to political reasons he did not choose her and this broke Fia. Do I dislike Rogan? Yes and no. He’s a product of his environment and has been fed lies distorting his beliefs. During their mission feelings com back and confuses the lines of their friendship. I believe he does love Fia in his own way but not all parts of her.Irian aka shadow daddy 🤪 is mysterious, dangerous, powerful and full of secrets. Something about a man that tries to kill you upon meeting is kind of hot ..talk about a meet-cute 🤭 I will fall hard for any morally gray character it’s a natural given..I’m hoping in the next book we get more information about him he’s an intriguing character. I loved their moments together he loves Fia fiercely and allows her to be herself.

I received a copy of If the Tide Turns by Rachel Rueckert from Kensington Publishing and Edelweiss Plus in exchange for an honest review. The well written debut novel is told from the points of view of Maria and Sam and inspired by a real-life pirate Sam Bellamy. The reader's given an idea of what piracy was really like in the early 1700's, life in Colonial America, use of herbal medicine, banishment of women, evils of slavery and the plight of the Native American Wampanoag people. An historical saga about the lure of the sea, overcoming obstacles, young love and four stars from me.",4.0

109,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

110,Song of the Huntress,Fantasy,"The acclaimed author of Sistersong transforms the story of Herla and the Wild Hunt into a rich, feminist fantasy in this stunning tale of two great warriors, a war-torn land, and an ancient magic that is slowly awakening.Britain, 60AD. Hoping to save her lover, her land, and her people from the Romans, Herla makes a desperate pact with the king of the Otherworld. But years pass unheeded in his realm, and she escapes to find everyone she loved long dead. Cursed to wield his blade, she becomes Lord of the Hunt. And for centuries, she rides, leading her immortal warriors and reaping wanderers’ souls. Until the night she meets a woman on a bloody battlefield—a Saxon queen with ice-blue eyes.Queen Æthelburg of Wessex is a proven fighter. But when she leads her forces to disaster in battle, her husband’s court turns against her. Yet King Ine needs Æthel more than ever. Something dark and dangerous is at work in the Wessex court. His own brother seeks to usurp him. And their only hope is the magic in Ine’s bloodline that’s lain dormant since ancient days.The moment she and Æthel meet, Herla knows it’s no coincidence. The dead kings are waking. The Otherworld seeks to rise, to bring the people of Britain under its dominion. And as Herla and Æthel grow closer, Herla must find her humanity—and a way to break the curse—before it’s too late.","The stronger aspect of this book is also its biggest weakness: the writing is pretty and has a good rhythm overall, but it's also prone to archaisms and the occasional purple-prosery; and it uses third person present tense narration for a POV, too, which some readers don't enjoy, me amongst them. On top of that, the pace of the story is so painfully slow it's very tempting to abandon the book for the slow-as-molasses progress and the unnecessary roundabouts. It makes the book easy to put down and resume later, yes, but also very easy to forget.Set in 8th century Britain, Song of the Huntress has a trio of protagonists: Herla, the leader of the Wild Hunt, Æthelburg, Queen of Wessex, and Ine, King of Wessex, and pretends to be a character-driven story of struggle, personal growth, and power, faith, and politics in times when Anglo-Saxons vie for the rule of the new lands they conquer and conflict arises between the old and the new religions. If you're interested in this time period, the historical novel with low magic feel of this book should be far more enjoyable to you than if you aren't, as is my case. But regardless of personal investment in the period, it's probably the characters that'll hold your interest most, although for me it didn't work that way either as it was very hard to connect or care about them for how unrelatable and distant they felt. I did find Ine a tad more interesting as a character than either Herla or Æthelburg, though, who are a bit more stereotypical (in the ""strong women"" cliché sense), mainly because it's the first time I see a man of that era struggling with asexuality and it was intriguing to see. Historically accurate? No, not really, pre-modern views and understanding of sexuality weren't like ours, which is why I find the much-lauded queer representation here rather forced, but your mileage may vary, as they say.There's really not much else to say, it really was this dull for me personally; little happening, much describing, and characterisation that could've been much more fetching.

In the industrial city of Theumas, she is seen not as a healer, but a monster that kills for pleasure.When Nhika is caught using her bloodcarving abilities during a sham medical appointment, she's captured by underground thugs and sold to an aristocratic family to heal the last witness of their father’s murder.But as Nhika delves deeper into their investigation amidst the glitz of Theumas’ wealthiest district, she begins to notice parallels between this job and her own dark past. And when she meets an alluring yet entitled physician's aide, Ven Kochin, she’s forced to question the true intent behind this murder. In a society that outcasts her, Kochin seems drawn to her...though he takes every chance he gets to push her out of his opulent world.When Nhika discovers that Kochin is not who he claims to be, and that there is an evil dwelling in Theumas that runs much deeper than the murder of one man, she must decide where her heart, and her allegiance, truly lie. And -- if she's willing to become the dreaded bloodcarver Theumas fears -- to save herself and the ones she's vowed to protect.","The Diverse BaselineFebruary Prompt C: A book by a BIPOC author with found family★★★½ rounded upIn a sea of extremely mediocre YA Asian Fantasy debuts, The Last Bloodcarver does the impossible and draws me in. As often is the case, Nhika falls into the trap of being naïve and cliché. She is hoodwinked by multiple people, before coming into her own.As the wave of Vietnamese diaspora fiction continues to hit the shelves, I have been eagerly waiting for more Southeast Asian lore to make its way into my hands. Since I grew up in the West, inundated with Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, and am slowly but surely educating myself on East Asian lore, I find myself searching for the myths of my homeland. This is a start. (Make sure you pick up The Crossbow of Destiny in August.)Where so many of the Asian fantasies seem to go wrong is the glorification of colonization. I will be the first to admit that I was worried about how this would turn out. Fear not, Nhika is very proud to be Yarongese. As she was born in Theumas, she has never even seen her oft dreamt about homeland. She barely speaks the language. She feels unconnected to her mother and grandmother's land and healing practices. This obviously hit me in the feels.Nhika's gift deals with healing. She is from a land of magic. The place she lives deals more with science, and these people see her as other. Deep in this underworld of training and secrets, she meets a dark haired mysterious stranger. Again, fret not. I'm eager to see how the author will continue this story.🎧 NetGalley",4.0

thank you so much Day Leitao for providing me with an ARC to read and review!
2.7⭐I'm still feeling unsure about this book. there were some parts I enjoyed but also definitely some things I really didn't enjoy... but let me tell you a bit about the plot first.➥ plotthe story follows the main character astra, who grows up in a kind of school where she and other people get trained to be a substitute who will pretend to be the princess and the prince of their kingdom to save them in specific situations. additionally, she has to keep her true heritage (which i won't spoil) hidden.astra isn't really happy with her life since she wants to have a kindred one (kind of like a boyfriend but on a deeper level), who she also dreams about but isn't able to figure out who he is. after an incident where she already met him, she is forced to get married to the king's evil brother, marlak. now, she has to live with him, which leads to secrets being uncovered, discoveries of magic and other kingdoms, friendships being formed and love being found. that's kind of it. I don't really have an issue with the plot, I liked the overall story line. I do feel like it's more of a character-driven story, since there weren't many plot twists and the main ones were solely ar the end. instead, i learned more about the characters' background story - not suuuper much though - , followed the development of different feelings, and saw them turn into the people they were in the end and followed. I have to mention that it sometimes felt more like I was told what would happen or what was happening in a way too descriptive style, not really giving me the chance to fully dive into the moment and experience the same feelings as the characters. kinda like ""more tell than show"". the big plot twist in the end wasn't extremely surprising since part of it got explained right away, but it still opens the opportunity for another book. ➥ worldthe story is set in a fantasy world rather similar to for example the acotar world: there are different courts with different beings, such as fae people, nyxes and humans for example, and different rules. i enjoyed discovering that, however didn't learn that much about the courts since the story mainly played in two to three different ones. what I liked the most about the fantasy aspect were the different magical powers. It was fun to discover them and their various divisions. sadly, I feel like I again only got ""surface information"", never really having the chance to get a deeper understanding of how they worked and which existed. ➥ writing aka my biggest issueas I already said in one of my updates, my biggest issue was the way this book was written. while reading, I made a little list of the things that bothered me along the way: - repeated words, especially a constant use of ""(and) then"", ""well"", ""perhaps"", ""and yet"", ""the truth is""/""in truth"". from beginning to end, these words followed me. sometimes, a word would be repeated numerous times on only one page. this got annoying extremely fast and sadly ruined my complete reading experience.also, there was an unnecessary amount of words like ""ugh"" and ""wow"". luckily, that got better in the end. additionally, the endearments ""wife"" and “husband"" were extremely (!!!) overused.- the way this was written also kinda felt more like a stream of thoughts than like an organised text, which just made it feel somewhat inexperienced. - fitting to what I just talked about is that astra's inner thoughts were constantly full of questions. while this was entertaining in the beginning, it just got annoying the more i read. it felt like an excuse to not answer the questions, maybe wanting to build suspension but then never really answering them. i think that's also the reason why I don't know much about the magic etc, I only read her questions but those just didn't get answered. - I don't really know how to put this next thing into words because I myself don't totally understand what's happening but sentences like ""Why didn't I run with Otavio? I know why, and yet..."" or ""your power is quite impressive. quite impressive. doesn't impress me, ..."" just felt extremely contradicting, which was bothersome. why would you say something only to answer it with the opposite?! - lastly, some parts of the writing felt lazy, such as ""There's just something so comforting about it, so... I don't even know how to explain it"". like, just explain it or don't mention it at all, right?!  so, as you can see, there were quite some things that irked me and made it impossible for me to completely dive into the story. I think it got better in the middle - or i just got used to it HAHA...➥ characterswhile Astra was the main character and I experienced everything through her pov, my feelings toward her aren't many or deep. I think I like her, despite sometimes not really enjoying her inner monologue (there was just so much of it). I mostly liked her braveness and will to fight for herself while also being okay with showing some vulnerability. however, my favourite character was marlak - but I also don't have many thoughts about him. I really enjoyed his sweetness and utter politeness, which he showed from beginning on. he cares a lot about those he loves and tries to always protect them. his sarcasm was funny and i liked discovering his traumatic past - not because i like that he has experienced those things, but because it brings depth into his character. he's also quite hot, honestly, and wears fancy rings hihi.the side characters were nice, but not very memorable since they don't play a big role at all. ➥ AstraMarlaksince their marriage was a forced one but they still learn to love each other, I got a great enemies to lovers story, which was the book's strongest aspect. I liked the sexual tension between astra and marlak, which was supported by the dreams, and their bantering. to observe them slowly accepting that tension was fun and I especially enjoyed all the small moments where marlak showed his soft spot for astra. ➥ conclusionokay, now that I've said all that, I think I can say that this was a book with a lot of potential, but sadly didn't meet my expectations. I'd still say that you should give it a try, especially if you don't really mind the negative things I said about the writing style. because, as i just said, the book definitely has potential!! I don't know if I'll read the next book, but since I don't want to leave all my questions unanswered, I probably will. -------------------having mixed feelings rn rtc!--------------------got another arc hihi 🤭 hope it'll be good 🤞🏻",3.0
115,The Midnight Library,Fiction,"Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0
116,The Wicked King,Fantasy,"You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.The first lesson is to make yourself strong.After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★

“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”

Many of you might not know this but on this day many years ago, Holly Black’s biggest fan was born. Spoiler: it’s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn’t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I’m just that extra, but The Wicked King is perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I’ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. But every time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I’d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too. The Wicked King is the second installment in The Folk of the Air series, the first being my favorite book of 2017, The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So, please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled for The Cruel Prince!

“I want to tell you so many lies.”

(The most breathtaking fanart by Loweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is *clutches pearls forever* the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn’t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them. 

“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”

And everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase “twists and turns” doesn’t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won’t know who or what to believe, and you surely won’t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page. And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren’t wrong. You all thought The Cruel Prince cliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won’t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I’m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I’ve ever read in my entire life. Okay, I’m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also, Roiben plays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it! (My favorite fanart(s) by PhantomRin!)➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love. 

“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I’m so sorry, neighbors, if you’re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of “book boyfriends” until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - I’m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I’ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he’s going to be the “big bad” of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play. 

“I wish he hadn’t used me to test my sister’s love for him. I wish she hadn’t let him.”

➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I’m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella, The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it’s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I’m ready for it. Oh, and in case I haven’t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don’t say that lightly. I thought in The Cruel Prince that it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while reading The Wicked King I realized that it’s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you’ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don’t even know how I’m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical. 

“You are my dearest punishment.”

But this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it’s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully. 

“It’s easy to put your own life on the line, isn’t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.”

I’m not sure I’ve ever been as happy reading a book as I’ve been reading The Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It’s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word. 

“He looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don’t. We don’t share anything.”

Overall, this review doesn’t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos, Frank Ocean, and The Wicked King by Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it’s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I’d just ask for more.

117,The Queen of Nothing,Fantasy,"Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold onto. Jude learned this lesson when she released her control over the wicked king, Cardan, in exchange for immeasurable power. Now as the exiled mortal Queen of Faerie, Jude is powerless and left reeling from Cardan’s betrayal. She bides her time determined to reclaim everything he took from her. Opportunity arrives in the form of her deceptive twin sister, Taryn, whose mortal life is in peril.Jude must risk venturing back into the treacherous Faerie Court, and confront her lingering feelings for Cardan, if she wishes to save her sister. But Elfhame is not as she left it. War is brewing. As Jude slips deep within enemy lines she becomes ensnared in the conflict’s bloody politics. And, when a dormant yet powerful curse is unleashed, panic spreads throughout the land, forcing her to choose between her ambition and her humanity… From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black, comes the highly anticipated and jaw-dropping finale to The Folk of the Air trilogy.","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★2.) The Wicked King ★★★★★

“By you, I am forever undone.”

I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending. Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.) I vlogged this entire reading experience (and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened in The Cruel Prince, The Lost Sisters, & The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later! After the very heartbreaking end of The Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter. 

“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”

Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death. It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted. 

“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”

And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence. 

“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”

Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly. This next section of my review is going to have SPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not read The Queen of Nothing and all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart. 

“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”

➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. 

“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - We love a good redemption arc, wow. ➽ 
 Grima Mog
 - Nothing but love and respect for my war general. ➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers. ➽ 
 Vivi
 - My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking. ➽ 
 Oak
 - Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off. ➽ 
 Madoc
 - Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup. Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying. I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that. 

“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”

I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read. I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie. I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me. Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the way The Folk of the Air has made me feel.

He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined -- every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.","For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,  I loved it shamelessly,  warts and all .And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe (I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty? 
I think this book will alienate quite a few of Hunger Games fans. You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. But The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become. You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here (or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes). I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But he has some humanity in him - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice. The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it. He chooses complicity — and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey. 
 “So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”
 
This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.
 “We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”
It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it only as far as it suits his comfort. Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.
 “His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”
No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can reread The Hunger Games trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.

  y'allll when I tell you this line made me- ALEXA PLAY LITERALLY ANY LOVE SONG BY TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE EVAJACKS ARE EVERYTHING AND SO IS TAYLOR SWIFT.(there will be spoilers if you haven't read this book so be wary!)Ok so here we finally are. The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don't even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It's gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it's not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I'll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo's first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke: “He'd never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks's chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let's just say, that's definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let's just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that's true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I'm pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it's cute, because it wasn't, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won't be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I'm still bitter that Tella didn't pop up in a cameo. I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I've already written so much so here's my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much was because of the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she's a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn't as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won't get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I'm messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts's mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don't end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼‍♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don't matter or aren't important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks's story is so good, I can't even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I'm all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn't paying much attention, sooo when I'm less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I'm ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars

120,Lightlark,Fantasy,"Welcome to the Centennial. Every 100 years, the island of Lightlark appears to host the Centennial, a deadly game that only the rulers of six realms are invited to play. The invitation is a summons—a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm’s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling—a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray…even as love complicates everything.","EDIT 8/17/2022As someone who dropped one of the first comprehensive bad reviews on this book, I just wanna say I do not support the review bombing of it. It’s tacky and uncouth and what bigots do every time there are women in a TV show. We’re better than this. This situation could been a constructive conversation about the quality of a book, privileges, the highly commercialized state of publishing, the influence of tiktok, or false advertising, and instead we’re having NONE of those. Do not invalidate anyone’s identity. This is unproductive and invasive speculation. Focus on actions, on stuff that’s actually happening. C’mon, be real. _____________________I rarely use GoodReads, but because I received an advanced copy of the book, I thought it best to distribute this review across all platforms where I have an account. You can find me over on the storygraph, username bean. Thanks for the arc btw!Where to begin?I picked up this book because of tiktok. This book got picked up by a publisher because of tiktok. This book is a tiktok success story, an amalgamation of all that tiktok has to offer, and by extension, all the books that are popular on tiktok before it. Calling it pastiche would be kind. Each scene felt very reminiscent of something out of another YA book. Many, many YA books. So much of this book is borrowed from ACOTAR that any differentiation from the plot of ACOTAR felt like a subversion of story even if it made perfect sense within Lightlark's narrative. Also, I can proudly say that any comparison to the Hunger Games is unwarranted. It's a terrible comparison that sets up false expectations. More accurately, it's ACOTAR meets the Selection. Yeah. Before I really lay into this book, I'll say that I understand why people would like it. I understand the appeal. Some people like reading 100 different versions of the same kind of book. I get it. It's comforting. I am also that way with certain genres of books or types of movies. But comfort, familiarity, they're not tangible measures of storytelling quality. It's possible to be comforted and find excitement in something that suffers from flaws. So, make peace with that.I'll work my way up.The building blocks of story are prose. Aster's prose is not bad, but undercooked and sometimes repetitive. Unique metaphors are one-hit wonders, if you pull them out again, we will notice (hair like ink on his brow, buttery sunlight). It does not read like fantasy prose and feels entirely too modern. That was a problem deeper than prose, but certainly evident in the writing style. I had the privilege of consuming this novel on audiobook, and without the narrator, many writing faults would be more evident. (Also, I don't know how to spell any of these names because I read it on audiobook. So sorry for that.)That being said, it is consumable. I could get through it. I feel like I had an okay sense of where the characters were spacially. I knew where they were mentally because the author would just tell us. It's a common vice in Young Adult. The blatant explanations of Isla's struggle in her internal monologue and the faux femininist ideology of this book that would've been standard in the early 2010s really highlighted Sarah J Maas' writing as inspiration. Which kind of sucks, because her prose isn't good either.Now onto the premise. There are six rulers of six different realms trying to break their curses by competing in a Centennial, a game that takes place on an island that only emerges every hundred years. Simple enough? No it isn't.Listen, I am a seasoned fantasy reader. More than that, I was a Supernatural fan in my heyday. I have made sense of many things that do not make sense.This book did not make sense.First and foremost, it's impossible to get a real grasp on stakes. These lands have been suffering with their curses for five hundred years. And some of the curses are gnarly! The wildling's curse is that they have to eat a human heart every month to survive. But then, the people here live to be very old? Which, presumably means that they don't have very many children. The population can't be that high, because it wouldn't be sustainable if people are living longer. So how do they have even a year's supply of hearts? It's explained to us that the wildlings are dying, that their realm is losing power, that they don't have enough hearts to sustain them, but it's so hard to have a good grasp on exactly what's going on because there are so many variables that are vaguely explained. Are they at half their power, a tenth? How big are they compared to other realms? How many people do they lose a year? We need to understand the stakes! Please!For example, both of the love interests in this thing are over 500 years old. Yet, the starling curse is that their people don't live past the age of 25. How- I can't even wrap my head around it. In a world where people are living centuries, you give them a quarter of one, and barely explain its repercussions. Every single person in that realm was raised by teenagers. They're all young parents or teen moms. Saying that's the curse and that obviously it sucks and that's why their numbers are dwindling is not good enough, because I cannot understand the stakes. I don't understand how this was sustainable for 500 years and it's not anymore. I don't understand the ways the world has changed in a way that has material impacts on the average person besides ""yeah they'll die early"". Some of this stuff was touched on, but not developed. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm reading it with other people who got the arc, and we're all missing something then.Okay, slight tangent, but it's clear that this world was not thought about at all. Because, naturally, I feel like there would be more inter-realm interaction if they were all weakened? The wildling realm could get their hearts from starlings who die early. Starling would not be much of a realm of its own, but instead be an orphaned diaspora at risk of fizzling out. Other realms would take advantage of their naivete and lack of mentorship. And so on and so forth.There was some bending over backwards to explain away magial heirs and create the stakes that if someone dies in the game, their realm dies. We don't find out until like 75% throughout the book that people begin to age when they have kids because of passing down magic and heirs and whatever. She mentions elders, but then what would an elder be? How old would they be? If someone can live to a thousand without having kids and still look like they're in their 20s, is that an elder? How long do people live after they have kids? I feel like naturally, that would disincentivize having kids which once again begs the question where tf are the wildlings getting their hearts? I read this book with someone who spent the majority of it convinced that [redacted] was Isla's father, which wouldn't have been possible if any of this was actually made clear. I also might have missed it, but maybe only the realm rulers live hella long. I doubt it though because it seems like everyone in this world connected to a realm has powers. The fact that I can't tell really just proves how convoluted the worldbuilding was. My confusion effectively killed the stakes for this book, and I could not find a foothold for the forthcoming tension. I could keep going for like five pages trying to talk about how the worldbuilding was thoughtless and an active detriment to the story. Also how it feels ACOTAResque. I did not want to live in the Lightlark world. I don't even want to visit. I don't have a good grasp on how much magic is in the world, how they lived so long with the curses, how many people live there, or even what it looks like. I was imagining traditional fantasy stuff until homegirl mentions a bra and then I was like hold the phone. Hairclips and scrunchies don't even exist in this world, and she's out here with a BRA?The main character, Isla, is insufferable, though I've read worse. Her entire thing is not having agency, but then she'll regularly let her emotions get the better of her and make the entire situation worse when she does make decisions. I did not care for her. I felt like a lot of internal character logic was warped for the sake of plot or love interest situations. Not a fan! It's somehow more frustrating than the miscommunication trope, and not in a good way! Small knit pick, but I hate how her name was pronounced Ice-lah. Like, if it's not gonna be pronounced like Isla, just spell it differently. Eisla. There. Fixed it!The love interests. I have nothing else to say other than Grim is Rhysand from ACOTAR and Oro is Prince Maxon from the Selection if he was OP and had hella magic. That perfectly encapsulates both how their written and the extent of their dynamics. It's so reminiscent of ~other stuff~ it's difficult to see them as their own established characters, especially Grim. They're both like 500 years old and have a rivalry.I don't know who finds the 500 year man and 18 year old girl romance appealing, but I'm so tired of it. It's laughable. Even if they look 20... seriously? Every time I remember the character's ages, and how they actually act in the book, I have to laugh. Even just the fact that she beats them both in combat. It's like... okay. Both of these men led their armies in a war against each other 500 years ago and have been practicing fighting since and they just got their asses beat by an 18 year old. She wasn't even doing anything new that they haven't seen or her puting her own spin on it. She just beat them. Funny. I know it's YA and the main character needs some quality that gives her worth like that, but it's just so jarring. Grim's dialogue is attrocious. I can't even tell if the other dialogue in the book is alright, or if it just looks fine next to whatever comes out of his mouth.Pacing of this thing was excruciating. It slows down a lot at the 30% mark, and doesn't pick up again until the 70% mark. Basically, the second act is a slog. Once you reach the midpoint, it feels like it should be the break into the third act, but it's not. A lot of this felt like filler. Aster could've combined scenes easily. The trials were boring to read, and felt like there were no real stakes or reasoning behind them. They were there to give structure to the book. I don't get why the centennial was pitched as a competitive game. All realms but one benefit from the curse being broken, so why would they all compete against each other so insularly? Realistically, yes, they would've competed but it would be more political intregue, alliances and whispering behind doors, and less of whatever this is... the Selection trying to be sold as the Hunger Games. Now, the plot twist. This thing has been teased up and down. The plot twist! The plot twist! Does the plot twist make sense? Tecnically, after like 10 minutes of explanation, yeah. Is it good? ... No. I thought the plot twist would make us re-examine a lot of the relationships that the entire book spent cultivating. It would add new insight. It did play with our perception, but it felt really out of left field. A good plot twist adds nuance. This. This was not that. This book was so entrenched deeply in plot and love interests that it lost track of like... theme. And now the things that happen in the plot are meant to inform theme. How the plot twist should reflect on theme. Maybe I'm the dumb one here, but I just thought the twist was cheap.In the hands of a more competent author, this could've been an intriguing high fantasy. Maybe it could've been written in multiple POVs and really intereacted with its characters as rulers of dying kingdoms, and the character motivations that go along with it. I want to see what Cleo's secret was! I wanted to see how Azul faced his fears! I wanted to see how the world's consequences and the rulers' motivations interacted and intersected and led to unlikely alliances and power plays. Or, at the very least I wanted to see some cool action scenes. Even within the context of what it is, as a female-led YA book, I would've wanted... something new. Something different. Something other than another sheltered girl who's really good at fighting and falling in love. Lean into the fantasy, lean into what makes this book different. Because it just feels the same. At least define the atmosphere to be unique or noteworthy, because for all that convoluted worldbuilding, nothing feels new.MINOR SPOILERS//I saved this paragraph for last because it has to do with the plot twist, so if you're avoiding spoilers, look away. I won't say exactly what the twist was, but I will say by the end of it, there are no morally good female characters in the book besides the MC and a servant girl who gets two lines. And when I say not morally good, I mean they're like straight up evil. Backstabbing betrayal. Any betrayal or misstep by a man is handled with miles more nuance and forgiveness than anything a woman does in this book. The women's motivations are cartoonishly handled, and in the end, the ones responsible for the MC's plight. Very, very boring. Very tiring. Their decisions don't even foil the MC. It doesn't inform theme. It's. I don't know. It's just... in 2022? Really? We're doing this? I'm gonna have to add more stipulations to the Bechdel test because come on.I don't want to write a conclusion, so I won't. Thanks for the arc. My curiosity has been quenched. Tiktok will love this book. I can't imagine that it's translation to film will be good. I say that as a film reviewer who doubles as an avid reader. Things aren't looking good.EDIT 8/15/2022Dropping it to one star for visibility and also because I thought more about the plot twist and realized none of the actual actions lined up with the convoluted motivations.Also, for people who are critical of Aster as an industry plant, I highly suggest you read more about her sister, Daniella Pierson, and how she made a creative agency focusing on tiktok marketing called Newsland along with her newsletter. Industry plants do not exist in publishing, but money and connections do lend privilege, which is nothing new. This kind of success has happened before. Ernest Cline had a movie deal for Ready Player One before the book was out. Then again, both RPO and Lightlark are highly commercialized novels, which I do consider an issue when regarding the industry as a whole and what becomes popular.I recommend Ursula Le Guin’s essay titled “A Matter of Trust” from the Wave in the Mind if you are a young writer aspiring to become better at the craft and feel tempted by the appeal of quick commercial success. I’ll put it in front of every tiktok and twitter author if I have to lol. Eat your vegetables (serious, challenging novels that challenge you to think). Reading for entertainment is fine, but your writing will become so much better if you understand what makes great books great in a deeper sense, which necessitates a balanced diet. Trope marketing also plays into the increasing commercialization of novels, which Aster has utilized heavily, despite many of her tiktoks being misleading. False advertisement is not good marketing, which is why we’re now seeing a backlash. But also writing a highly commercial book is not a good book, because tropes are tools and not substance. Sell substance to readers. Anyways it’s very clear to me that Aster cares about writing and storytelling, but perhaps not as much the art or craft of it. To quote Billy Joel, slow down you crazy child, you’re so ambitious for a juvenile.I am unfortunately a bit of an aspiring writer myself (derogatory) and do not find my work to be anything good, or special. But making peace with this inspires me to be better, to work harder. I can take it, and I’m sure Aster can too. I have no doubt that Aster has worked hard, but her insistence on publishing this book even after her first agent dropped her for it and her claim that she does not suffer from imposter’s syndrome despite her massive premature success does lead me to believe that her writing is stunted from a lack of introspection. That isn’t to say she shouldn’t be proud of her work or achievements, but this entire mess is just reflective of an author who got way ahead of herself. Books are not as good as their marketing, their tropes, or anything else of that sort. They’re as good as the author makes it. Brandon Sanderson said (roughly from his BYU lectures), don’t focus on writing a good book, but becoming the kind of author capable of writing a good book. Which is what Aster has been working on, but if Lightlark is any reflection of her progress, she has a ways to go.",1.0

But as they come to live together again under one roof, the deep shared trauma of surviving such vicious circumstances sparks something magical, and Nica begins to fall for Rigel’s forbidden love.Before any relationship can become reality, though, they’ll have to face the darkness of their past . . . and the dangerous stakes of pursuing a future together.","edit #2: 28/05/22Ho dimenticato di precisare che qualche anno fa scoprii che la leggenda del fabbricante di lacrime è stata plagiata da Daniele Conserva nella sua raccolta di racconti “Il bosco dei violini e altre storie”. A me sinceramente interessa poco di quanto le sue accanitissime lettrici cerchino di farla passare come una causalità, è talmente palese che mi sembra ridicolo negare l’evidenza. Il tutto è reso ancora più divertente dalle azioni persecutrici di Erin Doom nei confronti di chi OSA criticare questo ammasso di paroloni buttati insieme e dal suo passato (di cui sono tristemente a conoscenza) fatto di intimidazioni e minacce legali (perché ricordo che è laureata in giurisprudenza) rivolte a chi su Wattpad osava avere qualche elemento vagamente simile ai suoi nella propria storia. Imbarazzante. Velo pietoso. ————————————————————————edit #1: rating cambiato da tre stelle a una.1⭐️Questo libro é la prova palese di come le autrici italiane debbano ricevere un ordine restrittivo nei confronti del bully romance. Se non lo sapete scrivere, non scrivetelo. TW: menzione di abusi fisici e sessuali Non è il primo libro che leggo dell’autrice, e anzi ho addirittura seguito gli aggiornamenti capitolo per capitolo da quando su Wattpad esisteva solo la trama. La conclusione? Il libro che meritava di uscire in libreria era decisamente il primo, non questo. Questo, sembra un ammasso di scene discutibili scritte in modo troppo arzigogolato che punta a essere un retelling di cappuccetto rosso e che fallisce malamente. L’altro era un bel libro, per gli standard di Wattpad. Andiamo per ordine. I protagonisti:Abbiamo Nica, la classica santarellina amante di flora e fauna che giustifica il suo essere una totale inetta con il suo passato da bambina abusata in orfanotrofio. Se vi sembra che la mia descrizione sia insensibile é perché insensibile é il modo in cui questo libro mi ha fatto sentire. Gli abusi sui bambini vengono trattati frettolosamente, sono molto confusi e sembrano semplicemente un modo per dare una parvenza di sfondo alle personalità dei due protagonisti. (Ovviamente sono grumpy boy/sunshine girl, se non si fosse capito). Seguire il punto di vista di Nica é stato snervante perché si tratta di una bambina di cinque anni nel corpo di una diciassettenne. I suoi unici interessi sono i cerotti che ha alle dita, gli insetti nel giardino di casa e gli occhi neri del fratellastro.Poi abbiamo Rigel, un mezzo stalker ossessionato che grazie a due note sul pianoforte riesce a farsi adottare con Nica. Questo ragazzo si può descrivere semplicemente come uno psicopatico. Non c’é un altro modo per parlarne perché il suo unico pensiero é la protagonista e per il resto la sua testa é vuota. Il suo unico tratto distintivo é saper suonare il pianoforte e essere bono come la luna le stelle e il firmamento, ah e giustificare la sua psicosi con una malattia rarissima al cervello. Se questa follia vi suona famigliare é perché l’abbiamo ritrovata in “The Villain” della Shen, con Cillian che teneva a bada le emozioni per tenere a bada la tourette. (Evidentemente é una cosa che tra le scrittrici di NA va di moda? Non saprei.) I personaggi secondari: Sono in tutto sette. In ordine abbiamo, i genitori adottivi (inutili), due saffiche (inutili), la bitch della scuola (inutile), il terzo lato del triangolo che si rivela un abuser (inutile, perché ancora una volta gli abusi vengono usati come escamotage per mandare avanti il romance), l’amica dell’orfanotrofio che fa diventare il triangolo un quadrato (inutile ma accettabile, perché é l’unico personaggio che in questo libro si sopporta.) - Sui genitori non ho molto da dire, sono pressoché assenti e quando ci sono servono a fare battute tristi e a cucinare o vendere fiori. - La bitch della scuola, di cui ho totalmente rimosso il nome, c’è per due capitoli e serve a far suonare nella testa di Nica i campanelli d’allarme della gelosia. - Le uniche due amiche che Nica si fa sono due saffiche la cui storia viene buttata in mezzo al libro per circa due capitoli buoni e poi abbandonata. Una é innamorata ma non ha fatto coming out e l’altra non ha capito niente; purtroppo questa pseudo inclusivitá fa da contorno del contorno. Il tutto si risolve in pochissimi capitoli con nessun tipo di sensibilità sull’argomento. - L’amica dell’orfanotrofio, Adeline, è l’unico personaggio sopportabile. Il suo unico scopo é mettere un po’ di zizzania facendoci credere che sarà un problema tra i protagonisti ma per il resto é innocua. Oltre a questo serve a mandare minimamente avanti la trama rivelando finalmente che qualcuno dei bambini in orfanotrofio ha cantato sugli abusi. - Il ragazzo che prova ad abusare di Nica si chiama Leonard (o Leopold?), e devo dire che per quanto l’autrice abbia provato a farcelo detestare non é tanto peggio di Rigel. Anche lui la pedina, anche lui le fa cose che lei non ha chiesto. (vedi: il protagonista che le entra in camera e le fa dei succhiotti mentre dorme. é normale? no. mi interessa che sia il protagonista? NO.) L’ambientazione: É inutile. Questo libro é ambientato in Michigan ma la storia potrebbe anche svolgersi in pianura padana per la qualità delle descrizioni. Sappiamo che c’è un fiume (quale? boh), due case, una scuola e un ponte da cui i protagonisti cadono, FINE. Il che mi ha stupito, perché nel libro che Matilde (l’autrice usa uno pseudonimo) ha scritto prima, le descrizioni del Canada erano non male, seppur prolisse come al suo solito.Tra l’altro sembra una storia completamente fuori dal mondo. I personaggi si comportano come sociopatici e pur avendo due genitori adottivi che lavorano stabilmente ricevono come telefoni dei modelli con I TASTI? Evidentemente non bastavano le lucertole ma servivano i telefoni del paleolitico per far sembrare Nica ancora più piccola fiammiferaia. Niente sembra realistico, partendo dai pensieri dei protagonisti, passando alle ambientazioni, al modo in cui tutti i personaggi dialogano. (I dialoghi sono la parte peggiore, ma in generale lo stile di scrittura é cosí artificioso che viene da pensare che l’autrice si sia mangiata un libro di poesie discutibili e le abbia vomitate in prosa.) In generale? Questo libro non ha né capo né coda e mi viene da supporre che sia finita così perché l’autrice aveva un po’ troppe pretese che si sono risolte male. La trama é sconnessa e vuota fino agli ultimi capitoli (anche questi discutibili) il libro in sé voleva essere un po’ vago e misterioso, un po’ un bully romance in stile Penelope Douglas e un po’ rifarsi alle favole.SPOILER Il risultato é un mattone infinito senza una storia portante (ma prima di pubblicarlo lo ha letto un editor?) che si compone di episodi sconnessi e discutibili quali: il protagonista che la bullizza ammazzandole delle farfalle davanti e tirandole i codini a sette anni, il protagonista che picchia chi le parla, il protagonista che le fa i succhiotti mentre lei é ignara, il protagonista che le sussurra all’orecchio al buio da dietro, loro che entrano in bagno quando l’altro si sta facendo la doccia, loro che cadono da un burrone insieme e lui che sconfigge il coma (pur avendo una malattia cerebrale rarissima) perché lei andava lí a leggergli le favole. Il tutto condito con questi accenni agli abusi che i bambini ricevevano in orfanotrofio e che servono a questa storia come la maionese nell’insalata di riso. Onestamente rivorrei davvero il tempo che ci ho sprecato indietro.",1.0
122,Fairy Tale,Fantasy,"Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder. Because within the shed is a portal to another world—one whose denizens are in peril and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the amusement of the “Fair One.” And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time. A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King’s work, Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero’s role by circumstance, and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.","2 stars for a Stephen King book. Yeah, I know. This lackluster rating certainly hurts me more than it hurts King. Death, taxes and King’s storytelling skills are what are supposed to be life’s certainties, right? But — I knew I was in trouble when at 82% I was sure that I could put this book down and not care at all what happens in the end - even though I quite liked the first 1/3 of the story. And it’s not because this book is terrible - although King wrote a few real stinkers throughout his long prolific career, this isn’t quite one of them. It’s just that it left me not even as much bored as quite indifferent, and that’s a cardinal sin for a book.
 “Stories. An endless number of stories that pour into the funnel and come out in our world, barely changed.”
It feels like two books tacked together. The one I liked: a slice-of-life story about a teen boy who befriends a dying old man and his dog and sacrifices his last year of high school to become a caretaker. And the one that did not click with me: a story of a bland teen boy inheriting a passage to a version of fairyland where evil has taken a firm hold. The magic here fizzles out the moment magic world takes center stage.Conclusion: If you want to read a Stephen King book about a boy in a twisted version of Fairyland, read The Talisman instead. 
“In some ways those were good months. I felt useful, needed. I liked myself better than I had in a long time. Only the end was terrible.” If you are new to King, don’t start here. King’s forte is his supernaturally good storytelling skills and a great ear for dialogue, as well as his uncanny ability to take the most mundane things and make them both magical and unsettling. But what we get here instead is an adequate serviceable story that never rises above just that: a promising intro that leads into a fairly generic dark fantasy adventure of the Chosen One - Emerald City, commoners worshipping royalty, a lovely princess, undead henchmen and a Lovecraftian Big Baddie anticlimactically defeated. And no, it doesn’t turn into something better in the end. It does exactly what it says on a tin: it gives you a fairytale adventure, and not a shred more, and then just fizzles out. A lot of buildup and foreshadowing that led exactly nowhere, with no payoff and little below the surface. And the overall feel is that of a Young Adult novel that’s trying to be edgy.(Maybe I shouldn’t have been reading this in parallel with what I consider King’s best - the still amazing after a gagillion rereads It).It seems that King’s hook for readers this time is an adorable old dog. If you are a pet person, the one who’d seriously consider risking their life for the sake of a pet, he’s got your attention for a good chunk of this story. But, well, maybe the issue is that I’m more of a pet rock person, and that I need more than a lovely old dog to make me care.
 “Sure,’ Bertie said. ‘Monster dog. Like Cujo in that movie. Riii-ight.”



From a different author it would have been a decent effort, although still nothing special. But I know what King can do with books, and this makes Fairy Tale even more lackluster than it would have been had I been a newcomer to his ouvre. That’s one of the few times when those 600 pages actually felt much too long.2 stars. I’m still King’s Constant Reader and devoted fan, but this mediocre book is easily forgettable.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0
123,This is How You Lose the Time War,Science Fiction,"Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandant finds a letter. It reads: Burn before reading. Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, grows into something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.Except the discovery of their bond would mean death for each of them. There's still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win that war.","‘I want to be a context for you, and you for me.’There is something uniquely affecting when love is painted against the backdrop of the limitlessness of space and time. The effect has been done many times over but nothing can prepare you for the extraordinary beauty in which This is How You Lose the Time War allows you to experience love stretching out and weaving across time and dimensions to examine just how infinite it can possibly be. A spark of emotion that shines through galaxies reduced to dust, the countless rises and falls of mortal empires, the lifespans of all human feats and follies. Co-written by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, each writing one of the two protagonists, the novel is a soaring epistalatory sapphic romance between two rival time-traveling agents in a war between their respective societies to control and rewrite the multiverse in order to eradicate the other. Spawn by a private battlefield provocation, the two agents become caught in a maelstrom of self-discovery and romance corresponding by letters as they chase each other across time and space in a playful and imaginative novel so searingly beautiful the cosmos can barely contain it.These two authors have created something charmingly original in Time War, enhanced by the distinct dueling voices of the authors as their prose communicates and responds to each other along with their characters. Many of these letters, particularly in the novel’s latter half, blossom into pure ethereal poetry. On occasion it dips into purple prose, as one letter admits, however, what a clever sentiment for a profession of love between characters named Red and Blue to evolve into purple. The writing remains crisp, rotating between short narration and the correspondence between the two, allowing the narrative to progress as strongly on wings of emotion as it does the chain of events. What transpires is often intentionally vague as no time is wasted on much exposition or explanation, but fully immerses you in a world you won’t quite grasp or understand. It’s as if this gorgeous landscape of the multiverse were simply a blur as you are focused on the interaction between Red and Blue, much the way the world around you fades from focus in the first moments of love.Ultimately, any attempt at concreteness in a universe in a constant state of flux and revision would be beside the point, and the vagueness reflects that. It is only though the shared connection between Red and Blue that we can find a stable focal point as they pass through a kaleidoscope of time. Much like the way the pair gives context to one another, our only context is through them as well. They are each other’s only tether to stability in an unstable reality.‘When did it happen? Or has it always happened? Like your victory, love spreads back through time.’Entire multi-dimensions are shifted, burned or woven together on the battlefield of time between Garden, an organic and collectivist society from which Blue has grown, and Agency, a post-singularity mechanical society that created Red. They are locked in an eternal time-war of which the specifics and origins of are rarely addressed and even then are quite vague. The novel makes reference to Romeo and Juliet in narrative and thematically (the play, it is said, has different endings in each strand of time), and shares it’s notion of a long-standing feud where all existing players have forgotten why but continue to play it out to the point of extreme violence. What they are doing exactly is a bit elusive but strands are altered by, say, helping a city build a port or ensuring a mathematical formula survives the destruction of Atlantis: little things that add up over centuries to create wholly different versions of reality that are fought over.‘In the war they wage through time, what lasting advantage comes from murdering ghosts, who, with a slight shift of threads, will return to life or live different lives that never bright them to the executioner’s blade?...No death sticks but the one that matters.’ ‘What a microcosm we are of the war as a whole, you and I,’ Blue writes to Red early on, ‘An action and an equal and opposite reaction.’ The two women--they identify as she/her and can take on human form though you’d be hard pressed to form a definite image of what they look like based on the various hints--who’s designation as Red and Blue help to impress an idea as mere players in a game, are equals of one another, rivals ever, which is the initial attraction between the them. ‘They were separate, they did not speak, but each shaped the other, even as they were shaped in turn.’ What begins as a game of hunter and hunted in boasting and taunting letters quickly gives way to deep conversations about the self that makes them aware they have an agency beyond their respective Agencies and despite being weapons of war have a taste for the finer and beautiful things in life. In those moments they realize there is a hole inside them that only the other can fill. And as their love grows, they begin to wonder--partly due to the millenia of time they criss-cross during their budding attraction--if perhaps the love didn’t just arrive but had always been there. As with any sci-fi involving time travel, there is the inevitable paradox of events and free-will within a shifting reality and the two authors harness this paradox into their novel towards an exquisite and emotional end.‘There’s a kind of time travel in letters, isn’t there?’‘Letters are structures, not events,’ Red writes to Blue, ‘Yours give me a place to live inside.’ This beautiful refuge from war they’ve found in their secret correspondence also becomes a commentary on language and communication itself. In whimsical sci-fi nature, they write in abstract languages found in reading the structure of leaves on a plant or decoding rings on a tree (just let it happen, it’s super cool), which reflects the way the tools of writing shape how we write--a topic often written upon by philosopher Jacques Derrida. Their secret letters envelope the secrecy of their relationship and dangers they face even reading letters from the enemy, which is fascinating to think of considering a digital age where communication can occur through images (entire conversations can be had with emojis and memes) or other non-alphabetic communication. In our modern world we continue to embrace non-verbal communication that relationships can be built from, such as how with online dating many people exist only in messages to one another before meeting and form an attraction that way. It is a beautiful notion to consider how through just our words we can fall in love with the essence of another by showing an understanding, empathy and passion for the thoughts of each other (when I first met my partner we met in person only three times before she moved back to Ireland so for months we got to know each other through long late night texting and her sending me letters, so love across distance has always spoken to me pretty well). Messages written at one place in time, sent, and received in another transmitting emotions across time and space. ‘Books are letters in bottles,’ one letter reads, ‘cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.’ All books are love letters, if you think about it. One person sending out a message in hopes someone will understand and understand them in turn, an abstract connection that reaches even beyond the grave. There is a voyeuristic sense to this novel--reading their letters and all--but it reminds us of our primal instincts that desire connection and the fireworks of emotion that come from first contact with it. It is nearly impossible to not be swept up in their romance and feel their fears, pains, and needs standing naked and unafraid before one another, like a tree in winter unashamed of it’s gnarled limbs. ‘Love is what we have, against time and death, against all the powers ranged to crush us down.’There is a subtle shadow of dread cast across their saga keeping the reader keenly aware that their taboo relationship is always threatened by the larger world in which they exist. Agency traces Blue’s exploits and wishes to set a trap for her, one Red will be used to ensure the success of the mission. Betrayal exists in the peripheries of this novel at all times, especially when they begin to open up hoping this isn’t just some long con. Poison is an important theme throughout the novel, with the women taunting each other that any letter could be laced with it and choosing to read forward anyways. It reminds us of how we remove our armor and open ourselves up to pain when we choose to love. War begets death and suffering, and the two players have entered into this affair knowing the risks but plunging on ahead regardless. ‘I want to meet you in every place I have loved.’It is difficult to say much more without spoiling anything in this clever plotted novel. It is one that encourages an immediate reread, as clues and puzzle pieces are weaved into the novel much like the way our heroines weave space and time together for their purposes. It is an extraordinary little book that somehow manages to never feel like a gimmick despite it’s inventive and quirky nature. Time, place, love, and war all become a potent concoction for one of the most tender and vulnerable romances I’ve ever read. I could praise it all day long but, as is written in one of the cosmic letters, ‘I am the songbird running out of air, and I must breathe.’4.5/5‘I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together.’",5.0
124,Tress of the Emerald Sea,Fantasy,"The only life Tress has known on her island home in an emerald-green ocean has been a simple one, with the simple pleasures of collecting cups brought by sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend Charlie. But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death?","4.5/5 starsTress of the Emerald Sea was simply whimsical and wonderful. Starting the year 2023 with the first secret novel from The Year of Sanderson is the correct action for me.
“Even small actions have consequences. And while we can often choose our actions, we rarely get to choose our consequences.”
The time is here. The first of the four awaited secret project novels, Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson is here. If you're active in the fantasy community, or even if you're not, it is no longer news that Sanderson has shocked the world with the immense success of his four secret novels Kickstarter campaign. I mean, number one most pledged Kickstarter campaign of all time; it doesn’t get more successful than that. And it shouldn’t also come as a shock that I, as a longtime fan of his Cosmere novels, end up enjoying Tress of the Emerald Sea. I wanted to start my year with a great book, and choosing this book as the first novel of 2023 (as I said) was the right pick. Sanderson plus a full-length Cosmere novel is a formula that never ceases to impress me. What I did not expect, however, was just how visually beautiful Tress of the Emerald Sea would be. I am pleasantly surprised. I am glad the past Petrik decided to buy four premium hardcover editions of the secret novels, and I am eternally thankful to my co-blogger, TS, for covering the expense of the shipping fee. Without TS, I do not think I would cave into buying the premium hardcover editions, and I would regret it so much. I will go into more details on this later, but at $40 per secret novel (not counting the shipping fee) and for everything we get, this special edition can be considered, relatively, a bargain. This is on top of it being such a fun and cozy book to read.
“Leaving didn’t feel exciting. It felt heavy. Every child looked forward to the day when they could choose a different path from the one their parents were on. Tress sincerely hoped she hadn’t decided on one that led straight off a cliff.”
All her life on an island named The Rock in the emerald-green ocean, Tress lived a simple life with the simple pleasures of collecting cups received from sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend, Charlie. But when Charlie’s father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must leave her simple life to stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Although I expected to love this book, I was initially worried after reading the first few chapters. Note the word ship in the official premise. Sailing and seafaring dominated the majority of Tress of the Emerald Sea. Personally, I tend to have mixed feelings about fantasy books with a heavy focus on seafaring unless they're The Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb and The Tide Child trilogy by R.J. Barker. And there were indeed some sections here where I felt a bit of a lull because of this. However, my overall experience was fun. Most of the time, it was difficult for me to stay away from the book. Sanderson's prose and the relatively short length of the novel, plus its short chapters, made it easy for me to steal-read one or two chapters whenever I had some free time. This was a delightful book about human beings, contradictions, leadership, found family, stories, love, bravery, and empathy.
“It might seem that the person who can feel for others is doomed in life. Isn’t one person’s pain enough? Why must a person like Tress feel for two, or more? Yet I’ve found that the people who are the happiest are the ones who learn best how to feel. It takes practice, you know. Effort. And those who (late in life) have been feeling for two, three, or a thousand different people… well, turns out they’ve had a leg up on everyone else all along. Empathy is an emotional loss leader. It pays for itself eventually.”
Before reading Tress of the Emerald Sea, I did not read any of the secret novel preview chapters. However, based on the known artists and the title or premise of the four novels, Tress of the Emerald ranked third out of four. I am interested in all four, but I am most excited about the third and fourth secret novels. Based on these, the first two secret novels felt like they would be the most tonally different from Sanderson's other Cosmere books. Having read all published Cosmere stories, including this one, I can convey that Tress of the Emerald Sea has proved it. Sanderson has mentioned that The Princess Bride is one of the main inspirations behind this book. Another good comparison for what kind of tone you're getting here is Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman. So it is time to admit something. I haven't read or watched The Princess Bride yet, but I have watched Good Omens. And I think Sanderson nailed the comparison he's going for. The storytelling is whimsical and light-hearted in tone but also imbued with clever philosophical nuggets and serious themes occasionally. I loved the novel for it. I don't think I would've liked it this much if it was just all fun and joy all the way through. Sanderson's comedy, especially when the narrative involves young adult characters, doesn't land well with me often. But his hard-hitting and thought-provoking passages? That's another story. Sanderson may not have flowery prose, but the words he put on the pages of his novel frequently hit and became passages I think about daily. A few examples from this book are:
“While a healthy measure of foolhardiness drove our ancestors toward discovery, fear kept them alive. If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.”
And also these two long passages about memories.
“Beyond that, memories have a way of changing on us. Souring or sweetening over time— like a brew we drink, then recreate later by taste, only getting the ingredients mostly right. You can’t taste a memory without tainting it with who you have become. That inspires me. We each make our own lore, our own legends, every day. Our memories are our ballads, and if we tweak them a little with every performance… well, that’s all in the name of good drama.”

“Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again. Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing— like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure— we make of our memories the gods which judge our current lives. I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it’s at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We’re happy, sure, but were we more happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of our past… Do not let memory chase you. Take the advice of one who has dissected the beast, then rebuilt it with a more fearsome face— which I then used to charm a few extra coins out of an inebriated audience. Enjoy memories, yes, but don’t be a slave to who you wish you once had been. Those memories aren’t alive. You are.”
Although possible, it wouldn't feel organic to have these kinds of passages appearing throughout the book if the novel is told through the first-person or third-person perspective of Tress. These were effective because the entire story in Tress of the Emerald Sea is narrated through Hoid's perspective. Hoid is an integral character in Sanderson's Cosmere universe. And we, Cosmere fans, are all waiting for Hoid's origin story. Sanderson mentioned he wanted to practice and be more fluent at writing Hoid's perspective before that backstory novel happened, and this is the book where it came to fruition. This won't, however, be how the story is told eventually in Hoid's backstory novel. It will definitely be less whimsical. But to give you an idea of the kind of voice Sanderson is giving Hoid in this book, if you've read The Stormlight Archive series, this is more in tune with the unforgettable ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon"" stories Hoid told in the series. A full-length version of that kind of in-world story. I absolutely loved ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon,"" and obviously, I ended up loving Tress of the Emerald Sea as well.
“Worldbringers like myself spend decades combing through folk tales, legends, myths, histories, and drunken bar songs looking for the most unique stories. We hunt for bravery, cleverness, heroism. And we find no shortage of such virtues. Legends are silly with them. But the person who is willing to reconsider their assumptions? The hero who can sit down and reevaluate their life? Well, now that is a gemstone that truly glitters, friend.”
So yes, we get to learn more about Hoid and the Cosmere (more on this in the next paragraph) inside this book. But at the end of the day, even though this is told through Hoid's perspective, Tress of the Emerald Sea is still a standalone story about Tress and her adventures. I mentioned The Stormlight Archive earlier, and I am no stranger to voicing how much I love the Bridge Four group in the series. The found family trope is one of the many things Sanderson executed extremely well in The Stormlight Archive and the first Mistborn trilogy. And he managed to craft another cherishable found family in this book. Tress, Huck, Fort, Salay, and all the characters are well-written and likable characters. The Deaf character representation was written with the help of a special sensitivity reader to do it justice, too. And hey, for the first time in the Cosmere, we finally get to see a real dragon. As Tress and the crew of the ship she's in face danger constantly, the bonds between them grow deeper and deeper. My investment in them, too. And upon reaching the last page, I can't help but hope we will get more stories or appearances from these characters eventually. Knowing how connected with each other the Cosmere is now, I'm confident we will.
“She… didn’t need to do this all on her own. That shouldn’t have been such a revelation for her. But after spending ages walking around with everyone piling bricks in your arms, it can throw you off balance when someone removes a brick to carry for you.”
Speaking of Cosmere connections, and because people will ask me this question, should you read other Cosmere books first? Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story in the world of Lumar. This marks the first time we get a book taking place in this world in the Cosmere. Like always, it is not necessary to read the other Cosmere books first to enjoy the main story here. But will you benefit from reading them? Yes, you will. I talk about this already in my review of The Lost Metal. But moving forward, Sanderson's future publications in the Cosmere universe, especially the ones taking place after book 5 of The Stormlight Archive, will most likely have heavy Cosmere crossovers. If you intend to read all of Sanderson's Cosmere books, it is a good idea to start catching up reading them if you want to reap all the connections. As for this book, reading the entirety of The Mistborn Saga so far will be beneficial. Additionally, there were a few small nods to the magic or technology portrayed in Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Stormlight Archive. I will leave it to you to decide whether you want to read them first or not. There is no spoiler for these three series. Also, although not the primary planet of the magic and there is no main novel for it yet, aethers and its explosive potential are explored here.
“Now, most people would agree that humans are not telepathic. We can’t directly send our thoughts or emotions into the minds of others. Nevertheless, you can hear my story and imagine the things I describe—the same as I picture them in my own mind. What is that, if not a form of telepathy?”
One more thing before I end this review. I will update this once I have the physical copy, but right now, even the ebook of the premium edition alone is exquisitely made. Unless the paper quality of the physical copy sucks, which is so doubtful, I can vouch that the $40 I spent on getting this book is well spent. Maybe too well spent. It is almost ridiculous. You won’t get a premium/special edition like this with only $40 anywhere else. If Subterranean Press or Grim Oak Press publishes a book like this, I guarantee it will cost at least $200 (not counting the shipping fee and customs fee yet). The stunning design and the more than ten interior artworks (four fully colored art and the rest in green-toned black and white) by Howard Lyon enhanced the quality of the aesthetic and the tale. They are magnificent. And I am brimming with excitement waiting for the physical copy to arrive at my place. And if the first secret novel already reaches this level of production value, I want to read and find out what the other three will look like. Rest assured, in this review, I leave out some surprises in the clever design and artwork inside this book for you to find out for yourself.
“One of the great tragedies of life is knowing how many people in the world are made to soar, paint, sing, or steer— except they never get the chance to find out.”
Whether aesthetically or narrative-wise, Tress of the Emerald Sea provided a whimsical and wonderful reading experience. It is a refreshing addition to the Cosmere universe. And it is essentially (at least, it read like one) a Cosmere version of an adult fairy tale. With the success of the secret projects, some readers might think Sanderson favors quantity instead of quality in his books recently. It is up to you to think that way, but I can't voice the same sentiment. Personally speaking, Tress of the Emerald Sea doesn't show any drop in storytelling quality. Every book in the Cosmere, including this that he wrote in secret, works amazingly well for me. Similarly to the first Mistborn trilogy, even though this is undoubtedly a different kind of book, I think Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story that can be enjoyed by both YA or adult fantasy readers. Making this even more appealing to a bigger audience. This is a superb first book of 2023 for me, and I hope this signals the positive trajectory of my reading year. I look forward to receiving the physical copy and reading the next secret novel.
“The first is that heroes can be trained. Not by a government or a military, but by the people themselves. Heroes are the ones who have thought about what they’re going to do, and who have trained to do it. Heroism is often the seemingly spontaneous result of a lifetime of preparation… In the frenzied anarchy of destruction, loyalty to causes and kingdoms alike tends to fall to the chaos. But the bond between people, well, that’s stronger than steel. If you want to create heroes, don’t give them something to fight for. Give them someone to fight for.”

Revealing a deeper look into the dramatic life of Elfhame’s enigmatic high king, Cardan, his tale includes delicious details of life before The Cruel Prince, an adventure beyond The Queen of Nothing, and familiar moments from The Folk of the Air trilogy, told wholly from Cardan’s perspective.This new installment in the Folk of the Air series is a return to the heart-racing romance, danger, humor, and drama that enchanted readers everywhere. Each chapter is paired with lavish and luminous full-color art, making this the perfect collector’s item to be enjoyed by both new audiences and old.","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★2.) The Wicked King ★★★★★3.) The Queen of Nothing ★★★★★


""Hate that was so bright and hot that it was the first thing that truly warmed him.""


How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories is an illustrated novella following Cardan Greenbriar, during many different stages in his life, while we slowly see all the different things that shaped him cruelly. The sound that left me when I opened this book and realized we were going to get present day with Jude from Cardan’s POV… be still, my hopes and dreams and heart.Rovina Cai’s art is truly so beautiful that it renders me speechless. I was already in love with her and her art because of her work with 
The Wayward Children
 series, but this entire book feels like am immersive work of art. From the perfect color palette, to the most perfect details, she executes the vibe of Cardan and his story in a way that I don’t think another artist could.In this story, Cardan’s life is very much impacted by a troll named Aslong who was wronged by Cardan’s father. She tells a story about a boy with a heart of stone, who finds himself in a predicament with a monster girl who won’t scare him away, until his heart starts beating again. And then all throughout his life, she tells his alternate versions of this same story, each version with a new meaning for a new version of Cardan himself.


""She was the only real thing in a land of ghosts.""


We also get to see so much of Cardan’s perspective during 
The Cruel Prince
, much like we did with Tarryn in 
The Lost Sisters
, and it was everything. Nicasia and Locke have much wanted character development in this book, too, and I am literally on my knees begging for Holly to just give us the trilogy in Cardan’s complete point of view. But we see Nicasia being fostered on the land because her mother, Orlagh, Queen of the Undersea, wants to start putting pieces in motion. We get to see Locke, and his empty house and even emptier heart, teach Cardan the word “cruel” on every page. And these two, in addition to a prophecy looming over this young prince, are truly the first catalysts to this story and I was so in love seeing behind the scenes. And when Holly gives us Locke’s perspective one of these years…


""Playing the villain was the only thing he’d ever really excelled at.""


Each part, each mini story, we get to see Cardan questioning who he is and who he wants to be. Not to make this too deep, but Cardan very slowly realizes that he is not responsible for the terrible acts his family committed; both to him and to the people they ruled over. He struggles with his identity of a prince who should feel like he has everything, and a boy who feels like he has nothing. But seeing him finally understand that he deserves not only love but unconditional love? Him slowly appreciating that his heart can be warm and beat unapologetically? Truly some powerful stuff.On a personal note, I think most of you know that Holly Black is an author who means a lot to me. Her fae stories are what first got me into YA when I was young, and it really changed me as a reader and probably a human as well. I know most of you know that 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and everything, very much including my reading, so being able to curl up and read about my emotional support fae, from my emotional support author, just meant a lot to me. I truly think reading this book a day before release (bless you Waterstones and my mail person) was the best reading experience I’ve had all year, and for that alone this book was probably the easiest five star I’ve given in a year of not a lot of five star reads.


""Feels as though she has to earn the crown on her head over and over again.""


Overall, this felt like the fairytale of my dreams. Cardan is my favorite character in 
The Cruel Prince
 series (or any of Holly’s books, I think) and this truly was such a magical, wonderous, unforgettable addition to this world. I am incredibly biased over this series because so much of my heart and nostalgia are wrapped up within this world, but I honestly think there is just so much to love on every page of this book. I feel blessed to read about each time Holly gives us a new book, and this will for sure be a favorite of mine for all of 2020. Lastly, I cannot believe we really got to read about Cardan going out for boba.Content & Trigger Warnings: abandonment, bullying, abuse, mention of drug use, humiliation, talk of cheating, and a lot of drinking.

127,The Chalice of the Gods,Fantasy,"Percy Jackson, modern-day son of Poseidon, is just trying to get through high school. After saving the world multiple times by battling monsters, Titans, and giants, Percy is now settling in at Alternative High School in New York, where he hopes to finally have a normal senior year. Unfortunately, the gods aren’t quite done with him yet. Poseidon breaks the bad news that if Percy expects to get into New Rome University, he will have to fulfill three quests in order to earn the necessary three letters of recommendation from Mount Olympus. The first task is to help Ganymede, Zeus’s cupbearer, retrieve his golden goblet before it falls into the wrong hands. You see, one sip from it can turn a mortal into a god, and Zeus would not be pleased with that result. Can Percy and his friends Grover and Annabeth find the precious cup in time? And if they do, will they be able to resist its special power?Readers new to Percy Jackson universe and fans who have been awaiting this reunion for more than a decade will delight equally in this latest hilarious take on Greek mythology by the ""storyteller of the gods.""","""Sitting down is easy. Getting up, not so much.""The nostalgia is so sweet with this one. I've had a pretty tough week, and boy was it perfect timing to be able to go on an adventure with Percy Jackson again. He was my very first best friend, and the comfort I felt turning every page of this will not be forgotten. Even if it feels like Rick will never leave me alone, his words will always be something I pine after. He knows how to drive a story home!Every page of this felt like a throwback to a core memory we built together as a group of kids just wanting to go on an adventure. All of Percy's greatest hits lay before us so we could reminisce, and be reminded what it felt like to be a kid again. We're all grown up, and while Percy is still a teenager, he grew up with us, too. He's always had the sarcasm of his age and the courage to never actually act that way. With a Mom like Sally, how could he ever be anything but wise beyond his years? With Annabeth by his side, is it truly possible to be anything but special?He's never really been given a break to be a kid. Being a half blood doesn't allow you the luxury. I'm almost thankful for it after reading this book simply because he learned so much faster than anyone else that growing up is the most important thing you can do in your life. Loving people, getting to live life beside them, that's the point.Percy doesn't need anyone else to point that out for him, he knew it when the Gods gifted him immortality and he said no. But this book was a nice reminder that no matter what he does in his life, no matter how many monsters he must fight, the goal will always be to keep going with Annabeth and Grover. How sweet is that?How did he grow up so fast? How is he going to be a big brother (we knew that). How on earth is he smarter, more caring, more understanding that anyone has ever given him credit for? I love that even when he's fighting monsters, he still tries to give them the benefit of the doubt and a chance. That he deals with Gods thousands of years old, and will always give them a chance to change their ways even when they absolutely do not deserve it.He's a golden drachma if I've ever known one. I can't wait to see where his next search for a college letter will take him.",5.0
128,The Brothers Hawthorne,Mystery,"Two missions. One explosive read. Jennifer Lynn Barnes returns to the world of her #1 bestselling Inheritance Games trilogy, and the stakes have never been higher.    Grayson Hawthorne was raised as the heir apparent to his billionaire grandfather, taught from the cradle to put family first. Now the great Tobias Hawthorne is dead and his family disinherited, but some lessons linger. When Grayson’s half-sisters find themselves in trouble, he swoops in to do what he does best: take care of the problem—efficiently, effectively, mercilessly. And without getting bogged down in emotional entanglements.  Jameson Hawthorne is a risk-taker, a sensation-seeker, a player of games. When his mysterious father appears and asks for a favor, Jameson can’t resist the challenge. Now he must infiltrate London’s most exclusive underground gambling club, which caters to the rich, the powerful, and the aristocratic, and win an impossible game of greatest stakes. Luckily, Jameson Hawthorne lives for impossible.   Drawn into twisted games on opposite sides of the globe, Grayson and Jameson—with the help of their brothers and the girl who inherited their grandfather’s fortune—must dig deep to decide who they want to be and what each of them will sacrifice to win.","Was this my most anticipated read of the year?  Heck yes.   Was I disappointed?  Extremely. Before I start this review I just want to make it clear I love this series and characters so much. I still recommend the first three books in the series. They are so worth investing your time in. This one? Not so much. It started off really well. The four brothers together, talking and bonding. I was really entertained for the first 60-70 pages and then it went downhill. The  pacing is slow. Firstly let me start by saying  Nash and Xander  are really vital and core members of this series and the lack of them makes an immense impact. Nash and Xander both provide a sense of unity, balance, family and peace into Grayson and Jameson's chaos. I missed the two so much in this one. It was a terrible mistake on JLB's part to kick the two out of the book. Secondly, the  dynamic between Grayson, Avery and Jameson  completely fell. The three act like they no longer know each other. There are so few scenes of the three together it's just strange. Grayson and Jameson deserved more scenes together. They are no longer rivals stuck in a love triangle. Coming to the  ""love aspect"".  Those who haven't read the series yet, might want to skip past these few sentences.   Jameson and Avery were so amazing in the last book together. They had such good growth and Jameson was shining. Here, they had zero chemistry. Sure, they had like two good scenes together but the rest of the book they act like they are strangers? It is so weird. Grayson and Avery still have better chemistry. It hurts to see my man is still hung up on her. There clearly lies more in store for  Grayson.  His story is not complete and this was the sole reason for this book. But while doing so, am not sure what JLB was trying to achieve. He is broken. Hung up over so many girls who betrayed him so many times. He stood up to Eve towards the end and opened up to his brothers but his character needs more. There was no healing for him. Hopefully that gets rectified in the next book.  A major problem was the fact that JLB wrote the story in a very confusing manner.  We get Grayson and Jameson's POV. Both have missions of their own. Jameson's mission in particular served no major purpose. His character deserves better than that. Apart from two different missions, we get flashbacks in between which just makes things worse. The back and forth along with different pov started to make things unnecessarily complicated. No doubt JLB is a talented writer but she made a lot of mistakes in this. The way  this book has not much to offer and is written in such a boring manner makes it comes across as written purely for the purpose of money grab.  This book easily could have been a novella, 200 pages short but it dragged on in a miserable way. It surely reads like a novella but is a proper book. The only reason I will read the next book is for the fact am not ready to give up on Grayson yet. ~•~•~LET'S GOOOO. Justice for my bae~.~.~Justice for Grayson Hawthorne or I sue.",2.0
129,The Institute,Horror,"In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win.--front flap","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects… Harry Potter himself!","“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” CHILLS.(REREAD)Okay DUH 5/5 stars. I actually liked this book more than I remembered! This used to be my least favorite of the Harry Potter books and, while that still might be true, I was more entertained than I expected! I always forget how different Book Ginny is from Movie Ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films.NOW ONTO HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!",5.0
132,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Fantasy,"Harry Potter, along with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry can't wait to get back to school after the summer holidays. (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, and the sinister prison guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school...","I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0
133,The Hobbit,Fantasy,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).","Some books are almost impossible to review. If a book is bad, how easily can we dwell on its flaws! But if the book is good, how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book? Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review, what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work? 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. There, see how simple that was? If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. At some level, there is little more to say. Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.But if it was only simple entertainment, I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book. Instead, this simple children's story resonates and fascinates. It teases and hints at something larger and grander, and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing, lecturing or being condescending.At its heart, the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in 'The Hobbit' when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told, but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof. How often has that idea fascinated me.Consider also how the story opens, with Bilbo's breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit, and Gandalf's continual meditation on the meaning of 'Good morning.’ How much insight is concealed within Gandalf's gentle humor! How often do we find ourselves, like Bilbo, saying something we don't really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning! How often do we find ourselves saying, ""I don't mean to be rude, but..."", when in fact we mean, ""I very much mean to be rude, and here it comes!"" If we did not mean to be rude, surely we wouldn't say what we say. Instead we mean, ""I'm going to be rude but I don't want you to think I'm someone who is normally rude..."", or ""I'm going to put myself forward, but I don't want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant..."", or even, ""I'm going to be rude, but I don't want to think of myself as someone who is rude, so I'm going to pretend I'm not being rude...""I think that is what makes this more than just a good book, but a great one. Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings, and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or self-loathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings. We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form, and we have for as long as we've had recorded literature. Our comic books are filled with those neo-pagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to, whatever else may be true of them, 'beats people up good'. These modern Ajaxs, Helens and Achilles dominate the box office, and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well. Oh sure, the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt, attract the opposite sex, and enforce their will upon others, but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility. How different is Tolkien's protagonist from Heracles, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman - short, small, mundane, and weak. Of all the principal characters of the story, he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute - martial prowess.And yet, he is not actually merely an 'average Joe'. Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles, it's just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isn't the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves. Bilbo is gentle. He is simple. He is humble. Power and wealth have little attraction for him. He is kind. He takes less than his share, and that that he takes he gives away. He is a peacemaker. Though wrongly imprisoned, he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him. Rather he apologizes for stealing food, and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took. Though mistreated, he harbors no enmity. He never puts himself forward, but he never shirks when others do. How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero, and yet how much better we would be if we did? How much better off would we be if we, like Thorin could declare in our hearts, ""There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."" How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things? What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to 'beat people up good'? What real use could we put it too? How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbo's virtues, rather than Achilles speed, strength, and skill with arms? How much less mature does this mere children's book of a well lit-world cause our darker fantasies to seem?Now, I admit I am biased in my review. I read this book 36 times before the age of 16. I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading. Yet in my defense I will say that I'm considered only a moderate fan of the book by many. I've known several devotees of the book who, like the protagonist of Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451', can recite whole chapters from memory - ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the world's technology if only the world's story tellers survived. If you are inclined to think no book can be that good, and that my review overhypes it, so much the better. Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded. Forget all I have said save that, ""If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable.""",5.0
134,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Fantasy,"It is the summer holidays and soon Harry Potter will be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is counting the days: there are new spells to be learnt, more Quidditch to be played, and Hogwarts castle to continue exploring. But Harry needs to be careful - there are unexpected dangers lurking...","(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:03/15/2020 - Preamble(1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga.""(2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts.03/16/2020 - 2%(1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three.(2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020 - 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020 - 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020 - 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020 - 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020 - 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020 - 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020 - 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020 - 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020 - 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020 - 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020 - 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020 - 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020 - 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020 - 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020 - 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020 - 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020 - 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020 - 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020 - 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020 - 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020 - 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020 - 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020 - 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020 - 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020 - 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020 - 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020 - 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020 - 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020 - 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020 - 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020 - 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020 - 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020 - 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?""- Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite.07/05/2020 - 39%Callback/Mirroring: You've got something on your face.(1) Harry: ""The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.""- Oh the irony.(2) Hermione: ""Ron, what are you staring at?""Ron: ""Nothing.""Hermione: ""I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.""- Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old.07/06/2020 - 42%(1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang?(2) Orphanage matron: ""He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.""- Hmm... The Great Marvolo!(3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny.07/07/2020 - 44%(1) Harry: ""What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?""- Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing.(2) ""What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?""- Classic third-wheel talk right there.07/08/2020 - 46%(1) Harry: ""Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.""Ginny: ""Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.""- Can't fault the logic.(2) Ginny teases Ron for ""never snogg[ing] anyone in his life."" She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess.07/09/2020 - 48%Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot.(1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.""- Ron's not wrong, but misses the point.(2) Hermione: ""He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ...

Not useful, but it's the thought that counts.(2) '""Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.'- Most romantic maggot scene in fiction?07/13/2020 - 56%(1) ""Abstinence"" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly.(2) Harry: ""Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?""Hermione: ""No, I can't... So don't even ask.""- Can't or won't?(3) ""The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?""- Eh, only the regrettable ones.07/14/2020 - 58%(1) Hermione: ""Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ...

It would just be greater than it!(2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :)07/16/2020 - 62%(1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.""- I vote Lavender.(2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.""- Pretty passive ambition there.07/17/2020 - 64%(1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?""Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?""Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.""- Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting.07/18/2020 - 68%(1) Lavender to Ron: ""Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?""- I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends.(2) Voldemort: ""You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.""Dumbledore: ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.""- That's some stealthy foreshadowing there.07/19/2020 - 71%(1) Ron: ""I love you, Hermione.""Hermione: ""Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.""Ron: ""I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.""- Essentially, that's what happened in the film.(2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense.(3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual.07/20/2020 - 73%(1) Ron: ""Quick, hide me!""Hermione: ""It isn't Lavender!""- If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse.(2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points.- Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker.07/21/2020 - 75%(1) '""What were you doing up there with her?"" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.'- Lavender's suspicions confirmed!- Lucky all around... except Lavender.(2) Slughorn: ""Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.""- I see what she did there :)07/22/2020 - 78%(1) '""You have [uncommon skill and power],"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —""""I know!"" said Harry impatiently. ""I can love!"" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, ""Big deal!"".'- I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of ""The Fifth Element."" ""Really? Love is the greatest power there is?""07/23/2020 - 82%(1) Flitwick: ""A little less talk, a little more action.""- Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was ""A Little Less Conversation.""(2) Harry's mind: ""She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!""- Ron, Ron, Ron.07/24/2020 - 85%(1) Ginny: ""All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.""- Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho.(2) ""Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.""- Fight it! Angst was so Book 5.07/25/2020 - 86%(1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron?(2) ""Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.""- I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up?07/26/2020 - 87%(1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood!(2) Dumbldore: ""You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.""- So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic.07/27/2020 - 88%(1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining.(2) '""It's going to be all right, sir,"" Harry said over and over again ... ""Don't worry...""""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.""'- Hits me right in the feels.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

Sure, rules get thrown out when it comes to war, but do the ends justify the means?(2) In the film McGonagall duels Snape one-on-one until he flees. In the book, it's Flitwick that runs Snape off.(3) 'Professor McGonagall dryly, ""we teachers are rather good at magic, you know.""'- Ha! Sassy.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0
137,A Game of Thrones,Fantasy,"Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--and he did.In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is 'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and 'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's just written by women.Though I didn't save any choice examples, I did come across this quote from a later book:
""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""
Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters, 'they’re not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author: sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), but there's a reason we don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.I found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:
""I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... sure, he’s going to get into trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.
He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell 'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.Some say 'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin, Wolfe, Jordan, and Goodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this reviewThere seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms of racism.Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, he filled his shed with a bunch of notes (which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actually pre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just another cliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show.""My Fantasy Book Suggestions",1.0
138,The Fellowship of the Ring,Fantasy,"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.","Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's 
The Broken Sword
, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock’s 
Epic Pooh
 and Mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. He’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",3.0

Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.
The Writing
The title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to ""dance"" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.
The Worldbuilding
The Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.
The Characters
Faerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.
Conclusion
While I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",1.0

While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.","4.5/5 stars

 “It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.” 

Friendship, hope, resilience, faith, justice, and bravery; these days, good-hearted with no grey morality characters are much easier for fantasy readers to dismiss. I totally get it; this type of characters and stories have been done more than a million times in fantasy stories, and readers—myself included—sometimes prefer more complexity. However, I also personally think that these kinds of characters are still much needed in the stories we devour. Maybe even more than ever. The Two Towers, being the second part of The Lord of the Rings, touches upon these themes by transporting its readers to an old and familiar ground, which I highly enjoyed reading.I’m genuinely surprised by how fast and immersed I am with reading The Two Towers. To be honest, I never expected to find myself compelled from reading most of Tolkien’s work, but I certainly did with this one. This is surprising to me because The Two Towers have often been mentioned as being even slower and tedious than The Fellowship of the Ring by several fans of the series. There’s something about The Two Towers that worked reasonably well with me. To be clear, there’s no clear beginning and ending with this volume, but that’s also why what the characters faced in The Two Towers resonated; they’re doing whatever they can with the hope that their faith towards one another will be rewarded. Many people in this world say and believe that true faith is achieved once you believe in something that you can’t see with your eyes. After what happened at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, the main characters are plagued with doubts on whether they can succeed in completing the journey they set out to do. And yet they persevere. Honestly, what they had was only the faith that everything will maybe turn out alright if they do everything they respectively can do the best.And isn’t that what we all do in our lives?

 “War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” 

I’m also, once again, amazed at the film’s portrayal of the Battle of Helm’s Deep. Now that I’ve read the scene in the original text for the first time, I will say that what the movie did on this sequence was so much more superior to what’s written. I’m not saying that Tolkien’s Battle of Helm’s Deep was poorly written, it’s just that the movie took the best quality of the text and increased the buildup, the tensions, and the execution of the battle dramatically. Picture: The Two Towers by Jonathan BurtonIf there’s one thing that the books do better, it would be the world-building and the characterizations for Faramir and Frodo. Frodo in the movies, in my opinion, was mediocre. I liked Frodo in the book more, and I think Tolkien’s writing of Frodo and Samwise Gamgee’s friendship was wonderfully done; it’s no wonder the movie could execute their friendship to its maximum potential. I’ve been saying this since I first watched the movies, and I will repeat it again that everyone needs a Samwise Gamgee in their life.

'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. ""I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?""''Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.''So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am.” 

As for the parts that didn’t work for me, I’m going to keep this brief by saying that every single scene revolving around Merry, Pippin, Treebeards, and the Ents bored me to oblivion. Thankfully, there aren’t too many of them, but wow they totally tested my patience; their scenes were as painfully slow as the Ent’s communication with each other.Picture: Fangorn Forest by Donato GiancolaOverall, though, despite a few issues, I definitely enjoyed reading The Two Towers more than reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Not going to lie, it helps a lot that there’s no Tom Bombadil’s nonsense here. I only have one more book left, once I’m done reading The Return of the King, it would mean that I’m finally done with Middle-Earth (I’ve read Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and the three Great Tales of Middle-Earth) after all these years.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.",4.0
142,The Name of the Wind,Fantasy,"Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen. The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. A high-action story written with a poet's hand, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.","I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfuss. For realz, actual sorry. Honestly. I tried giving your book two stars out of pity, since I so wanted to like it and I'd feel bad about giving it one star and dragging down your average rating. Though you don't appear to need my pity. Your book has the highest average GR rating (4.49) of any of the book I've read. I finally dropped my rating down to one star because it's just a steaming pile of crap and I couldn't take the embarrassment of having posted a two-star rating on something so awful.Mr. Rothfuss, you probably don't give a shit about my rating since, judging from your GR biography, you appear to be very comfortable in your own academic, geeky skin. And that is totally cool. I'm an academic, geeky type myself. Not as geeky as you. You are really geeky. Like I said: that's cool. Anywayz, for a long time I gave you two stars since a couple of my most favorite people (my brother and his fiancé) both love your book. One star for each of them. But, like I hinted, the book is pretty bad. So are you and me good? No hard feelings? Awesome. I don't take shit too personally, either. So now I'll get down to ripping your book, knowing we can still be friends.In the interest of full disclosure, I faithfully admit that this book goes in my DNF shelf. I made it 162 pages in (I was reading it on the Kindle app on my iPhone and made it to § 3154, but with little arithmetic I determined that was the equivalent of page 162 in the mass market paperback). I just couldn't finish it. I gave it a good honest try and eventually found myself reading only so I wouldn't have to admit to my brother that I didn't like it enough to finish. But that isn't a good reason to spend my time—something we have precious little of in our short lives—reading something I dislike and not getting paid for it. So I'm sorry, bro. I tried. (Yes, my brother is one of my GR friends and will likely see this review.) Now on to the reasons I couldn't finish the book.Most of The Name of the Wind is written in the first person; it's the autobiography of Kvothe, who has a number of things in common with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Kvothe is reciting his life story to a scribe while his male companion, Bast, looks on.FOOTNOTEThere are several interesting facts pertaining to Kvothe and Bast. First, Bast is described as ""sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes."" Second, Kvothe and Bast run a bed-and-breakfast. Third, Bast follows Kvothe around like a puppy dog. Fourth, Bast likes to tuck Kvothe into bed and watch him sleep. Fifth, Bast cries like a little girl when he hears something sad. Finally, Bast apparently can manifest himself as some sort of goat-man creature. Do you see where I'm going with this? Kvothe runs a bed-and-breakfast, in which a very sensitive and beautiful man follows him around and occasionally turns into a goat. Bed-and-breakfast and goat-men: what could be sexier? Not that there's anything wrong with that. I believe everyone should have the freedom be who they were born to be and I have several close friends who happen to be gay; I'm the last person who would have a problem with Kvothe and his beautiful male companion getting frisky (goat-style, of course). I only mention the implied homoerotic connection because Kvothe (a.k.a. The Most Interesting Man in the World) is supposed to be a lady-killer. No, not a psycho rapist murderer, you freaks. A lady-killa. A Lover of Women. I suppose that's not necessarily inconsistent; perhaps Kvothe swings both ways. Let's all say it together, now: not that there's anything wrong with that.END FOOTNOTENot all of the book, however, is written in the first-person. First-person narrative is reserved for Kvothe's recitation of his life story. The remainder of the book, particularly the scenes of Kvothe manhandling his lover in front of the scribe (Bast said Kvothe leaves bruises), are written in the third-person. I'll address my displeasure with the third-person sections first.Let me clarify at the outset that I have no problem with the writer switching between first-person and third-person narrative. I recognize it can be a powerful tool and it serves the structure of this story quite well. The book begins in the third-person, then as Kvothe tells his life story it switches to first-person, then back to third-person for occasional interludes. My problem is with the author switching his narrative voice within the third-person sections. The academic geek is all over the place in that regard. Sometimes he writes a scene in third-person subjective, other times third-person objective. Some passages read like third-person limited, others third-person omniscient. At points the author seemed to switch voice page to page, or even paragraph to paragraph. In one especially irritating scene he even threw in a hint of first-person for a paragraph or so. Maybe if I'd kept reading I would have found a scene or two in second-person, just for good measure. The switching of narrative voices was confusing and frustrating.Perhaps the author saw his story as being so epic and/or complex that a third-person omniscient narrator was called for throughout. I certainly understand the advantages of an omniscient narrator that can relate some scenes from one character's point of view and others from a second character's point of view, and so on. But that theory doesn't fit The Name of the Wind. With most of the book, indeed the real meat of the story, being written in the first-person, the third-person sections are a minority and seem almost incidental, merely setting the stage and creating some dynamic/juxtaposition. And the theory doesn't explain why some scenes are told from the points of view of everyone present (a voice that strikes me as pompous and unreal) while other scenes are described objectively, from nobody's point of view. Still other scenes alternate points of view paragraph by paragraph, or even sentence by sentence, and at a couple of points I wasn't entirely sure who's thoughts I was reading. Such constant switching without an obvious purpose or pattern made the omniscient narrator (if that's what was intended) seem unreliable.Now on to the bulk of the book: Kvothe's first-person account of his life story. Kvothe's account actually read much smoother than the third-person interludes. Without the worry of mixing up his voices, the author did a much better job on the first-person narrative. Indeed, Kvothe's story incorporates some fair (not horrible, not great) drama, suspense, and sentiment. Portions are even quite quotable. The Author was thoughtful and observant in his telling of Kvothe's story, relating events and thoughts with which I could identify and pointing out a few things I wouldn’t have thought of. Unfortunately, for the reasons set forth below, those good qualities were not sufficient to demand my continued attention.Many passages in Kvothe's story felt lazy, unnecessary, unintended, or unoriginal. A few things were just plain weird. For example:--> Kvothe asks his father a question and the father makes a big deal about wanting to answer with a poem, but after five lines he forgets the rest. Setting aside that the five remembered lines were some shitty poetry, why is the rest forgotten? If the poem was important, then the author should have taken the time (or sought the help) to craft something decent for the father to recite. If the poem was not important, why have the father recite a poem at all? A pointless poem only serves to clutter the prose. --> As a boy Kvothe watched his parents make out so he could learn kissing technique. That's weird.--> Speaking of Kvothe watching his parents, he has some sort of Oedipal affection for his mother. It shows in a few places but never more so than when he describes his mother as ""slender, fresh, and bright, pale and smooth-skinned in the firelight."" I have trouble reconciling the Oedipus Complex with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Unless I just misunderstand one or the other?2ND FOOTNOTEWhat I find especially interesting is my suspicion that the author was not consciously creating the Oedipal attraction. Similarly I suspect the author was not consciously creating the romantic connection between Kvothe and Bast. Maybe if I'd finished the book I would have found out that Kvothe was a gay man who masturbated to the memory of his mother. But I doubt it.END 2ND FOOTNOTE--> Kvothe declares that he will ""sum up"" a certain magical principle and begins with his ""first"" point. He then expounds upon that first point, but never reaches a second point, nor a third or fourth. The explanation merely peters out.--> Kvothe's father sets up a dichotomy between poetry and music that I don't believe exists. (I admit that's only a disagreement rather than a problem with the writing.)--> In several places there was a lack of creativity with turn of phrase. One passage uses the phrase ""there are times"" too many times.--> The author uses the definite article in a number of places were the indefinite article would have been more appropriate. In the passage I marked as an example, Kvothe talks about going ""deeper into the city"" without any prior mention of having entered any city, much less being on the verge of going deeper into it.--> In another place, a beautiful metaphor was ruined when the author spelled out his meaning explicitly. Some metaphors are more powerful if left implied, resting behind the words for the observant reader to find on his own. In this instance, it went from beautiful metaphor to so-so analogy.I also have a much more fundamental, underlying problem with the entire storyline. That is the quality of Kvothe as a character. He's portrayed as a superhuman hero with a towering intellect and dazzling physical prowess. Kvothe can do nothing wrong; no puzzle is too difficult and no problem too big to handle. He can thrive under any circumstance and no lady can resist his advances (neither can beautiful goat-men, for that matter). He wins over the most cynical skeptics and his knowledge of the arts and sciences is without equal. Kvothe advises kings and kills demons. He can even run a clean and comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Kvothe, himself, is his own story's deus ex machina. And that, to me, it is the ultimate expression of unimaginative writing. Supposedly Mr. Rothfuss wrote The Name of the Wind over the course of a decade or more. You'd think, with all that time to contemplate and mull over his book, he could come up with something more interesting than (ironically) ""The Most Interesting Man in the World.""",1.0

It's really really fun and I can feel my brain leaking out of my ears whenever I see Inej and Kaz interact with each other. __________________________Five solid stars. This book pulled me in from the beginning, to the point where I knew I'd found a favorite before I was halfway through. Here, Bardugo integrates a creative plot, interesting and morally grey characters, group dynamics and banter, a great writing style, and some really, really prime romance plots. Goddamn, can Leigh Bardugo write romance. There are very, very few books that I love so wholeheartedly. This series truly is my favorite fantasy series of all time. There's no competition whatsoever. PLOTTING AND WORLDBUILDINGBardugo tosses you right into the main plot from the beginning and keeps you engaged all the way through, even when her focus is on character work. Her plotting is incredibly engaging, with so many twists and turns that the book is hard to put down. This book focuses on mind games and clever plotting. The dregs need to have a thousand backup plans, and everything is brilliantly planned by Bardugo. The Grisha's worldbuilding is very engaging, even though we're thrown in without context; I remember thinking that I would have appreciated a proper map of Ketterdam, and then we GOT a good map in book two! Bardugo's prose is awesome, and there are some truly gorgeous quotes from here. Then again, it doesn't feel as if she's trying too hard or using purple prose. CHARACTER WORK OF PERFECTION
A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.
Bardugo nails character work here. Every single character grows, every single character develops, every single character owns my heart. okay maybe not Matthias quite as much but w/eInej is a member of a gang and a murderer, but she desperately wants to do the right thing and liberate slaves like herself. She's gone through hell and she's come out strong and in control. She feels so real on page; she has a heart but she only lets it out around the people she cares about. I like that combination. Kaz is the most manipulative, terrible, morally black protagonist I've ever read about, and I love him to pieces. He's absolutely an antihero; yes, he's on a mission to save the world, but does he care about saving the world? Nope, he cares about getting his cash. He still manages to be a complex, dimensional character, who genuinely cares about his friends not dying (though he'd never admit it). Jesper is witty and an absolute delight to get a POV chapter from, but he's also incredibly sympathetic as a former farm boy who fell from grace. He likes living on the edge, and he's aware of the pain his own actions have caused him, and he's trying to work through it. Nina is hilarious and idealistic and clever and can go from flirting to making speeches within ten seconds. She's such a great character because she's so earnest and positive despite everything that's happened to her. She's also one of the most badass characters ever.  Wylan doesn't actually have pov chapters here, but he's getting a shoutout from me anyway because of his pov chapters in CK. He's entertaining here, too, coming off as a blushing do-gooder but with rumor and intrigue swirling around his actual past. Matthias is honestly my least favorite. He's dynamic enough and he's got a great character arc, but I don't feel as if he's nearly as original a character as my five. Whatever, I still like him. BANTER AND DOING CHARACTER DYNAMICS RIGHTThe Dregs are such an amazing squad all together. Their banter owns my heart. Jesper and Inej especially have one of my favorite friendship dynamics of all time; their banter and their genuine trust in each other and their lowkey joking about their mutual crush on Kaz. Inej and Nina stand out as well; extra credit for passing the bechdel test with flying colors. Also, the dialogue here absolutely rules. You have no idea how many times I had to hold in laughter. 
“When we get our money, you can burn kruge to keep you warm,” said Kaz. “Let’s go.”Jesper consulted his compass, and they turned south. “I’m going to pay someone to burn my kruge for me.”Kaz fell into step beside him. “Why don’t you pay someone else to pay someone to burn your kruge for you? That’s what the big players do.”“You know what the really big bosses do? They pay someone to pay someone to …”
HOW TO WRITE ROMANCE: A GUIDEBOOK BY LEIGH BARDUGOSeriously, I felt the need to give this an entire section of its own, because the romance here is SO good. But the romance plots never overtake the book; I have an annotations list for these books, and there are twice as many good character moments and gorgeous quotes as there are romantic moments. Kaz and Inej are one of my all-time favorite book couples. I used to consider them my third favorite, but they've quickly become my favorite of all time. They have so many small moments and such slow-build romantic development. And then, as if I weren't invested already, they have that one declaration scene which honestly made me swoon. 
I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.
Jesper and Wylan are just cute for most of the book. They got some cute relationship build, but I wasn't that invested. And then that One Line at the end of the book shows up and they KILLED me. Really, Bardugo? You could've left me heart intact instead, but?? not so much. Also, side note, but I don't understand how anyone was surprised they're a thing in book two. I know heteronormativity is a thing that exists, but how can you read ""not just girls"" and mutual blushing in a heterosexual way? Matthias and Nina were honestly not that big a ship for me here. I absolutely understand what's appealing about their dynamic; they're sweet and have amazing relationship development. But they don't appeal to me personally; I don't have to lie down for twenty minutes when I read their scenes. DIVERSITY: YOUR FAVE COULD NEVERSomething that gets ignored a lot is how diverse this series is; not just in terms of nonwhite characters, lgbt characters, and badass girl characters, although it does have all of those. But Six of Crows also has some of the best rep of a disabled character EVER. It helps that this is ownvoices disability rep. Kaz' disability affects his life in a realistic way, and there's no magical cure for it, BUT he's still a huge badass and the disability never becomes a consuming part of his character!! There's also the fact that a chubby main character is portrayed as the most beautiful member of the group, while also not being reduced to her appearance. There's even a dyslexic character (in FANTASY!) and part of his character arc is learning that his learning difference doesn't make him stupid. There's a major character with ADD as well. This series handles emotional and physical trauma in the best way. Some of these characters have trauma and it's never portrayed as a detriment to who they are as people. It's an aspect of who they are as people, but their background never takes over their characters. It's a balance. Recovery is also portrayed in a great way; none of these characters can be ""fixed"" but that's okay. The entire topic is handled in a better way than most contemporaries that focus entirely on trauma. I appreciate it so much. TL;DR: I was never bored by this book, and I love the characters more than my own life. Highly recommended.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | YoutubeA Bunch of Random Spoilery Notes / CryingUPDATE: I actually got my mother obsessed with my favorite book? in related news I still have to lie down for 40 hours whenever Kaz and Inej interact// three chapters into reading this with my mother and she says ""it's official: I'm in love with Kaz"" and honestly if that isn't the mood for today• remember when we all thought Wylan had gotten kicked out for banging his tutor? is it even canonically confirmed that he didn't? i need answers• I BRed a second reread of this (yes, I've read it three times, shut up) with Amy, whose review you should definitely check out!!• every single moment of banter is my favorite but my underrated fave is probably ""If I see a single scratch or nick on those, I'll spell 'forgive me' on your chest in bullet holes"" and the ensuing debate over whether 'I'm sorry' would be better• ""Close your eyes!"" ""You can't kiss me from down there, Wylan.""• or maybe it's ""my ghost won't associate with your ghost"" • every time Kaz and Inej interact I have to lie down for 40 hours• Jesper and Wylan are probably angstier in this book than book 2?• I don't even understand how it's possible not to love this book. With most of my faves, I love them, but I get it if you don't love them. I flat-out don't understand how anyone could not love this book. It's a masterpiece.",5.0

145,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
146,The Last Murder at the End of the World,Mystery,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.",Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...,2.0

148,The Mystery Writer,Mystery,"A literary thriller about an aspiring writer who meets and falls in love with her literary idol—only to find him murdered the day after she gave him her manuscript to read. There's nothing easier to dismiss than a conspiracy theory—until it turns out to be trueWhen Theodosia Benton abandons her career path as an attorney and shows up on her brother's doorstep with two suitcases and an unfinished novel, she expects to face a few challenges. Will her brother support her ambition or send her back to finish her degree? What will her parents say when they learn of her decision? Does she even have what it takes to be a successful writer?What Theo never expects is to be drawn into a hidden literary world in which identity is something that can be lost and remade for the sake of an audience. When her mentor, a highly successful author, is brutally murdered, Theo wants the killer to be found and justice to be served. Then the police begin looking at her brother, Gus, as their prime suspect, and Theo does the unthinkable in order to protect him. But the writer has left a trail, a thread out of the labyrinth in the form of a story. Gus finds that thread and follows it, and in his attempt to save his sister he inadvertently threatens the foundations of the labyrinth itself. To protect the carefully constructed narrative, Theo Benton, and everyone looking for her, will have to die.","I have a habit of automatically requesting books from authors that I have enjoyed before-often without even reading the premise! Next year, I will have to be more discerning, and start reading the synopsis to determine if the particular story is REALLY a fit for me, despite past positive experiences with the author!Had I done so in this case, (and the synopsis really shares too much!) I wouldn’t have requested this book, as I know that I rarely enjoy a story about conspiracy theories or the people who believe in them. But, that wasn’t the only issue I had with this book…**Theo Benton has left the University she has been attending, convinced that her career path as an attorney is the wrong path for her, and shown up on her brother's doorstep in Kansas with two suitcases and an unfinished novel.She decides to finish her book at cafe/bar called “Benders”, which happens to already have a highly successful “writer in residence”, Dan Murdoch, who quickly becomes her mentor-until he is brutally murdered.Could his senseless death have anything to do with the Conspiracy Theories he has been researching?Was he involved or is there another agenda at work? Theo is determined to find out.Unfortunately, despite her good intentions, I could not connect with Theo, who comes across as a weepy, naive “damsel in distress” who needs continual rescuing from her brother Gus, and his friend and associate, Mac, whose family are “Doomsday Preppers”.Another issue-as written, you would believe that all Americans run around armed with a gun.In addition, despite 400 pages, the last 30% uses SEVERAL abrupt time jumps, to move the story to its denouement, making the ending feel extremely rushed. (and over the top)“After She Wrote Him” earned 4 stars from me, and “The Woman in the Library” earned 5 stars and a place on my FAVORITE READS shelf for 2022, so I am sure this is a one off and I am still looking forward to seeing what Sulari Gentill pens next. But this isn’t one that I can recommend. 2 stars ⭐️Available Now to those who feel they might be the right audience for this book.Thank You to the Poisoned Pen Press for the gifted ARC provided through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",2.0
149,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

150,Off the Air,Mystery,"Equal parts thought-provoking and entertaining, Emmy Award winning reporter Christina Estes introduces Jolene Garcia in her Tony Hillerman Prize winning debut, Off the Air .Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, splitting her time between covering general assignments―anything from a monsoon storm to a newborn giraffe at the zoo―and special projects. Stories that take more time to research and produce. Stories that Jolene wants to tell.When word gets out about a death at a radio station, Jolene and other journalists swarm the scene, intent on reporting the facts first. The body is soon identified as Larry Lemmon, a controversial talk show host, who died under suspicious circumstances. Jolene conducted his final interview, giving her and her station an advantage. But not for long.As the story heats up, so does the competition. Jolene is determined to solve this murder. It’s an investigation that could make or break her career―if it doesn't break her first.","Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, who splits her time between covering general interest assignments and working on special projects.

(Mostly the last two, but I guess that is what reporters see more of)It is also so loaded with facts about how reporting has changed over the years from just reporting a story and competing for ratings, to competing for clicks on Social Media, and racing to be the first to “tweet” a breaking story.So much so, that the story often reads more like an expose on the “cut throat day in the life of a journalist”- than as fiction-and the over abundance of facts took me out of the story, and slowed down the pace. Maybe those interested in this career might enjoy this more?Also, a negative for me-that POLITICS played a big role in the narrative.One thing I can say- when I found out what Lemmon did to get himself killed-I agreed with the PERP who declared that Lemmon got what was coming to him. 😉TRIGGER WARNINGS thoughtfully provided by the author in alphabetical order: References to abandonment, ageism, animal cruelty, child neglect, classism, homelessness, racism, sexism, sexual coercion, and substance abuse.A buddy read with DeAnn.

151,A Grave Robbery,Mystery,"Lord Rosemorran has purchased a wax figure of a beautiful reclining woman and asks Stoker to incorporate a clockwork mechanism to give the Rosemorran Collection its own Sleeping Beauty in the style of Madame Tussaud’s. But when Stoker goes to cut the mannequin open to insert the mechanism, he makes a gruesome discovery: this is no wax figure. The mannequin is the beautifully preserved body of a young woman who was once very much alive. But who would do such a dreadful thing, and why? Sleuthing out the answer to this question sets Veronica and Stoker on their wildest adventure yet. From the underground laboratories of scientists experimenting with electricity to resurrect the dead in the vein of Frankenstein to the traveling show where Stoker once toured as an attraction, the gaslit atmosphere of London in October is the perfect setting for this investigation into the unknown. Through it all, the intrepid pair is always one step behind the latest villain—a man who has killed once and will stop at nothing to recover the body of the woman he loved. Will they unmask him in time to save his next victim? Or will they become the latest figures to be immortalized in his collection of horrors?","It's no secret that I ADORE the Veronica Speedwell series. When @prhaudio #prhaudiopartner granted me freeaccess to the audiobook of 𝐀 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐁𝐁𝐄𝐑𝐘 (PUB 03.12) early I threw all other plans aside and pressed play.I LOVE this series and this is a new favorite! I think that audio is the BEST way to experience this engaging historical mystery adventure of Speedwell and Stoker. This installment is dedicated to the audiobook narrator, Angele Masters, and her voice is masterful perfection. She has become the voice of Veronica and it's magic to my ears.(Yes- you must read them in order.)I was smiling and laughing within the first 2 minutes. I loved this installment so so much. As with any great series, I find great comfort in returning to these well-known, well-loved characters. I love seeing the character's relationship evolve. After 8 books, I was surprised to find myself swooning over Speedwell and Stoker in a fresh, new way. Tender and tenacious. Veronica Speedwell is my favorite kind of character: smart, quick-tongued, vivacious, and loyal. She knows who she is and won't sacrifice that based on anyone's expectations. She is full of moxie and gumption. I wish I could join her for a glass of aguardiente as she regales me with tales of her and Stoker's latest mystery.(P.S.- Stoker's not bad either) #speedwellandstoker4lifeDeanna Raybourn has this magical ability to bring the mystery to life through both her writing and storytelling style.

152,The Extinction of Irena Rey,Fiction,"Eight translators arrive at a house in a forest on the border of Belarus. It belongs to the world-renowned author Irena Rey, and they are there to translate her magnum opus, Gray Eminence. But within days of their arrival, Irena disappears without a trace.The translators, who hail from eight different countries but share the same reverence for their beloved author, begin to investigate where she may have gone while proceeding with work on her masterpiece. They explore this ancient wooded refuge with its intoxicating slime molds and lichens, and study her exotic belongings and layered texts for clues. But doing so reveals secrets — and deceptions — of Irena Rey's that they are utterly unprepared for. Forced to face their differences as they grow increasingly paranoid in this fever dream of isolation and obsession, soon the translators are tangled up in a web of rivalries and desire, threatening not only their work but the fate of their beloved author herself.This hilarious, thought-provoking second outing by award-winning translator and author Jennifer Croft is a brilliant examination of art, celebrity, the natural world, and the power of language. It is an unforgettable, unputdownable adventure with a small but global cast of characters shaken by the shocks of love, destruction, and creation in one of Europe’s last great wildernesses.","Jennifer Croft’s droll, brainteaser of a novel slowly shifts into the realms of the absurd. Like characters from Agatha Christie, eight translators are summoned to an isolated house on the edge of an ancient, Polish forest. Once there, their host, world-famous author Irena Rey, inexplicably vanishes, leaving her eight translators to work out what’s happened – and if it might happen to them too. The book we’re presented with is an account of their experiences and attempts to find Rey. It’s written by one of the eight - at first known only by her translation language Spanish, later as Emi. However, there’s a complication, the version of Emi’s autofictional piece on offer here is actually a translation from Polish to English. A translation carried out by English aka Alexis, another of the eight, and a character in Emi’s book. Alexis’s introduction makes it clear she considers Emi’s version of events highly suspect, casting doubt on her reliability as a narrator. But Alexis’s framing is also somewhat self-serving - since she’s obviously unhappy about her portrayal here - so could it actually be Alexis who’s unreliable? It’s a conundrum we’re left to ponder. Emi recounts the eight’s arrival at Rey’s house, she’s distraught that the once-luminous Irena now seems close to abject, apparently abandoned by her husband, and oddly tight-lipped about her new book Grey Eminence previously billed as her magnum opus. There’s a pervasive sense of foreboding, intensified by an ill-fated, expedition to nearby Białowieża Forest, a brooding, primeval place with a sinister history. The house too has a gothic feel despite its Japanese, organic design, filled with strange artefacts, it’s a veritable cabinet of curiosities. In Alexis’s translation, Emi’s style seems unintentionally amusing, mannered and bordering on archaic at times. But is this an accurate reflection of Emi’s writing or a parody that furthers Alexis’s agenda? Or could it be that Alexis just isn’t a very competent translator? Alexis muddies the waters even further by interweaving Emi’s text with detailed footnotes that veer between clarification, exasperation and outright intervention. It’s a move worthy of Borges, whose influence is detectable throughout Jennifer Croft’s novel. Borges alongside half-buried allusions to writers like Poe and Henry James, the interplay between Emi and Alexis, Emi’s excessive reverence for Rey as author of near-sacred work versus Alexis’s more pragmatic stance, all point to Croft’s underlying concerns. Croft’s intent on exploring and contesting popular notions of authorship and meaning, relations between author and translator. Croft is known for her award-winning translations, and her novel bears distinct traces of the Polish literature she’s most famous for - particularly Olga Tokarczuk’s fiction, there’s more than a hint of Gombrowicz here too. Croft challenges traditional binaries, divides between author and translator and also, through Białowieża Forest, nature and culture. Białowieża is a unique place that Croft’s visited more than once, it sustains a rich diversity of flora, fauna and wildlife, some no longer exist anywhere but there. Croft deliberately sets her story in 2017, a time when the Forest came under threat from extensive logging projects as a result of changes in government policy. Croft uses the Forest and Rey’s character to introduce wider questions around ecology, climate change and art in a time of extinction. Rey’s new book revolves around many of these issues including whether or not art is an essentially destructive force. They’re intriguing questions although not ones that Croft always fully, or entirely convincingly, addresses. Croft unites her interest in ecology and authorship by drawing on ideas circulating in literary, queer and feminist theory. She inserts a series of puzzling references and reflections on the fungi and lichen found throughout the forest - often regarded as discrete organisms, now understood as part of a collective, an inter-sustaining network of living things. Croft has dubbed translation a kind of ‘superlichen’ a process of interconnection and collaboration, embedded in a wider literary and cultural ecosystem. An understanding of translation which deeply troubles established notions of the author as celebrity or individual with a unique, authorial voice – an idea of authorship modelled by Emi in Croft’s narrative through Emi’s hyperbolic regard for Rey and her work. Croft’s novel of ideas is often entertaining and thought-provoking, but it can also be essayistic, dense and overpacked: Croft can't resist including commentaries on topics ranging from publishing culture to rising racism and xenophobia in Europe. I had mixed reactions to this one, it’s well-crafted and I admired its ambition. But it also felt a bit stretched out, overly long, and quite laboured at times – there are a number of points where the plot is too transparently operating as a vehicle for Croft’s ideas.

153,The Summer She Went Missing,Mystery,"Last summer, they searched for Audrey Covington. This summer, they'll search for the truth. Paige Redmond has always felt lucky to spend her summers in Clearwater Ridge, with lazy days sunning at the waterfalls and nights partying at the sprawling houses of the rich families who vacation there. The Covingtons are one of these families, and beautiful, brilliant Audrey Covington is Paige's best friend. And last year, when Audrey's crush-worthy brother Dylan finally started noticing Paige, she was sure it would be the best summer ever. Except Audrey didn't seem quite like herself. Then one night, she didn't come home. Though Audrey wasn't the first girl to disappear in Clearwater Ridge, she left behind more lies than clues. Now, one summer later, her case has gone cold, and nobody, least of all Paige, can make sense of what happened. When Paige stumbles across a secret hidden in Audrey's room, however, it changes everything she thought she knew about last summer. She and Dylan set out on their own investigation, discovering things even the police don't know about the people of Clearwater Ridge. But tracking down missing girls―girls who might be beyond saving by now―means entering a world far darker than Paige has ever imagined. And if she isn't careful, she'll become the next girl to vanish.","REVIEW TO COME FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME😭, I'm so behind on reviews at this point😂.",4.0
154,The Other Lola,Young Adult,"No more mysteries, no more podcasts, and no more sticking their heads where they don’t belong.Until Mattie Brosillard, a freshman at their high school, shows up on their doorstep, begging Cam and Blair for help. Mattie's sister Lola disappeared mysteriously five years ago. No trace of her was ever found. Now, she's back--but Mattie is convinced the girl who returned is an impostor. Nobody believes Mattie's wild story--not Mattie's brother, not Mattie's mother, and not even Cam and Blair. But something is definitely wrong in the Brosillard family. And Blair has her own reasons for wanting to know what really happened to Lola while she was gone.With Cam and Blair still struggling with the aftermath of their first mystery―and with new secrets swirling between them―the stakes are higher than ever in this can’t-miss sequel to Missing Clarissa.","The Other Lola is a follow-up to the 2023-release, Missing Clarissa. These are YA-Mystery stories following two main characters: Blair and Cam.In Missing Clarissa, Cam and Blair investigate the disappearance of popular cheerleader, Clarissa Campbell, who went missing from their small town of Oreville, Washington, 20-years before.It starts as a project for their high school Journalism class and ends up being a viral podcast, as well as a life-endangering pursuit of amateur sleuthing.At the end of the Clarissa case, Cam and Blair had sudden fame, but with it, a lot of unwanted attention. They vowed to never do it again; to stick their noses in where they don't belong, to make a podcast, none of it.Then they meet Mattie, a Freshman at their high school. Mattie shows up on the literal doorstep, begging for the girls' help with an unsettling family situation.Mattie's sister, Lola, disappeared mysteriously five years ago. The thing is, Lola has returned. She's not talking about where she has been all these years, and Mattie is convinced she's an imposter, but no one else believes Mattie; not her mother, not her brother, Luke, no one.Blair and Cam, Blair in particular, are moved by Mattie's story. They seem so passionate about it. It couldn't hurt to help them out, could it? Look into it a little...Before they know it, the two are neck deep in another dangerous investigation, but with secrets between them, how will they ever be able to get to the bottom of someone else's twisted family drama? I was intrigued by this initially, and did enjoy following Cam and Blair during the investigation. For me, it wasn't quite as compelling as the first book, but yeah, still a solid story.The audiobook has great narration and I would recommend that format. I was able to fly through this story and I did find that the narrator helped to keep me engaged, even when I was rolling my eyes a little bit.I felt like, and I could be misremembering, but for me, personal issues for Blair and Cam took much more of a front seat in this one than the first book. In a way, this almost felt like a straight YA Contemporary story, with a slight mystery happening in the background.By this I mean, the mystery almost took a back seat to Cam and Blair's interpersonal dramas. With this being said though, I do really enjoy both Cam and Blair as characters and I love their friendship. So, it's not like I was disappointed with those aspects of the story, it just seemed more difficult to get as invested in the mystery surrounding Lola because of it.Additionally, there were things at the end that I found unsatisfying; that just didn't make sense. I am mainly referring to the events following the big reveal, so sadly, I can't comment more without giving the ending away.Overall though, I still enjoyed Cam and Blair, their friendship and the idea of two smart high school girls taking on the world and solving mysteries. That's a fun concept, which is fairly well executed within these stories.There are hints that there could be more with these characters in the future. I would be interested in picking up future books, if that turns out to be the case.Thank you to the publisher, Wednesday Books and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copy to read and review.

That’s why when one of her students got arrested for murder Kate wasn’t afraid to go all out to prove his innocence even if he was a trouble maker in the class room.This Author never disappoints This Reader. Amanda Flower is my favorite Cozy mystery Author. The book was well researched and I thought it was a delightful introduction of a new series. I always enjoy going back in history to my grandparents early years and enjoy reading about the lifestyle of that era. I thought Kate’s character was cute and mischievous. She had a knack of getting herself into trouble as you will find out when you read this book. I recommend this book to readers of cozy mystery, historical fiction and women’s fiction. This book is a clean read. To Slip the Bonds of Earth is scheduled to be released on 3/26/24.I voluntarily read an advanced readers copy of this book.

Adopted as a baby, she learned about him while looking into her late birth mother, and is curious to know more about this lost sibling.

Retired police officer Larry Palmer is a widower with nothing but time and in need of a purpose. He offers to help Amanda find answers. The search leads to shocking and heartbreaking discoveries.

Tru has always lived in that shadow. Sometimes, it seems like she knows the long-dead Bailey, feels the dead girl in her bones. Now she's supposed to head to FSU in the fall with her boyfriend, but those unsolved murders - and the death of her own sister - invade her every thought. It’s only in the shadowy deep, 100 feet below the surface of Hidden Glen Springs, that she can breathe. When a strange girl named Rio rolls into town, hell-bent on figuring out who killed Bailey and Celeste, Tru can't resist entangling herself in the thrill of solving the decades old mystery any more than she can resist her familiar, aching attraction to Rio.As the summer heat ignites, so does the spark between Tru and Rio...along with their other-worldy connection to Bailey and Celeste. But when someone begins stalking them, the girls become convinced the killer is back in town. And if they keep digging into the past, Tru and Rio know this time, it could be their blood that makes the springs run red.","**Many thanks to BookishFirst, Penguin Teen, and Ginny Myers Sain for an ARC of this book!**
Don't fear the reaper...
Tru doesn't know what that message means when she finds it...but with the unsolved mysteries and murders in Mount Orange's past, she KNOWS it can't be good. Aside from losing her sister tragically years ago, Tru has also been saddened and fascinated by the unsolved murders of two teen girls, Bailey and Celeste, and would LOVE to use the resources at her newspaper job to dig down deep into the cold cases...because there's something inside her that tells her that SHE is meant to find the truth...but 
why?
Tru is also hiding a secret from her longtime boyfriend and family...not only does she not plan to go to college with him at FSU in the fall...she's not even sure if this 'perfect' relationship feels right to her anymore. Her one solace is diving, and Tru spends a LOT of her time exploring the deep and looking for answers at the bottom of the water. Enter Rio, a fascinating, beautiful, and mysterious fellow diver, who appears seemingly out of nowhere...and forms an INSTANT bond with Tru.As the two become fast friends, their feelings start to spill into uncharted territory...and Rio reveals that she too feels a pull towards the Bailey and Celeste murders. The girls almost feel as though they were CALLED to this dark exploration...and when they start to reveal facts that only Bailey and Celeste could have known, and an indescribable feeling that they've known each other for many years in a very intimate way...the pieces seem to slowly be coming together. But when they find the aforementioned ""Don't fear the reaper"" note tacked to their tent one night, and hear terrifying sounds in the woods that same evening...it seems like the girls have stumbled upon dangerous information...information SOMEONE would kill to keep hidden. Can Tru and Rio uncover the secret of Bailey and Celeste's demise...
before they get PERMANENTLY swallowed by the deep?
There is something so theatrical and yet accessible about Ginny Myers Sain's books, and with this one as my third read of hers, I've come to expect certain qualities when 'diving' into her stories. 😉 There will be murder, intrigue, the tortured push and pull of teenage friendships (and love stories!), and an atmosphere that ALWAYS leaps off the page...and thrusts me headlong into somewhere completely unexpected...and of COURSE, also very creepy! This time, we land in sunny Florida, and there is certainly enough detail here to bring to mind the almost oppressive humidity found only in the Sunshine State. In this one, Tru and Rio (no coincidence that this is her name, I'm sure! 🌊) also spend a great deal of time on dives and underwater, and these passages also brought the dark and terrifying nature of the Deep to life...and had me holding MY breath each time they went down!Although I enjoyed these two main characters enough, I have to say in this one...I almost felt like TOO many of the 'townsfolk' had been invited to the party. Lots of the characters also have very odd or uncommon names (Derry, for example...and don't get me started on John Boy! 😣) I know we needed a SOMEWHAT larger cast to provide 'suspects' and give some depth to the plot itself, but unlike some of Myers Sain's previous books, this time I felt VERY much like I was reading teenagers...who were acting a LOT like teenagers. Of course, this is fine: this book IS YA, after all. But with so much emphasis on smoking, uh, 'alternative substances', and of course the burgeoning romances (or eroding romances) between several of the characters, it felt like there was almost too much going on at times...and yet, not the sort of events and feelings I WANTED to learn more about as we went along.And then there's of course the paranormal element that is always present in Myers Sain's books, and it WAS present here...but in a muted, downplayed way. Part of this was I think intended to keep the reader guessing (and it absolutely worked!) but I have to admit after lots of buildup and the ENTIRELY unfair and tragic death of one character that I truly liked 😢 the denouement felt like a bit of a letdown and steered sharply away from the groundwork that Myers Sain had laid and the trail of breadcrumbs I had been following...and it's hard to say that I wasn't slightly disappointed. There is also a pretty heavy emphasis on the relationship (?) or not between Rio and Tru, so if you aren't into a bit of romance in your thrillers, I would steer clear.And as to whether Tru can 'tru-ly' trust Rio?It'll be up to YOU to revisit these lyrics after reading and see if they turn out to be true!Love of two is oneHere but now they're goneCame the last night of sadnessAnd it was clear she couldn't go on😳😉4 stars, rounded up from 3.5",4.0
160,The Housemaid's Secret,Thriller,"As he continues showing me their incredible penthouse apartment, I have a terrible feeling about the woman behind closed doors. But I can't risk losing this job – not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It's hard to find an employer who doesn't ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything...That's when I make a promise. After all, I've done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

161,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars! OVERALL: SURPRISINGLY ENJOYABLE!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0
162,"Good Girl, Bad Blood",Mystery,"Pip is not a detective anymore.With the help of Ravi Singh, she released a true-crime podcast about the murder case they solved together last year. The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

 🤨Mmmmmm yeah, no. This was not good. I did not enjoy it at all, and I recommend it to nobody. Okay that’s the review, bye!!!!!Lol yeah, maybe one day I’ll be the person who can just rate and move on but today is not that day! And I am not that guy.As of now, I can see I am in the minority opinion. It wasn’t far into The Maid before I realized this wasn’t going to be a positive experience for me. But I’d like to give a shout out to Jan B’s review for bringing up a lot of things I was thinking while reading, and to Chelsea who lets me complain to her uninhibited. As a BOTM pick, a book slated for adaptation and an author who is a publishing executive, this one’s gonna have a lot of eyes on it, and I want to make sure there are perspectives present beyond the flurry of glowing reviews.The premise of The Maid is such: a hotel maid who is “different” from other people discovers the dead body of one of the hotel’s wealthiest patrons, foul play suspected. She gets further dragged into the fray and unintentionally incriminates herself, all while misreading what should be “obvious” social cues. There’s murder, money, drugs, off-page violence and ~mystery~ all wrapped in something meant to be somewhere between a cozy mystery and a genre thriller. The plot itself is fine, though nothing we haven’t seen before. Instead, what’s carrying the story is the titular Molly the Maid, set up as a lovable underdog that just gets in over her head. She works hard! She is a good person! She tries her best! And she LOOOOOVES to clean!!!!!!! Clearly this is meant to be cute and charming.But Molly is also written as neurodivergent in some never-specified way. I’ve seen a couple of weird arguments by people saying the author has not confirmed this, but she doesn’t have to. I read it; the writing is not exactly subtle. And I did not love the way she was depicted at all, to be totally honest. I can only guess that Nita Prose was trying to capitalize on that ‘quirky female main character who whoopsie-daisies her way into some trouble’ trend from like 5ish years ago. And frankly, she missed the boat. This isn’t a fresh, compelling character idea—and in the case of The Maid, it wasn’t even well done.Listen, I understand the intent behind a character like this. I’m not saying it’s necessarily offensive, but it sure as hell isn’t cute. And the idea of a gaggle of privileged, upper-middle class book club women reading and gigging at a character like Molly being framed for murder because she ‘doesn’t understand how people work’ makes me feel kind of weird. Molly appears as a caricature, dreamed up by someone who’s only exposure to ND people has been Rain Man and Eleanor Oliphant. As others have noted, Molly’s qualities aren’t very consistent. They wax and wane depending on the need of the story. She doesn’t understand what a rumba is or can’t tell if someone is smiling or not, but then is effectively spouting off complex behavioral analysis a few chapters later. The situations she finds herself in are beyond ludicrous, and the way she inevitably gets out of them even more ridiculous. And Molly isn’t the exception to bad characterizations. Every single other person, from the villain(s), to the fumbling police, to the rest of the hotel staff—are all cartoonishly portrayed. There’s probably more subtext I’m missing, with the two additional POC maids and the undocumented kitchen employee (I’m sorry, where is this supposed to take place again? The UK?? Is there a large number of undocumented Mexican immigrants working at British hotels that I’m unaware of???). Because this book isn’t about the challenges of operating in a neurotypical world or the difficulties of navigating a new country while undocumented, but instead those are just secondary stumbling blocks on the road to figure out who murdered this rich white guy. And I don’t feel as though Molly and Juan Manuel were treated with care, but instead a kind of passive cruelty.That said, the biggest offense for me though? This was boring as hell. I couldn’t read more than a dozen or so pages at a time, despite how short it was. I have genuinely no idea how or who chooses which mystery/thrillers to acquire, let alone adapt, but they need to have the company checkbook taken away immediately. Anything present in the story that was out of the ordinary was equal parts absurd and dumb, and anything remotely passable has been done a thousand times already. Seriously someone, anyone, clue me in to what was so compelling about this meditation on why ‘ummm service workers actually LOVE cleaning and waiting on our every whim?!’ with a side helping of murder. I’m literally begging you. I’ll refrain from ending spoilers even though I don’t think it’s worth reading, but that big ‘twist’ was so obvious while also being completely unnecessary. It cheapened every bit of plot up to that point, though by then it was mostly a lost cause for me. one additional note: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ASSISTED SUICIDE ““TWIST””?!? EXCUSE ME.Anyways, someone please call Florence Pugh’s agent and have her pull out of this ASAP. I’m having war flashbacks of Maddie Ziegler and Kate Hudson in Sia’s MUSIC. 😐*Thanks to Random House - Ballantine for the advance review copy!**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!",2.0
164,A Flicker in the Dark,Thriller,"When Chloe Davis was twelve, six teenage girls went missing in her small Louisiana town. By the end of the summer, Chloe’s father had been arrested as a serial killer and promptly put in prison. Chloe and the rest of her family were left to grapple with the truth and try to move forward while dealing with the aftermath.Now 20 years later, Chloe is a psychologist in private practice in Baton Rouge and getting ready for her wedding. She finally has a fragile grasp on the happiness she’s worked so hard to get. Sometimes, though, she feels as out of control of her own life as the troubled teens who are her patients. And then a local teenage girl goes missing, and then another, and that terrifying summer comes crashing back. Is she paranoid, and seeing parallels that aren't really there, or for the second time in her life, is she about to unmask a killer?In a debut novel that has already been optioned for a limited series by actress Emma Stone and sold to a dozen countries around the world, Stacy Willingham has created an unforgettable character in a spellbinding thriller that will appeal equally to fans of Gillian Flynn and Karin Slaughter.","I almost always give even the shittiest books at least two stars because the author I'm bashing wrote words and got them published. Good job. However, given that the story has already been optioned by Emma Stone, I don't think the author will be weeping into her labradoodle's fur over my piddly little review. So, fuck it. ONE STAR.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD""Psychology,"" I said. ""I'm hoping to pursue my PhD here next fall - then, eventually get my master's."" Reader, my eyes closed in pain. I'd like to call this an editorial error, but I think the main character is actually this stupid. I have a master's degree. I also have a doctorate. Which one do you think came first - the doctor designation, or the dusty, useless piece of paper my mom put in a frame? Hmm.Where to even start with this book? Chloe Davis, the human equivalent of hold music, is very deeply damaged. She's the daughter of a notorious serial killer, and she's done everything she can to separate herself from that life. Those efforts include the following: not changing her name, moving an hour away from her hometown, giving an interview on how her serial killer father inspired her career, ETC. Girlfriend, have you heard of Google? Everybody knows you. Your Ken-doll fiancé - yeah, you didn't have to reveal nothing, because other people know how the internet works.Yep, let's discuss Ken-doll: he throws you surprise parties even though he knows you freak out about everything. He unilaterally decides to throw in a little surprise choking during some nice, relaxing morning sex. (Didn't your father's victims die by choking? Huh. Tacky). Dude disappears all the time and you never really bother to ask where he is or what he's doing. Sounds super great. A nice healthy relationship. At least you can call in prescriptions in his name! (Apparently psychologists can do that in Louisiana --solidifying the decision to set the book here, because this girl would have never made it through medical school).Elevator music drug and alcohol problem: Look, I realize I'm more Hunter S. Thompson than most, but this D & A problem ain't really that bad. I work with lawyers and criminal defendants, and ALL of us are taking benzos legally or illegally and in much higher quantities than Princess Chloe here. You're worried ONE xanax is going to muck up your day? If you're really an addict, you'd have to take half the bottle to even notice you took anything. Two glasses of wine after a xanax, and you wake up not remembering what happened? Two xanax and you lose a DAY AND A HALF? This is some amateur shit right here. Our girl talks about having done all of this since college (10-12 years?) -- this is your tolerance? LEAVE THIS PARTY RIGHT NOW. Some other random thoughts: they find Valium in the first victim's hair follicles approximately two seconds after they find the body. What coroner on what earth is looking at a hair follicle test first thing? Those things take days to process in a best case scenario. They would use a blood test, a vitreous fluid test, maybe even a urine test if there was any remaining. I've sat through enough expert witness testimony to feel personally affronted by this scene. This inattention to detail covered the entire book. I understand we don't all need to know the science. But if you don't have the science, you need the characters. Ergo, if there is neither science nor character, you have a fucking snoozer, my friends. Who even needs the Xanax at this point. SHE SLEEPS WITH THE FAKE REPORTER MURDERER. God! Was the choking the day before not enough? Also, there was chocolate on a pillow at a Motel 6? Laugh out loud. This is like Blair from ""Gossip Girl"" trying to write ""poor.""Then, revelation time. Chloe has solved this puzzle! The dang murderer is obviously taking these girls to Chloe's childhood home. She also apparently used to know him, because he's from her home town. EYE ROLL. She is going to drive right to the house and not tell anyone about it. She is also going to leave her phone in the car because why would you need that? (Aside: a famous serial killer's house has been sitting empty for 20 years and it's somehow completely intact, not vandalized, burned down...?) In what world?Well, thankfully Dr. Brilliant Chloe remembers to take the gun into the house, even though she's never shot a gun in her life. Earlier in the book, she even rues the fact. ""Golly gee, I should really learn to shoot this thing."" But, in this perfect moment, the benzos have steadied her hands, and she shoots that dumb fucker reporter lover murderer right in the fatal spot. Deus ex 9mm.But, of course that's not the end, because the killer from 20 years ago was Chloe's weirdo brother. Did that surprise a single person who read this? The serial killer sitting in jail never actually did it, duh. Turns out those porno mags Cooper kept in his room really pushed him over the edge. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE. Cooper feels the darkness, he says. Yeah, dude. We all feel the fucking darkness. Take this bottle of xanax and work it out.The ending is Chloe arriving at her former(?) fiancé's sister's house. She drove to Mississippi to return the ring (certified mail anyone?), but she doesn't actually want to talk to Ken-doll. In retrospect, and aside from not asking permission for the choking, he wasn't so bad. He's a pharmaceutical rep and she's a drug ""addict."" Match made in heaven, DUH.Chloe's dad gets out of jail because, also, DUH. My only emotional response to that was that everyone should watch the show Rectify and forget they read this stupid fucking book. If my kid was murdering people, you better believe I wouldn't take a murder rap for that little psycho!

165,Cut and Thirst,Short Stories,"Myrna, Leonie, and Chrissy meet every Thursday to sample fine cheeses, to reminisce about their former lives as professors, and lately, to muse about murder. Decades ago, a vicious cabal of male poets contrived—quite publicly and successfully—to undermine the writing career, confidence, and health of their dear friend Fern. Now, after Fern has taken a turn for the worse, her three old friends decide that it’s finally time to strike back—in secret, of course, since Fern is far too gentle to approve of a vendetta. All they need is a plan with suitably Shakespearean drama. But as sweet and satisfying as revenge can be, it’s not always so cut and dried.","I thoroughly enjoyed this short story featuring three retired professors who meet weekly to reminisce about their lives and careers over cheese and their beverage of choice. Their discussions turn to the topic of one of their common friends, Fern, a writer who was targeted in a coordinated effort instigated by a fellow writer to ruin her literary career years ago. The friends believe that this incident created a situation that exacerbated her declining health. We follow them as they go about devising a plan to avenge their friend (who is unaware of their intentions). As they weigh their options with meticulous precision, it soon becomes evident that framing and executing a foolproof plan might prove to be a tad more complicated than they had anticipated.Touching upon themes of aging, friendship, loyalty, revenge and professional jealousy Cut and Thirst by Margaret Atwood, is a quick entertaining read. I loved the banter between the friends (strong Golden Girls vibes!). With sharp dialogue, more than a few laugh-out-loud moments and interesting characters, this short story is perfect if you’re looking for a palate cleanser or just a good laugh in between more serious reading. Don’t overthink this one and just enjoy the ride!This short story was my Amazon First Reads choice for April 2024.Connect with me! ✏ Instagram ✏ My Blog ✏ The StoryGraph",4.0
166,All Good People Here,Mystery,"Margot Davies was six at the time, the same age as January—and they were next-door neighbors. In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist, but she’s always been haunted by the fear that it could’ve been her. And the worst part is, January’s killer has never been brought to justice.When Margot returns home to help care for her sick uncle, it feels like walking into a time capsule. Wakarusa is exactly how she remembered: genial, stifled, secretive. Then news breaks about five-year-old Natalie Clark from the next town over, who’s gone missing under eerily similar circumstances. With all the old feelings rushing back, Margot vows to find Natalie and solve January’s murder once and for all.But the police, the family, the townspeople—they all seem to be hiding something. And the deeper Margot digs into Natalie’s disappearance, the more resistance she encounters, and the colder January’s case feels. Could the killer still be out there? Could it be the same person who kidnapped Natalie? And what will it cost to finally discover what truly happened that night?In the propulsive debut novel from the host of the #1 true crime podcast ""Crime Junkie,"" a journalist uncovers her hometown’s dark secrets when she becomes obsessed with the unsolved murder of her childhood neighbor—and the disappearance of another girl twenty years later.","Hmm…semi-satisfying -I was so close to love this book but that abrupt ending gave me second thoughts- review is coming up!True crime and podcast elements, tight knitted- conservative- nosy small town theme and two girls’ brutal murder investigations collide the past tragedies into present kind of intriguing plot line: were the strengths of this story!  Margot Davies who returns her hometown Wakarusa after 20 years where the brutal murder of her neighbor girl and her childhood best friend January Jacobs has scandalized the entire community and haunted the reputation of Jacobs family whose members keeping secrets that torn them apart. Margot is journalist and she returns to take care of her fifty years old uncle Luke who was the only father figure for her when her father failed at this job.

Townies of Wakarusa already start criticizing the situation and another vandalizing attack happens at Jacobs’ front walls just like twenty years ago when their daughter has been kidnapped and killed.  Even though she’s sacked from her job at the newspaper because of emergency situation her uncle created has prevented her to write a good article about the murder investigation, she is adamant to dig out more to bring out the skeletons townies his in their closets which mean she also has to dig out her own past, learning secrets about her own family. The book’s progress is extra slow burn after the strong opening. The chapters were a little dragging. Because of the interesting topic I kept on reading and I was about to round up 3.5 stars to 4 but that abrupt, weird ending which force us fill the blanks to write our own ending was semi satisfying for me! Unfortunately I cut the half star and I decided to give three solid, it’s not very good but it’s still okay read stars!  I’m still interested in reading more future works of the author. It was still a promising start!

167,The Paris Apartment,Mystery,"She’s broke and alone, and she’s just left her job under less than ideal circumstances. Her half-brother Ben didn’t sound thrilled when she asked if she could crash with him for a bit, but he didn’t say no, and surely everything will look better from Paris. Only when she shows up – to find a very nice apartment, could Ben really have afforded this? – he’s not there.The longer Ben stays missing, the more Jess starts to dig into her brother’s situation, and the more questions she has. Ben’s neighbors are an eclectic bunch, and not particularly friendly. Jess may have come to Paris to escape her past, but it’s starting to look like it’s Ben’s future that’s in question.The socialite – The nice guy – The alcoholic – The girl on the verge – The conciergeEveryone’s a neighbor. Everyone’s a suspect. And everyone knows something they’re not telling.","Meh. The Paris Apartment feels mostly like melodramatic dithering, but I guess I was somewhat entertained.Jess needs a place to stay, so she hits up her half brother. When she arrives at his residence, she finds a fancy building with questionable tenants, but no sign of Ben. As she digs deeper and asks around, she starts to realize that all is not as it seems at this apartment building. Dun dun dun!Having read a few of Lucy Foley's books, I feel like she's really good at building up anticipation. Every moment in this book is so dramatic, with dark shadows and scary sounds at every turn. That's all good, but after a while, it gets to be a bit much, you know? There's no natural ebb and flow in the tone. It's just all high anticipation, all the time.It doesn't help that every character acts so high-strung and paranoid, even when nothing is happening.
I watched as Nick's friend plucked a sprig of rosemary from one of the bushes, tearing hard to wrench it free. How he crushed it to his nose, inhaled. There was something presumptuous about the gesture. It felt like an act of vandalism.
What the heck. Who attacks a bush just to smell it? And who watches someone do that and calls it ""presumptuous""? Reader, if you're able to keep from rolling your eyes, you're a better person than I am.For a book advertised as a mystery, it sure doesn't feel like one. Jess doesn't so much suss out clues as she bumbles around, pilfering stuff, sticking her foot in her mouth, and just generally acts like an incompetent idiot. The other characters are all unlikable too, though each in their own way. And everyone is smelly, with stale breath and excessive sweat.After all that exaggerated writing, do the twists deliver? Eh, they seem pretty standard to me for the genre. I wasn't really surprised or shocked. In fact, it feels more ridiculous than anything else.Still, I was compelled to turn the pages, so I must've been somewhat entertained by all the antics.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Guest ListThe Hunting Party~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
168,Toxic Prey,Mystery,"Gaia is dying.That, at least, is what Dr. Lionel Scott believes. A renowned expert in tropical and infectious diseases, Scott has witnessed the devastating impact of illness and turmoil at critical scale. Society as it exists is untenable, and the direct link to Earth’s death spiral; population levels are out of control and people have allowed disarray and disorder to run rampant. While most are concerned about deadly disease, Scott knows that it is truly humanity itself that will destroy Gaia. It’s only by removing the threat then the planet can continue to prosper, and luckily, Scott is just the right man for the job…When Scott then disappears without a trace, Letty Davenport is tasked with tracking down any and all leads. Scott’s connections to sensitive research into virus and pathogen spread has multiple national and international organizations on high alert, and his shockingly high clearance levels at various institutions, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, make him the last person they’d like to go missing. As the web around Scott becomes more tangled, Letty calls in her father, Lucas, help her lead a group of specialists to find Scott as soon as possible. But as Letty and Lucas begin to uncover startling and disturbing connections between Scott and Gaia conspiracists, their worst fears are confirmed, and it quickly becomes a race to find him before the virus he created becomes the perfect weapon.","It’s been a while since population explosion and control has been at the heart of any thriller I’ve read. But in this, the 34th Lucas Davenport book, a scientist has decided the only way to save the planet is to significantly reduce the number of people living on it. Lionel Scott has spent his career studying infectious diseases, how they spread and the ability to make them more infectious. Now, he’s gone missing. In truth, the book is a Letty and Lucas story and Letty is at the forefront in the action. Lucas and Rae are brought in because of their ability to hunt down people. The book moves along at a brisk clip as the team tries to outthink the villains. For me, it’s important that thrillers stay on this side of the believability line. This one does that, especially given our recent experience with Covid. It works well to have a high level of tension, but with the inevitable downtime. Sandford realizes that even action heroes need to eat and sleep. The action is all within the realm of the possible. Sandford’s writing style is such that it’s easy to envision every scene. I also liked that Sandford has toned Letty down so she’s not some super girl character she displayed in her earlier books. Unlike some of Sandford’s other books, there’s not a lot of humor here. And while this is part of a long standing series, it can be read as a stand-alone. My thanks to Netgalley and Putnam Group for an advance copy of this book.",4.0
169,The Husbands,Fiction,"There’s only one problem—she’s not married. She’s never seen this man before in her life. But according to her friends, her much-improved decor, and the photos on her phone, they’ve been together for years.As Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you’ve taken the right path? When do you stop trying to do better and start actually living?","LESS IS MORE“When Lauren returns home to her flat in London late one night, she is greeted at the door by her husband, Michael. There’s only one problem—she’s not married”.But before she can figure out how she could possibly be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and a different man emerges in his place. And, like a parallel universe, a slightly altered life re-forms around her as well-Same flat, though furnished differently, same friends, though at different stages in their lives, DIFFERENT HUSBAND.If you don’t like the one who climbs down the ladder-send him back to the attic for something and see if you prefer who climbs down the ladder next!😂This unique premise sounded like so much fun BUT I didn’t really care for the execution. By the 50% point Lauren had met and rejected 160 husbands!!!No need to start a flow chart-we DON’T meet them all so we don’t get to know them any better than she did.At the halfway point, a husband emerges who really “gets” her. Will she decide to settle down, or will her quest to find “perfection” continue? I was hoping that this would be a turning point in the book.For me, this would have been better with LESS husbands and MORE of an opportunity to really get to know a couple and root for a favorite !! But, honestly, I didn’t warm up to Lauren and can’t say that I was rooting for her either!As written, I wasn’t quite as satisfied with this story as I had hoped to be, despite the fresh premise and the adorable book cover!A buddy read with DeAnn. Was she more enamored with it? Be sure to watch for her review!! 3 ⭐️ (an average read)AVAILABLE NOWThank You to Doubleday for the gifted copy provided through NetGalley.

170,The Family Upstairs,Thriller,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. The can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.","3.25 confused, restless, is it fair enough to give lower points because you’re die-hard fan of Lisa Jewell fan question flying over my head, creepy, oh those guests should urgently get the hell out of the house stars!  Personally, honestly, I love this author’s work starting from “Watching you”, “Then she was gone”, “I found you”. She is the master evil queen of thrillers taken place in creepy houses and the characters formed in dysfunctional families who have unresolved issues.  So this book is one of them. I enjoyed the prologue. I felt all the goose-bumps on my arm, sweat dripping down my forearm, shivered uncontrollably. My intellectual appetite increased and my level of curiosity hit to the top.  Plot was intriguing: Unwanted and never-leaving guests occupied house and their numbers increased every day till they completely turned into an ominous, cursed and chilling cult, whose members wear ugly shapeless black clothes, chose organic style diet by famishing children. And we met David and Birdie, they’re one of the creepiest couples as like Natural Born Killer’s “Mickey and Mallory”, or any adopted children of Woody Allen and him.  Those parts of the book about Henry, who is probably younger version of Dexter, undiscovered sociopath who hides his unconditional love for Phin, captured my attention. His mother who is about to lose the rest of her marbles, his passive and obedient, weak father and his sister who is suffering from puberty crisis and uncontrollable occupation of CREEPY GUESTS who became THE REAL OWNERS of the house were remarkable and well-rounded characters. The thing I didn’t like and found confusing is way of 3 POV-ed story telling. I got the writer’s motive to put a bridge between past and future and connect three main characters’ stories, mash them in harmony. But the parts are too detailed and you started to feel like you’re drifting apart the main story, the creepy, disturbing guest part and dive into too many details about the other characters’ lives. There are so much enough materials on this book to write two other ones.  Till we reach the encounter of characters and combination part of their stories we may already solve their mystery. Being two steps ahead of the writer doesn’t make me happy!  So I wished we only read about the house’s past, rising of cult, Henry’s searching about paganism and his slow but expected move to the dark side. We already have David and Birdie to be shaken to the core.  The ending of the book was nice touch made me give extra 0.25 stars but I still expected more from this writer and as soon as I saw this book on my dashboard and screamed ( not for seeing my morning self in the mirror, for finding out NetGalley provided me the book, it was one of the happy and joyous screams) and the beginning excited me but the pacing got slower in the middle. It was still good written, detailed, riveting book. Lisa Jewell is one of the best story tellers I’ve ever seen and as a hopeless fan, I will keep happy screaming before starting her upcoming books. But this time, this book didn’t work so much for me!Special thanks to Atria Books and Netgalley to send me this ARC COPY and lighten up my day in exchange my honest review.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",3.0
171,Apples Never Fall,Fiction,". .If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.","I've got to hand it to Liane Moriarty. Just when I think I've seen it all, she comes along and completely surprises me with this sparkling and startling gem of a tale.Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, has disappeared. Her adult children are rightfully aghast, but they're reluctant to report her missing. Because they know the prime suspect will be their father, and they're not really sure of his innocence. When the police start asking questions, it quickly becomes clear everyone in the family has stories to tell and secrets to hide. And before it's all over, everything will be revealed and laid bare.I've really been enjoying stories about dysfunctional families lately, and this is such a superb one. The four siblings are all trying to figure out if their father could've really murdered their mother, and if so, which side would they be on? It's a fascinating premise, and the progression of the story captures all of the nuanced facets that this dilemma would bring to the family.What I've always admired about Moriarty's writing is her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. She has this ability to peel back the layers of family relationships and what it means to be human, and to expose everything ugly and beautiful within, while injecting just that right dose of humor. This book hits upon tender subjects that everyone would recognize as familiar, yet instead of making me cry, it made me laugh.Needless to say, I found this whole thing to be utterly riveting and unputdownable. The characters are memorable, the strife feels all too real, and the dialogue is snappy. I devoured it in just a few days. While the mystery isn't the core of this book, there were still plenty of revelations along the way that kept me surprised and delighted.Liane Moriarty is back! This seemingly simple tale of dysfunctional families and relationships, of people's flaws and the messiness of their lives, of unmet expectations and unspoken dreams, hit all the right notes for me. It feels like Moriarty's last two books have been a little bit off of her true form. But with this one, she again returns to the pinnacle of her craft.My heartfelt thanks for the advance copy that was provided for my honest and unbiased review.",5.0

WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!i have put off writing this review since reading the ARC back in MARCH because i didn't want to poop on anyone else's pre-release anticipation with my less-than-glowing reaction, but now that it's been out for a bit, i'm gonna let my poop out, too. stand back.i didn't get around to reading The Silent Patient until The Great Lockdown of 2020, and it was just the twistyfun distraction i needed from the world, so when i heard that his follow-up was going to be a campus thriller involving seeeeecret societies, classical mythology, and a sinister professor, my The Secret History-loving self was SO EXCITED, and the marketing campaign leading up to its release kindled alla my dark delicious anticipation. and yet.it's just...look, i hate being that guy, but it's just not very good. i'm pretty reasonable about managing my expectations when it comes to summertime psych-suspense thrillery books; they don't gotta be art, they just need to hold my interest and maybe throw a surprise or two my way. escapist entertainment is fine, but i don't like being insulted, and that's what this felt like.QUICKPLOT: mariana is a psychotherapist specializing in group therapy who is still hard-grieving the drowning-death of her beloved husband the previous year. she reluctantly returns to the memory-saturated college campus where their love story began to console her niece/adopted daughter-figure zoe after her best friend tara is found murdered. zoe suspects one of the professors of killing tara, and, encouraged by her former mentor, mariana decides to stick around and do some amateur sleuthing, during which time more girls are murdered. meanwhile, mariana is being low-key stalked by one of her patients from back home, and she meets a younger man who claims to be psychic and is convinced they have a romantic future together, because visions. my first gripe was with the structure. each chapter is about three pages long, which speeds up the pace and prevents the reader from becoming fully immersed in the story—we're just skimmed along through the plot points at a pace seemingly designed to camouflage the fact that there's no development happening; that this is more like an outline of a mystery novel than one fully-realized.the immersion problem is made worse by the frequent insertions of psych-stuff; these clinical asides breaking up the flow:Accompanying the housekeeper on shopping trips to the crowded and frenetic market in the center of Athens always made Mariana nervous. And she was relieved, and a little surprised, to return home unscathed. Large groups continued to intimidate her as she grew older. At school, she found herself on the sidelines, feeling as if she din't fit in with her classmates. And this feeling of not fitting in was hard to shake. Years later, in therapy, she came to understand that the schoolyard was simply a macrocosm of the family unit: meaning her uneasiness was less about the here and now—less about the schoolyard itself, or the market in Athens, or any other group in which she might find herself—and more to do with the family in which she grew up, and the lonely house she grew up in.on the very next page:Mariana grew up with a keen awareness of [her mother's] loss. As a therapist, she knew a baby's first sense of self comes through its parents' gaze. We are born being watched—our parents' expressions, what we see reflected in the mirror of their eyes, determines how we see ourselves. Mariana had lost her mother's gaze—and her father, well, he found it hard to look at her directly.i have a problem with that inserted ""well,"" voice-wise, but the bigger problem is the decision to develop a character thru psych 101 notes. it's...inelegant. i understand that she's a therapist and what she does is bound to inform who she is (which again opens up that whole can of worms re: voice), but these details just don't work in chapters this short; they're not well-integrated into the story, they distance the reader from the character and there's no opportunity to settle back in before we're off to the next chapter. in fact, a lot of this book feels like the author is shoehorning in details from his own personal cache of 'stuff he knows about,' without regard for their narrative utility: psychotherapy, the beauty of the greek islands, greek mythology, the greek language. these recurring motifs take up a lot of real estate at the expense of other story elements, like character development, and they don't do much to enhance the larger story. because here's what's not in his personal cache of 'stuff he knows about:' creating believable characters.NONE of the characters are believable, every interaction is fraught, written as though accompanied by a very intense and cheesy b-movie musical score, everyone all sticky with malice and foreboding. suspend all disbelief, ye who enter here. so. zoe believes professor edward fosca killed tara, claiming that they were having an affair and that, when tara threatened to expose their relationship, fosca threatened her right back and hours later, she turned up dead.edward fosca is a byronically handsome american professor specializing in greek tragedies (natch) who seems to only teach the prettiest girls on campus; several confident, intelligent girls known as the maidens who have formed a tight-knit little secret society based on the persephone myth, and whose education is frequently conducted by fosca in private sessions featuring drugs and alcohol and wild parties but it's not a harem at all, oh no, he's just the light these 20-year-old girlmoths collectively named after virginal ingenues gravitate towards and it's all perfectly normal academia. tara was one of the maidens, but neither fosca nor any of the other young women except zoe seem especially broken up over her death. to contrast grief-responses: mariana is clutching and weeping over her dead spouse's sneakers fourteen months after his death, but an inner-circle maiden dies and the next day these ladies are just fine and dandy, cool and snarky. now, you may well ask yourself why no one would give a little wait, what? about a female-student-collecting prof drinking behind closed doors with all these pretty little maidens, or find the optics of professor mcdreamy striding across campus trailed by an entourage of girls in flowy white dresses on their way to a memorial service...ill-advised? no objections at all, because on this campus, *shrug*, that's just how students learn. when mariana was matriculating, she developed a relationship with her (female) advisor that continues to the present-day, but began with the same kind of boundary-blurring: Most of the teaching...was done on a one-to-one basis, between fellow and student, usually taking place in the fellow's rooms. At any time after midday, or even earlier, at the discretion of the fellow concerned, alcohol was invariably served...providing an education in drinking as well as literature.It also meant that tutorials took on a more personal flavor, and lines between teacher and pupil became blurred—confidences were given, and intimacies exchanged.speaking of exchanged intimacies, fosca is eventually fired because he was, in fact, sleeping with ALL of the maidens. WHAT A COMPLETE SHOCK, SAID NO ONE. maybe shoulda looked into that before the bodies started dropping.mariana may understand that sometimes teachers and students drink together in private rooms and that's a totally normal part of the education process, but she trusts zoe's instincts about fosca's guilt, and he's certainly not acting unshady. cue dialogue:""I can see you have cast me as the villain—a predator preying on my vulnerable students. Except now you're met these young ladies, you can see there's nothing vulnerable about them. Nothing untoward happens at these meetings—it's just a small study group, discussing poetry, enjoying wine and intellectual debate.""""Except now one of those girls is dead.""Professor Fosca frowned. There was an unmistakable flash of anger in his eyes. He stared at her. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?""Mariana looked away, embarrassed by the question. ""No, of course not. I didn't mean—""""Forget it."" He took another drag of his cigarette, all anger apparently gone. ""The word 'psychotherapist,' as you know, comes from the Greek 'psyche,', meaning 'soul,' and 'therapeia,' meaning 'healing.' Are you a healer of souls? Will you heal mine?""""No. Only you can do that.""Fosca dropped his cigarette onto the path. He ground it into the earth with his foot. ""You're determined to dislike me. I don't know why.""i am determined to dislike them both because of how poorly they are written. that dialogue—yeesh. it's contrived and melodramatic and just bad. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?"" really, michaelides? and then the old tonal switcheroo from melodrama to etymological mansplaining her profession to her? you can practically see the red-pen arrow promising ""authentic dialogue TK.""mariana is why we can't have nice things in the 'strong female character' department. i get that she's raw and marinating in grief, borderline hysterical with nostalgia and (figurative) ghosts, but she's impossible to root for. she does not come across as the intelligent, educated woman we are assured she is. while she's able to spew chonks of textbook psych-evaluations about those around her, they come across as reflexive; knee-jerk assessments without any real insight into human behavior. she's in a perma-fog, she responds emotionally in every situation, she misreads every room. she's a poorly drawn caricature: the grieving widow/meddling sleuth that all the men fall for even though it wasn't until sebaaaaastian that she ever felt beautiful blah blah blah. anyway, the guy she thinks is a murderer invites her to dinner at his place and she accepts:Fosca smiled. ""Good...My rooms, at eight? And one more thing—""Before she could stop him, he leaned forward—And he kissed her on the lips.It only lasted a second. By the time Mariana could react, he had already pulled back.Fosca turned and went through the open gate. Mariana heard him whistling as he walked away.She brushed away the kiss with her fist.How dare he?She felt as if she had been assaulted—attacked; and that he had won somehow, succeeded in wrong-footing, intimidating her.what on earth was that? that And one more thing— like he's a predatory columbo.  it's a power move out of a gothic melodrama, complete with the wilting female victim, and whistling? really? that whole scene is so...silly. okay, that covers structure and characters, so i guess plot is next? mariana's involvement in this investigation beggars belief. she is asked by her former advisor to assist in the investigation because 1) she is a group therapist, and the school is like a group, and 2) she used to go to the school. neither of these are qualifications for murder-solving, an elderly professor has no authority to deputize her onto the case, and mariana has a conflict of interest cluttering up her tunnel-vision, but no matter—she agrees and begins conducting her own interviews with various parties, slipping into the deceased's room and pawing through her stuff, hiding in shadows and spying on students and tagging zoe in on her amateur sleuthery, against the protestations of the actual police, whose case she is most definitely compromising. in fact, on page 73 the chief inspector attached to the case tells her to keep out of the investigation, which warning comes before she's even begun her actual snooping. mariana's dubious contributions to the investigation are superfluous—the authorities have already called in a renowned forensic psychologist to consult—a man with whom mariana is acquainted, who light-flirts with her and allows her to sit in on his suspect interviews. because all of this is how things work. i suppose we're meant to see this ignoring-police-mandates stance as plucky? determined? but she stumbles over clues and evidence on her merrily misguided crusade without looping in the people who actually know what they're doing until you just wanna shake her. where i lost my mind was when mariana is led to the location of the murder weapon by a non-police person, and it doesn't even occur to her to object when they remove it from its hidey-hole. i know she's not a professional with a responsibility to preserve evidence, but oh we just allow people to grab murder weapons now, do we? mariana? COME ON, MARIANA!but the real issue i had was with the reveal of whodunnit and why. the motive is dumb, the whole unfurled scope of the murder plot even dumber; an overcomplicated rube goldberg machine built on interlocking assumptions, wishful predictions, and magical thinking from a wholly unqualified strategist. there are at least five things about it that MAKE NO SENSE and the whole thing left me spluttering with outrage. seriously, ____ (proper noun) killed ___(pronoun) ______ (all-caps noun, two words) even though the whole reason for the murder was moot? you don't countermand that plan and find a different way? and ____ (proper noun) didn't recognize ANYTHING from ____'s (proper noun) life in that ___ (noun)? presumably, before ____ (proper noun) went all ______ (disparaging slang), they'd ______ (verb, past tense) about their _____ (noun, plural)?? no?and ____ (proper noun) waited _____ (period of time) before deciding to get ____(adjective)? and ____(verb, past tense) _______ (proper noun) for (noun)? even though _____ (series of facts we are told at the beginning that contradict motive and some math that may or may not be accurate?????????????)and don't get me started on the psychic love-interest. ""I have a gift for that sort of thing, you know—runs in my family—foresight, premonitions. I see things others do not.""so, he's psychic enough to see the future when it involves cartoon bubble-hearts, but he doesn't see ____ (proper noun) ___ (gerund) on the ____ (noun) as he ____ (verb, present tense) by, either IRL or in a vision? a psychic character is silly enough, a psychic character with so many blind-spots is narratively purposeless. and THEN—there's a nice little The Silent Patient connection, but he ruins the moment by bashing the reader over the head with it a couple more times to make sure we noticed, lessening the effect of the shared world, and it left me with the same bad-taste reaction as the similarly-shaped ending of Split, which tie-in-reveal is the only cool thing in an otherwise terrible film. the idea of a group therapist investigating a man who has nurtured a little cultlike group around him is rich with possibility, and the juxtaposition between fosca's ladygroup with henry in mariana's therapy group was so promising: As soon as any group establishes itself, it always arouses envy and attack—and not just from forces on the outside, those excluded from the group, but also from dark and dangerous forces within the group itself. but the execution is so weak—subplots fizzle out, lackluster red herrings (henry-ings?) are dropped unexplored in order to deliver the most ridiculous explanation of all time with no regard for the tradition of fair play in mystery novels. i could do this all day—i haven't even touched upon the postcards, or the on-the-nose focus on revenge tragedies, but i've already gone on so long here that i'm running out of review-space, despite cutting out so many tirade-tangents i don't even know if what's left of the review makes sense anymore, and i've spent so much time rereading chunks of the book to make sure i'm not missing anything that makes the book make sense, and i'm just getting hot and cranky and i want this to be over. this book is getting a lot of positive reviews, and i'm happy for those readers who enjoyed it, but i can't help wondering if maybe the ARC-version i read went through extensive revisions before its final draft because what i read doesn't feel like the product of a three-years-writing-and-revising follow-up to a runaway-success debut novel. The Secret History? more like weak-ret history. *********************************got a postcard in the mail yesterday...directing me to a website with this message: and i cannot wait. three cheers for intriguing marketing strategies!!!come to my blog!",2.0
175,And Then There Were None,Mystery,"First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting.**In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last.
“Be sure thy sin will find thee out.”
Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid. This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? 
“Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.”
If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None, it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies.Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.",4.0
176,Murder on the Orient Express,Mystery,"Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the famous Orient Express in its tracks as it travels through the mountainous Balkans. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year but, by the morning, it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.One of the passengers is none other than detective Hercule Poirot. On vacation. Isolated and with a killer on board, Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.","I’m pretty astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but “early-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime” doesn’t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it’s completely cool ok???Let’s discuss the very limited number of things I won’t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you’re a detective too, and if that’s not the dream I don’t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don’t, I’d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn’t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I’m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie’s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That’s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people’s individual psychology. That would’ve upset me, probably, if it weren’t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written! I could’ve replaced this whole review with those adjectives and been much more convincing.---------------pre-reviewTHAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING!(I hope you read that in Aziz Ansari's voice.

177,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Fiction,"Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and entertainingly atmospheric novel.","I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0

The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him. He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his computer shows strange searches. He says they weren't made by him. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone.So what did happen to Nick's beautiful wife?","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0

I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down.

Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0
180,The Da Vinci Code,Fiction,"ISBN 9780307277671 moved to this edition.While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
181,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
182,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Mystery,"Agatha Christie's debut novel was also the first to feature Hercule Poirot, her famously eccentric Belgian detective. A refugee of the Great War, Poirot has settled in England near Styles Court, the country estate of his wealthy benefactor, the elderly Emily Inglethorp. When Emily is poisoned and the authorities are baffled, Poirot puts his prodigious sleuthing skills to work. Suspects are plentiful, including the victim’s much younger husband, her resentful stepsons, her longtime hired companion, a young family friend working as a nurse, and a London specialist on poisons who just happens to be visiting the nearby village. All of them have secrets they are desperate to keep, but none can outwit Poirot as he navigates the ingenious red herrings and plot twists that contribute to Agatha Christie's well-deserved reputation as the queen of mystery.Librarian's note: the first fifteen novels in the Hercule Poirot series are 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920; 2) The Murder on the Links, 1923; 3) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 1926; 4) The Big Four, 1927; 5) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 1928; 6) Peril at End House, 1932; 7) Lord Edgware Dies, 1933; 8) Murder on the Orient Express, 1934; 9) Three Act Tragedy, 1935; 10) Death in the Clouds, 1935; 11) The A.B.C. Murders, 1936; 12) Murder in Mesopotamia, 1936; 13) Cards on the Table, 1936; 14) Dumb Witness, 1937; and 15) Death on the Nile, 1937. These are just the novels; Poirot also appears in this period in a play, Black Coffee, 1930, and two collections of short stories, Poirot Investigates, 1924, and Murder in the Mews, 1937. Each novel, play and short story has its own entry on Goodreads.","""Dear me, Poirot,"" I said with a sigh, ""I think you have explained everything! And how wonderful of you to wait until page 230 to finally shed light on all your absurd behavior throughout the book, and to justify and the red herrings and narrative padding! But of course, it could only be so in the classic style of a fiendish murder mystery! Why, in fact, though this is but the first case we have solved together, I have no doubt we could do the exact same thing as many as 86 more times, depending on if you count the smaller cases!""""Quite so, mon ami,"" Poirot chuckled. ""You make such a reliably dim-witted Watson!""I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the little man! Then we drank some tea and he kissed me passionately, on the mouth.",2.0
183,The Silent Patient,Thriller,"A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0

Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose?Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.","What a marvelous, delectable read! There was something so addictive about this book; it felt at times distinctly young adult while also having moments that felt so well done it was beyond the stereotype of what a teenage thriller tends to be. It’s taken me 4 days just to collect my thoughts to the point that I can attempt writing a proper review, and I’m certain this will be one of the most talked about books in the YA genre this Spring/Summer season. My issues with this book were minor, and I’ll get to those later, but when I first picked up this book I knew I would enjoy it based on the description stating “Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars”, two things I love to pieces. While this was in some ways a traditional whodunnit, I believe many of the minor influences were the reason this novel reads so well.According the the books I’ve logged on Goodreads, I’ve managed to read over 700 mystery, thriller, and suspense novels. That is an overwhelming number of books that tend to be fiercely judged on their ability to provide a solid, mind-blowing twist. The reason I mention this is due to the fact that it is very difficult for me to pick up a mystery and not have it solved in the first 10% if the clues are provided; otherwise, I typically pick it up when said character is first introduced into the narrative. One of Us Is Lying is bound to be one of many fabulous novels that gets thrown into that category and is scrutinized solely by it’s ability to keep the reader guessing “whodunnit” until the big reveal. Again, I mention this because I think it would be a grave mistake for the reader to be so focused on this aspect when the book has so much more to offer! Personally, I had it figured out in the first chapter. As stated in the summary, the pieces are there for the reader to put together if they are clever enough. I applaud the author for her cleverness and storytelling abilities; there will be many readers who will be fooled by the red herrings and receive that glorious 
AHA
 moment at the big reveal. Why am I rambling on about this you ask? I really want to drive home the point of what makes this book stand out from others that are similar.The Characters. It is a rare day indeed that I find fleshed out, grounded, relatable characters that draw me in to a young adult narrative the way that these did here. My 
AHA
 moment may not have come during the big twist, but it certainly came in waves abounding throughout my experience journeying with these various high school kids. I was sure this would be another read with those stereotypical teenagers that give contemporary YA novels a bad rep; for crying out loud the stereotypes are printed on the inside of the book cover in the description! I think this was a clever move by the publisher and author; if other readers pull the same underestimation as I did, they will be more than pleasantly surprised at what they get out of this book. In referral to the wrapping up of characters and not the twist, the ending was one of the best I’ve seen in awhile. There is no gag worthy happily ever after where everyone is perfectly paired up in couples and they ride off into the sunset on their baby unicorns while the sun beats down on their pimple free faces…. No, while there are some upbeats moments, the ending is messy and real and I welcomed it whole heartedly. People made mistakes beyond the central narrative and there were consequences and some things were left open-ended in the way that makes you wonder what their eventual decisions lead to. I’m extremely pleased that the author chose to take some risky leeway with her writing direction and applaud her with a standing ovation.Alright, I said I would get to the minor issues and I kind of lied. Please don’t hate me, but there was a tiny aspect of this book that I thought I could get past, and even though I can’t discuss it outright (because these spoilers involve blowing the entire plot of the book), my conscience just wouldn’t let me finish this review without mentioning them in the broadest of terms. Again, I applaud the author for tackling some really tough issues and concerns in this book, and I don’t think she wrote anything wrong on her end. I think it’s more of an issue I’ve seen present itself across a wide number of YA books recently. Some who may be dealing with mental illness may perceive the outcome of this novel in an unrealistic way and I can see the possibility of various readers being split on their opinions of some of the content presented. I will say, I feel it was handled better in this book than in others I have read previously. As always, if you’ve read this book early or once you have a chance to read it and would like to discuss, please feel free to private message me and I’ll gladly have a respectful chat with you.This is a review I’ve been struggling to write for a few days now and I hope I’ve done it justice. There just aren’t words to describe how completely readable this book really is. McManus did such a fabulous job of making me just as interested in the individual secrets and side stories of the “Murder Club” as I was in the central mystery surrounding Simon’s death. The author had me convinced that this couldn’t possibly be her debut novel, and if this is what she has published first, I can only imagine the treats we will receive in written form from her down the road. I’m a committed fan now and I can’t wait to see what she publishes next. Highly recommended to teens, sure, but I think loads of adults are going to enjoy this one as well. There’s something really special and unique to this story that defies the boundaries of age gaps and will have me remembering it for months to come.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy; it was a pleasure to post my honest thoughts here.",4.0

The Written Review
 Read this one for TCE book club! 
 If this isn’t hell, the devil is surely taking notes.
Lord and Lady Hardcastle are throwing a ""party"" at Blackheath, their crumbling British mansion.This so-called-party takes place on the anniversary of their son's murder (19 years ago), includes the exact same guests as it did so many years ago.And, during the night, trusts will be violated, truths will be exposed and above all, their daughter, Evelyn Hardcastle will be murdered.Aidan Bishop, along with two others,  are in competition to be the first to discover Evelyn Hardcastle's murderer.
Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded.
Bishop relives the night of Evelyn's murder for eight days, and each day he is in a different body and has a new chance to find the murderer. 
Life doesn’t always leave you a choice in how you live it.
The first day, Bishop wakes up in Dr. Sebastian Bell's body, without a clue as to where he is and what he is supposed to do.The second day, Bishop wakes up in the butler's body...but ""past-Bishop"" is also inhabiting Bell's body. Which leads to a lot of confusion and surprise.The third day, there's current-Bishop, past-Bishop and past-past-Bishop....well you get the point. Each day Bishop adds another ""character"" under his belt. He gets eight bodies, and eight days, to piece together the mystery. The two others who are in competition with Bishop are unknown to him and are also inhabiting bodies (though, unlike him, they cannot swap and every ""day"" their memories reset). They are all racing to find out the murderer, because whoever can figure out this mystery is the winner.And the winner? 
The winner gets to escape.

How lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?
This book was confusing in the best way possible.I could barely write my summary - there's just so many layers of complexity and betrayals and everything.So effing impressed. I was wholly ensnared by the mystery - I hardly knew what to think or where to look - but it was such a fun and wild ride that I didn't care.Aiden Bishop was a wonderfully fleshed-out character and Turton did a particularly excellent job with the various bodies that Bishop possessed.In particular, I loved how each body Bishop possessed would begin to influence him. When he was Dr. Sebastian Bell, Bishop was meek, under the butler's influence Bishop became moralistic and so on. It was fascinating to watch how that played out.The only thing that threw me slightly was the end. The build to the climax and the ending were superb...but the actual grand reveal was a bit of a letdown.I honestly don't know what I as expecting, just something a bit ""more"" - if that makes any sense...All I know is that this is an author to watch. 
I cannot wait to see what Turton writes next!!

We are never more ourselves than when we think people aren’t watching.

You can just ignore these points.____________________________Things you should know: 1) Ms Rowling filled my childhood and early teen years with magic. I love Harry Potter and I confess to only adding this book after I found out she was the author. 2) I did not go into this with the intention to compare it to Harry Potter. I did not expect magic or wizards and I fully anticipated this being very different to the HP books. 3) I have read and enjoyed many mystery/crime novels in the past. My favourites being by Tana French and Gillian Flynn. So, there was no reason why I couldn't have enjoyed this book simply because it wasn't magical Potterland. But I didn't and, after putting a lot of thought into this, I think I finally understand why.Here's the sad truth: I can't stand Rowling's writing when she writes for adults. I actually find it painful to read. Let's be clear from the beginning, I started and never finished The Casual Vacancy because the opening didn't grab me and there was something about it - something which I couldn't put my finger on - that made it an effort to get through. A certain style to the writing which didn't agree with me. I thought perhaps it was a one-off because I'd read all her other works and never had a problem with her writing style. That's why I jumped at the chance to try another adult book by Rowling and sort out what was evidently a bout of silliness on my part. What this book did give me was an answer to why neither of Rowling's adult books worked for me.Rowling writes in an unusual manner. It's not unique to her work for adults, Harry Potter has it too, but the effect had on both is very different. Rowling's style of writing, including the dialogue between characters, is formal to the point of being old-fashioned. Part of me wants to compare it to Austen but I'm cautious of doing so because of the amount of people (usually including myself) who might read that as a compliment. Rowling's formal style doesn't work, for me, when using it in an adult mystery and pairing it with profanity and grisly murders. It feels out of place and weighs down each page with tedious descriptions that use too many awkward similes, metaphors and adjectives. ""...face the colour of corned beef...""""...the snow fell with soft fingertip plunks...""""...long-snouted cameras...""Her descriptions all felt a bit off to me. And I particularly didn't like the unsophisticated use of big words. It's like when inexperienced indie authors go crazy with thesaurus.com, using clunky words like ""exacerbated"" and ""exorbitant"" in casual sentences that don't benefit from it. The characters in this book never check the time or look at their watches, they ""consult"" their watches. Think I'm being picky? Try reading whole pages where every sentence replaces the obvious words with complex ones and see how far you get without your brain starting to scream. And it felt like every single noun had at least one adjective before it. Not only that, but Rowling repeats similar adjectives when referring to the objects again. In one sentence, we are told she climbed the ""steel stairs"" and in the next she's continuing up the ""metal stairs"". WHY???? And also WHYYYYYY???Another example of Rowling's old-fashioned style is her frequent use of expressions like ""oh my!"" and ""goodness!"", expressions I'm sure some of you will recognise from Harry Potter characters. What is this? It's like Mary Poppins or Little Women or, I don't know, Little House on the Prairie. And maybe it works fine in all of those, same as it works fine in Harry Potter, but none of those also had a side-helping of profanity and very adult themes. They do all, however, share the formal language style.And while I think people were silly to say things about The Casual Vacancy like ""ohmigod this had, like, noooooo magic and even fewer dark lords"" when Rowling clearly said it was an adult mystery book and I wanted to say to those silly people:I still think it's entirely relevant to compare the two when looking at Rowling's writing style and the reason why sometimes it works and sometimes it really doesn't. The formal tone with simplistic language - like in Harry Potter - is okay, but dense descriptions and over-complicated sentences made it hard work and tedious in this book. It's like a very formal letter with the occasional random swear word thrown in. And it doesn't work. Not for me, anyway. The style simply doesn't fit the content; there's swearing and murders and people rescuing others by grabbing their breasts...I'm not even going to talk about the story beyond saying I found it a standard mystery that could have been good if I'd not had these other reasons for not liking it. The killer is not hard to guess for anyone familiar with crime mysteries but that isn't usually what I care about most in crime mysteries anyway. Plus, in this case, I'm just too blinded by my dislike for the writing. *sigh* I think it's fair to say that I'm finally done trying to enjoy Rowling's adult books.P.S. Yes, I did get a little overexcited when I googled Mary Poppins gifs.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",1.0
187,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,Mystery,"Considered to be one of Agatha Christie's greatest, and also most controversial mysteries, 'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' breaks the rules of traditional mystery. The peaceful English village of King’s Abbot is stunned. The widow Ferrars dies from an overdose of Veronal. Not twenty-four hours later, Roger Ackroyd—the man she had planned to marry—is murdered. It is a baffling case involving blackmail and death that taxes Hercule Poirot’s “little grey cells” before he reaches one of the most startling conclusions of his career.Librarian's note: the first fifteen novels in the Hercule Poirot series are 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920; 2) The Murder on the Links, 1923; 3) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 1926; 4) The Big Four, 1927; 5) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 1928; 6) Peril at End House, 1932; 7) Lord Edgware Dies, 1933; 8) Murder on the Orient Express, 1934; 9) Three Act Tragedy, 1935; 10) Death in the Clouds, 1935; 11) The A.B.C. Murders, 1936; 12) Murder in Mesopotamia, 1936; 13) Cards on the Table, 1936; 14) Dumb Witness, 1937; and 15) Death on the Nile, 1937. These are just the novels; Poirot also appears in this period in a play, Black Coffee, 1930, and two collections of short stories, Poirot Investigates, 1924, and Murder in the Mews, 1937. Each novel, play and short story has its own entry on Goodreads.","I went into this book with a bit of an attitude. Roger Ackroyd is the only Agatha Christie book featured on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, and I was skeptical about the List's claim that this was the only Christie book worth reading. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I think the List is right on this one. At least a little - I'm definitely not suggesting that you should read this book and then never pick up a Christie novel ever again, but if you find yourself in a situation where you're going to spend a month on a desert island and can only bring one book, and the only books you've been offered are from the Agatha Christie canon, you should pick this one. The ending (which I will not discuss in explicit detail for fear of spoilers) is what makes this a 5-star book. Let me assure you: you will not guess who the murderer is. Never ever ever. When the murderer is revealed, you will not believe. When the murderer goes on to explain his/her actions, you will continue to not believe it. Only by rereading certain important passages will you start to realize that the answer was in front of you all the time, and you couldn't see it. It's a testament to Christie's skill as a writer that this is accomplished. And, having now read a Miss Marple mystery, I'm going to choose a side: I'm officially Team Hercule. He is silly and self-centered and ridiculous and funny and all I want to do is pinch his cheeks and then go sit in a cafe with him and eat croissants. My favorite part of the book is when Poirot makes his grand entrance. The narrator, Dr. Sheppard, is in his garden when someone throws a vegetable marrow over the wall. A second later, the doctor's new neighbor pokes his ""egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes"" over the garden wall and attempts to explain himself:""I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense. For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I enrage myself with the marrows. I send them to promenade themselves - alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.""",5.0

189,The Inheritance Games,Mystery,"Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why -- or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch -- and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a conwoman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.","THERAPY!!! THERAPY FOR ALL OF YOU! my thoughts (mild spoilers ahead)• i ain't never seen four emotionally intelligent brothers. two of them always gotta have unaddressed trauma.• the young adult threshold for personality is in HELL. all you need to do is give your teenage main character a vaguely tragic past, enough stubbornness to allow her to mildly bump heads with love interests every once in a while, a weakness for hot emotionally unavailable rich boys, and a best friend of color to carry things (for flavor).• not this billionaire secretly surveilling a low income teenage girl for most of her adolescence while she's struggling to stay afloat and literally living out of her car? taking and saving photos of her without her knowledge? and hoarding his wealth all the while? while she's barely scraping by? until the day he dies and finally decides—now that he no longer needs that wealth—it'll all go to her in exchange for using her as a pawn in his family's trauma olympics? GUILLOTINE!• LIKE? ARE YOU DERANGED? JUST HIRE A FAMILY THERAPIST? YOU LITERALLY HAVE EVERY RESOURCE AT YOUR DISPOSAL?• i clocked the endgame from the moment the hawthorne brothers were introduced, which is always irritating, because love triangles only really work (at least for me) when there seems to be a genuine struggle to decide between two equally interesting, three dimensional characters. • not to get into semantics, but if faced with a choice between two rich white boys, why NOT PICK THE ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIST? WHO IS GENTLE AND FORGIVING? AND WASN'T PLAYING A BULLSHIT HOT AND COLD GAME WITH AVERY'S HEART BECAUSE HE IS EMOTIONALLY UNHINGED WITH THE MENTAL MATURITY OF A 13 YEAR OLD GTA GAMER?• this is how all of jameson and avery's interactions went:""can you point me to the bathroom?"" i asked.""he who leaves the game, loses, heiress,"" he said.""please, i really have to pee, can you just—""""the ball always looks for the best player,"" he replied with the glint of a grin, cutting me off.""jameson, please—""""play alone and you’re bound to win, mystery girl.""• THIS MAN DID NOT HAVE A PERSONALITY. HE WAS JUST A TRENCH COAT OF FORTUNE COOKIE QUOTES. FLEXED HIS ABS A LITTLE AND CALLED IT A DAY. • the amount of times the narrator repeats lines of dialogue verbatim in her head did in fact give me a migraine. • xander was the best brother—a puppy, if you will—and i stand by that.• this was textbook young adult in that i could feel the plot mechanics moving as i zipped through the pages. the inheritance games is very much a predictable ""mystery"" that ended up slowed down by the tediousness of a love triangle i still don't really buy.• HOW OLD IS AVERY? are we ever gonna ask that? because she's interacting romantically with adult men as a minor? just wondering hehe• on that note, this concept would have been so much better if the characters were all college-aged. imagine the shock, the intrigue, the comedy of a low income, jeff bezos-hating college student with loans out the ass suddenly coming into billions? and having to live with two hot white guys? this concept is a lot funnier than it was written. buying into a high school girl solving a billionaire's years-long puzzle and catching the attention of the 18 + 19 year old brothers while she's at it is just a bit too much of a stretch, even for ya.• i also can't get over the whole emily subplot. this book was literally just....avery: Mf's be in relationships with their dead cheating Gf for like 3-5 years 😒 like damn other ppl wanna date you too 🙋‍♂️❗️😂🤣 and for most of the novel, that is exactly how jameson and grayson act. then 75% in, jameson suddenly changes his tune and goes the whole ""i actually don't care about emily at all despite constant references to and comparisons between you and her” route. like, okay, buddy. having said all of that, yes, i will be picking up book two for gay ally and HoC (Hawthorne of Color) xander.",3.0
190,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
191,The Last Murder at the End of the World,Mystery,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death. And then they learn that the murder has triggered a lowering of the security system around the island, the only thing that was keeping the fog at bay. If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.",Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...,2.0
192,The Great Divide,Historical Fiction,"An epic novel of the construction of the Panama Canal, casting light on the unsung people who lived, loved, and labored there.It is said that the canal will be the greatest feat of engineering in history. But first, it must be built. For Francisco, a local fisherman who resents the foreign powers clamoring for a slice of his country, nothing is more upsetting than the decision of his son, Omar, to work as a digger in the excavation zone. But for Omar, whose upbringing was quiet and lonely, this job offers a chance to finally find connection.Ada Bunting is a bold sixteen-year-old from Barbados who arrives in Panama as a stowaway alongside thousands of other West Indians seeking work. Alone and with no resources, she is determined to find a job that will earn enough money for her ailing sister’s surgery. When she sees a young man—Omar—who has collapsed after a grueling shift, she is the only one who rushes to his aid.John Oswald has dedicated his life to scientific research and has journeyed to Panama in single-minded pursuit of one goal: eliminating malaria. But now, his wife, Marian, has fallen ill herself, and when he witnesses Ada’s bravery and compassion, he hires her on the spot as a caregiver. This fateful decision sets in motion a sweeping tale of ambition, loyalty, and sacrifice. Searing and empathetic, The Great Divide explores the intersecting lives of activists, fishmongers, laborers, journalists, neighbors, doctors, and soothsayers—those rarely acknowledged by history even as they carved out its course.","I love stories that take me to foreign countries where I’m able to become immersed in different cultures.Panama is one such country.The history of the canal is fascinating. How America stormed in and offered Columbia $$ to give Panama its independence. It wasn’t a selfless gesture, however, America wanted a canal for their own economic needs.This is a story of those who came to help build, resist the build and those to reclaim what was rightfully theirs. There are those who travelled from across the country and from across the sea.As much as I loved the intent of this story and the characters, it fell short for me. Henriquez created such marvellous characters yet, she failed on developing any of them through. We have a young Ada who travelled from Barbados to get a job to pay for her sister’s surgery; Omar who was looking more from his life, takes a job working in the canal that mutes his father speechless as he is shamed by it; Valentina ready to lead the town to protest the dam required for the canal; and so many other fascinating characters.The story did merge beautifully yet I was still left wanting: More of some characters, less of others; more of the impacts of the canal.Overall a solid 4⭐️",4.0
193,James,Historical Fiction,"A brilliant, action-packed reimagining of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , both harrowing and ferociously funny, told from the enslaved Jim's point of view.When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond.While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river’s banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin…), Jim’s agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.","Whoa, that was so not was I was expecting. Despite the Goodreads blurb that calls this book “ferociously funny” and “brimming with electrifying humor,” I didn't really find much to laugh about while reading it. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was just surprised by how serious and thought-provoking this novel ended up being. I mean, sure, there are a few funny bits here and there, but I definitely wouldn't consider this to be a humorous book overall.But, with that said, James is a brilliant piece of fiction and I have once again been wowed by Percival Everett's talent. (As an aside, if you want to read a truly funny book by Everett, grab yourself a copy of The Trees. It's amazing.) Everett manages to stay true to the tone and style of 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
 while at the same time creating something completely different with runaway slave Jim as the narrator.This is not an easy book to read … well, subject-wise, anyway. Lots of terrible things happen to good people, mostly just because of the color of their skin. There are awful characters who degrade and take advantage of Jim just because they can. There is murder and rape and violence and death. I've read books about slavery before, but somehow this one brought home the inhumanity of it like no other. I foresee lots of challenges to this book by the “slavery wasn't really all that bad,” red hat-wearing, book-burning crowd.I flew through this book and found it basically unputdownable. I read the first 80% in one sitting, forced myself to go to bed around 3 a.m., and then finished the last bit first thing the next morning. It's exciting and suspenseful and heart-wrenching all at the same time, and the ending was fantastic.If you enjoyed the original Huck Finn, you'll probably love this version at least as much, if not more. Percival Everett is an incredibly talented author and a national treasure, and this latest book of his deserves all of the praise and recognition that will undoubtedly come its way.Many thanks to NetGalley and Doubleday for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0

As she attempts to straddle both worlds, she stumbles upon Anita’s story, raising questions about the dynamics of her own relationship, which eerily mirrors that of the forgotten artist.Moving back and forth through time and told from the perspectives of both women, Anita de Monte Laughs Last is a propulsive, witty examination of power, love, and art, daring to ask who gets to be remembered and who is left behind in the rarefied world of the elite.",may ana mendieta's memory live forever.i just wish i could find her real name in this book.(review to come / thanks to the publisher for the e-arc),3.0

3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
197,The Princess of Las Vegas,Mystery,"A Princess Diana impersonator and her estranged sister find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of money and murder in this twisting tale of organized crime, cryptocurrency, and family secrets on the Las Vegas strip.Crissy Dowling has created a world that suits her perfectly. She passes her days by the pool in a private cabana, she splurges on ice cream but never gains an ounce, and each evening she transforms into a Princess, performing her musical cabaret inspired by the life of the late Diana Spencer. Some might find her strange or even delusional, an American speaking with a British accent, hair feathered into a style thirty years old, living and working in a casino that has become a dated trash heap. On top of that, Crissy’s daily diet of Adderall and Valium leaves her more than a little tipsy, her Senator boyfriend has gone back to his wife, and her entire career rests on resembling a dead woman. And yet, fans see her for the gifted chameleon she is, showering her with gifts, letters, and standing ovations night after night. But when Crissy’s sister, Betsy, arrives in town with a new boyfriend and a teenage daughter, and when Richie Morley, the owner of the Buckingham Palace Casino, is savagely murdered, Crissy’s carefully constructed kingdom comes crashing down all around her. A riveting tale of identity, obsession, fintech, and high-tech mobsters, The Princess of Las Vegas is an addictive, wildly original thriller from one of our most extraordinary storytellers.","This had a very strong start that quickly became bogged down by a dumb as a box of rocks MC, and an unrealistic foster child who is a brilliant child prodigy. The crypto currency and mobster side plots bored me to tears. The direction the book would take was telegraphed from the beginning: A Princess Di look-alike who has a residency in Las Vegas? A sister who looks just like her, who gets involved in a shady cryptocurrency deal? Predictable, but the ending was so convoluted my eyes glazed over. This was a buddy read with Marialyce, and sadly, not one we’d recommend.",2.0
199,The Other Side of Disappearing,Romance,"Ever since their reckless mother ran off with a boyfriend she’d known only a few months, Jess has been aware that he’s the same accomplished con man who was the subject of a wildly popular podcast, The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore. Now thirty-one, Jess didn’t bargain on Tegan eventually piecing together the connection for herself. But Tegan plans to do exactly what Jess has always feared—leave their safe, stable home to search for their mother—and she’ll be accompanied by the prying podcast host and her watchful, handsome producer, Adam Hawkins. Unwilling to let the sister she’s spent so much of her life protecting go it alone, Jess reluctantly joins them. Together, the four make their way across the country, unraveling the mystery of where the couple disappeared to and why. But soon Jess is discovering other things too. Like a renewed sense of vulnerability and curiosity, and a willingness to expand beyond the walls she’s so carefully built. And in Adam, she finds an unexpected connection she didn’t even know was missing, if only she can let go and let him in . . .","Kate Clayborn has done it again, composing a symphony by playing the strings of readers' devoted hearts. This heartwarming, genuine, and inspirational story delves into the lives of people who disappear from our lives, taking parts of us with them and leaving us feeling like half-empty shelves.The narrative beautifully explores realistic dysfunctional family dynamics, sisterhood, self-discovery, and healing wounds, all blended into a poignant love story. The unique and complex bond between sisters is particularly moving, bringing forth torrents of emotion that had me shedding tears.Let's meet hairstylist Jess Greene, who hides behind thick emotional barriers, having no intention of letting anyone in. She harbors secrets about her mother, who left her and her stepsister Tegan ten years ago when Jess was only 8. This event shattered her trust in people, forcing her to live like a shell of herself.

Tegan becomes enamored with Salem Durant, a popular podcaster whose show, ""The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore,"" becomes a viral sensation. Jess realizes that Salem is investigating the same conman who promised her a one-on-one interview that never materialized.

Along the way, she slowly lets down her emotional barriers to allow Adam in. He demonstrates patience in earning her trust, revealing his own vulnerable parts and sharing his grief about a teammate who lost the battle against mental illness.The four of them traverse the country to unravel the mystery of the conman and his lover, the girls' mother. This journey becomes an inner exploration, forcing them to confront lost parts and fears that have prevented them from living their lives fully.Overall, this is an amazing self-exploration journey, a genuine sisterhood story, and a blossoming romance between Jess and Adam that warms the heart. Adam, with his cinnamon bun demeanor disguised under a giant facade, possesses all the qualities of the best book boyfriend. I recommend this book to anyone seeking something inspirational, soul-healing, and positive to lighten their mood.Many thanks to NetGalley and Kensington Books for sharing this lovely book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

The characterization is the main and supporting characters is excellent.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel. The characters were likeable and the focus was on women, the roles others wanted for them, what the women wanted for themselves, and the challenges they faced in achieving them. Other themes included friendship, family, life choices, wartime danger, community, found family, sacrifice, volunteerism, treatment of others, the power of books, hope, and romance.Overall, I learned a lot about these women who had a vision and pursued it relentlessly as well as about the library itself and the internment camps on the Isle of Man. The excellent characterization made this book special. The author did significant research and I recommend reading her note after completing the novel.Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine, Ballantine Books and Jennifer Ryan provided a digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

201,The Morningside,Fiction,"From the critically beloved, New York Times bestselling author of The Tiger's Wife and Inland, a magical novel of mothers and daughters, displacement and belonging, and myths both old and new.There’s the world you can see. And then there’s the one you can’t. Welcome to the Morningside.After being expelled from their ancestral home, Silvia and her mother finally settle at the Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family's past. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she know why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia's lonely and impoverished reality.Enchanted by Ena’s stories, Silvia begins seeing the world with magical possibilities and becomes obsessed with the mysterious older woman who lives in the penthouse of the Morningside. Bezi Duras is an enigma to everyone in the building. She has her own elevator entrance and leaves only to go out at night and walk her three massive hounds, often not returning until the early morning. Silvia’s mission to unravel the truth about this woman’s life, and her own haunted past, may end up costing her everything.Startling, inventive, and profoundly moving, The Morningside is a novel about the stories we tell—and the stories we refuse to tell—to make sense of where we came from and who we hope we might become.","The Morningside by Téa Obreht is a Family and Literary Fiction Story Sprinkled With Magical Realism and Set in a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic World! 
Holy-Moly! There's a lot going on in this story...
Silvia knows little about where she's from, why they had to leave, or why her mother keeps their past so secretive. The only thing she knows is now they're living at The Morningside, an aging luxury high-rise in Island City where her Aunt Ena has lived and worked for the past ten years.  Silvia loves her conversations with Aunt Ena, who feeds her imagination with stories about the homeland she doesn't remember. Silvia becomes enamored by Ena's tales and her imagination spills over with thoughts about the mysterious resident living in the penthouse. She makes it her focus to discover the truth about this woman's life... The Morningside is a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic story written in the first-person narrative of curious eleven-year-old Silvia. Silvia is quiet, bright, and observant and possesses keen senses for a child her age. Perhaps it's due to being raised by a mother who shares little that Silvia is driven to find answers on her own. Silvia meets two individuals she develops friendships with and it's through these connections the story becomes more about the characters and relationships and less about the changing world described in Obreht's lovely writing. The story can feel cramped with melodrama and distractions, jumping from one catastrophe to the next, and taking abrupt turns through unexpected decisions by the characters. For me, it added additional layers and interest.The Morningside is creative and original storytelling about a mother-daughter relationship, finding family, and discovering your place in the world. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a well-written character-driven Family and Literary Fiction story with touches of Magical Realism like I do. I plan to look at Téa Obreht's backlist for more to read while I wait for her next book!4⭐Thank you to Random House and Téa Obreht for a physical ARC, and a DRC of this book through NetGalley.

202,The Day Tripper,Time Travel,"It’s 1995, and Alex Dean has it all: a spot at Cambridge University next year, the love of an amazing woman named Holly and all the time in the world ahead of him. That is until a brutal encounter with a ghost from his past sees him beaten, battered and almost drowning in the Thames.He wakes the next day to find he’s in a messy, derelict room he’s never seen before, in grimy clothes he doesn’t recognize, with no idea of how he got there. A glimpse in the mirror tells him he’s older—much older—and has been living a hard life, his features ravaged by time and poor decisions. He snatches a newspaper and finds it’s 2010—fifteen years since the fight.After finally drifting off to sleep, Alex wakes the following morning to find it’s now 2019, another nine years later. But the next day, it’s 1999. Never knowing which day is coming, he begins to piece together what happens in his life after that fateful night by the river.But what exactly is going on? Why does his life look nothing like he thought it would? What about Cambridge, and Holly? In this thrilling adventure, Alex must navigate his way through the years to learn that small actions have untold impact. And that might be all he needs to save the people he loves and, equally importantly, himself.","The story in this book starts in 1995 when Alex Dean is a young man who met the love of his life and has a bright future ahead of him. Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion. It leaves us to wonder and analyze our own lives to decide that we made the best decisions in the course of it.",4.0
203,If the Tide Turns,Historical Fiction,"1715, Eastham, Massachusetts: As the daughter of a wealthy family, Maria Brown has a secure future mapped out for her, yet it is not the future she wants. Young, headstrong, and restless, Maria has no desire to marry the aging, mean-spirited John Hallett, regardless of his fortune and her parents’ wishes. As for what Maria does want—only one person has ever even asked her that question.Samuel Bellamy, an orphaned sailor searching for work, meets Maria by chance, enthralling her with talk of far-flung places and blasphemous ideals. But neither is free from the social order into which they were born. When Sam is banished from Maria’s parents’ home after asking for her hand, he vows to return a wealthy man, and Maria promises to keep the faith until then.Sam is drawn into piracy and discovers a brotherhood more equal and fulfilling than any on land, despite its dangers. Beguiled by the chance to both fight for justice and make a fortune to bring home to Maria, Sam is torn between duty to his crew and his desire to return. Separated by more than just the ocean, time slips by as Sam and Maria cling to their love for each other. Maria is determined to stay strong in her conviction in Sam, but as rumors swirl and her position in Eastham turns perilous, Maria is forced into an impossible decision.Now, on a journey no less treacherous and eventful than Sam’s, Maria draws on every shred of her courage and resilience not merely to survive, but to honor her own yearning for freedom . . .","Maria Brown’s parents are very strict, they want her to marry and the man is much older than her and she finds him repulsive. Maria is very headstrong and determined, she has premonitions and can sometimes see what’s going to happen in the future. Her mother has told her to never mention this to anyone, the Salem Witch Trials took place only a couple of decades ago and she risks being burned at the stake.

Maria's determined to wait for Sam, but her parents are putting pressure on her to marry, Sam thinks she’s waiting for him and Maria is getting desperate in Eastham, Massachusetts. I received a copy of If the Tide Turns by Rachel Rueckert from Kensington Publishing and Edelweiss Plus in exchange for an honest review. The well written debut novel is told from the points of view of Maria and Sam and inspired by a real-life pirate Sam Bellamy. The reader's given an idea of what piracy was really like in the early 1700's, life in Colonial America, use of herbal medicine, banishment of women, evils of slavery and the plight of the Native American Wampanoag people. An historical saga about the lure of the sea, overcoming obstacles, young love and four stars from me.",4.0
204,Becoming Madam Secretary,Historical Fiction,"Raised on tales of her revolutionary ancestors, Frances Perkins arrives in New York City at the turn of the century, armed with her trusty parasol and an unyielding determination to make a difference.When she’s not working with children in the crowded tenements in Hell’s Kitchen, Frances throws herself into the social scene in Greenwich Village, befriending an eclectic group of politicians, artists, and activists, including the millionaire socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, the flirtatious budding author Sinclair Lewis, and the brilliant but troubled reformer Paul Wilson, with whom she falls deeply in love.But when Frances meets a young lawyer named Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a tea dance, sparks fly in all the wrong directions. She thinks he’s a rich, arrogant dilettante who gets by on a handsome face and a famous name. He thinks she’s a priggish bluestocking and insufferable do-gooder. Neither knows it yet, but over the next twenty years, they will form a historic partnership that will carry them both to the White House.Frances is destined to rise in a political world dominated by men, facing down the Great Depression as FDR’s most trusted lieutenant—even as she struggles to balance the demands of a public career with marriage and motherhood. And when vicious political attacks mount and personal tragedies threaten to derail her ambitions, she must decide what she’s willing to do—and what she’s willing to sacrifice—to save a nation.","**Many thanks to Berkley and Stephanie Dray for an ARC of this book provided via NetGalley!**""Being a woman has only bothered me in climbing trees."" - Frances PerkinsIt is this frank and fearless nature that sets Frances Perkins apart...and from the moment she arrives in New York City, destined to bring about change, she truly has her work cut out for her. Working with some of the poorest in Hell's Kitchen's tenements, it is apparent that working conditions (and living conditions) are not sustainable for the people of her fair city. She has several compatriots, each with a fire for revolution in their bellies: there's Upton Sinclair, a cheeky young fire-haired writer who longs to be more than just friends with Frances, a wealthy but kind socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, and a brooding, sensitive young reformer Paul Wilson, each determined to change the landscape in their own way. But after witnessing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire firsthand (with workers literally LEAPING out of the burning building to the ground below), Frances knows that labor conditions need change: immediate and DRASTIC change. Though she isn't directly involved in politics herself, Frances gets word that Franklin ""Feather Duster"" Roosevelt, a rich and haughty man she encountered at a party once (who wasn't exactly her number one fan, to put it mildly!) is running for office...and he might actually WIN. Roosevelt has a plan that will take him up through the ranks, and quickly: a plan that will end with him in the White House. When all of this comes to pass, NO one is more surprised than Frances when FDR not only recognizes Frances' passion for reform and labor policy, but wants to appoint her to be his Secretary of Labor...making her the very FIRST woman in the presidential cabinet.Although Frances is honored and perhaps more passionate and driven by her work than anyone around her, she is met with push-back and criticism over and over again. Many men assume she can't do her job AND be a wife and mother...but Frances isn't going to let anything stand in her way. But balancing the severe troubles experienced by members of her family...acting as an indomitable force during FDR's tenure...AND fighting for social security and labor reform proves to be nearly overwhelming for Frances, and she starts to wonder if she can TRULY make all of these dreams come true. Will her bold determination start a blaze of glory that will continue on for generations to come...or will everything she has worked for crumble before her very eyes?I'm a bit ashamed to say that before picking up this book, I probably hadn't heard the name Frances Perkins since elementary school...and since this may have been back in the 2nd or 3rd grade I couldn't have told you a THING about her. After reading this book, it's not only shocking but saddening to me that such an integral part of history was not a MAJOR focus in the curriculum. As someone who is very passionate when it comes to workers' rights (and as a former Union member myself, when I had the opportunity to be in one!) it was easy for me to become VERY invested in Frances' mission as she fought to keep children out of factories, to enforce more limited working hours (No more fourteen hour days...and we think we have it bad now! ) and to establish programs like social security which would benefit ALL citizens, not just those born into wealth. Sadly, many of these fights persist today, but they would have been Dead on Arrival PERMANENTLY if not for the tireless work of Frances Perkins. To say this book is enlightening is an understatement: I feel I owe Frances a debt of gratitude!Dray also does something special with this narrative: this is technically historical fiction, but almost reads more like a diary or a memoir. Perkins takes you through so many years of her life, but the chapters are fairly short and manageable, and there is a solid balance between Perkins' work life and her personal life. There is romance and heartache, inner turmoil and also an exploration of the power of friendship. While Perkins and FDR have a rocky start, the two learn to work in tandem in a truly powerful way, and like all of the relationships explored here, has a complexity and a beauty all its own. Perkins' choices are never easy, and this is the recurring theme underlying her entire career. Being a woman during this time was hard enough in and of itself, but to make some of the 'radical' statements and decisions Perkins was forced to make at times was what set her apart...and I am SO thrilled Dray chose to share this history in such an interesting way.This book is also 500+ pages (!) which is usually somewhat of a red flag for me when it comes to historical fiction, but this one is written in such a way that it never feels overly long or complex. The chapters move along at a pretty good clip, and as a reader I felt that the only reason the book was this length was to make sure she captured as much detail about Perkins' life as possible: this one is meticulously researched, with Dray highlighting at the end any areas where she took creative liberty, but these are few and far between. There's always a stark difference between authors who TRULY do their research in historical fiction and those that rely on more 'basic' tropes and commonly known information. I applaud Dray's dedication to preserving the integrity of Frances Perkins and EVERYTHING she accomplished during her truly impactful time in office.And through Dray, by the end of her journey, Perkins makes an observation true of so many bold and brilliant, brave and breathtaking revolutionaries of the past, present, and future: ""So maybe a spark of madness is what it takes to accomplish anything truly revolutionary in this world.""One tiny, seemingly insignificant, but POWERFUL spark! 🔥 💪4 stars",4.0
205,The Housemaid's Secret,Thriller,"As he continues showing me their incredible penthouse apartment, I have a terrible feeling about the woman behind closed doors. But I can't risk losing this job – not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It's hard to find an employer who doesn't ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything...That's when I make a promise. After all, I've done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

”in every universe, it’s you for me. even if it’s not me for you.”

— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift. can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life! did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called “happy place” i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make you happy. the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm! — this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between a past and present timeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.

”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”

 — second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.— PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending. ↳ harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace, the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough* i also hate my job. her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.↳ wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters. ↳ 
wyn and harriet:
— i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. — i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹

“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”

↳ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was that friendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>> — overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!! — but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happy happy place release day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.",4.0
207,The Inmate,Thriller,"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates. But none of the staff at the prison knows Brooke has already broken the rules. Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary's most notorious and dangerous inmates. And they certainly don't know that Shane was Brooke's high school sweetheart―the star quarterback who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of grisly murders. Or that Brooke's testimony was what put him there. But Shane knows. And he will never forget.","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0
208,Lessons in Chemistry,Fiction,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD WINNER • Meet Elizabeth Zott: a “formidable, unapologetic and inspiring” (PARADE) scientist in 1960s California whose career takes a detour when she becomes the unlikely star of a beloved TV cooking show in this novel that is “irresistible, satisfying and full of fuel” (The New York Times Book Review) and “witty, sometimes hilarious . . . the Catch-22 of early feminism.” (Stephen King, via Twitter)A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, Oprah Daily, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek“The most delightful novel I read this year . . . fresh and surprising . . . I laughed out loud!” —Philip Galanes, The New York Times“A unique heroine . . . you’ll find yourself wishing she wasn’t fictional.” —Seattle TimesChemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results. But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo. Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.","(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)[plot spoilers]I had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.So this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.This all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!So this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!But there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.I'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.P.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!",2.0
209,The Midnight Library,Fiction,"Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0

You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's not that bad!!"" i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want to look at this, let alone read it.here's what i liked:this scene - ""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously be SPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."" ). No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.",1.0

Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F.

Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media.

Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do. yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn't work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way. my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc. this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way. so many mouthpieces. i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing as framing and context which are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie, when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary. despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrative is juniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was, ‘…that’s it?’ i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says, ‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’ Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface. it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere. oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:  ""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""  but what happens after? we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we've seen the cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that it teases you with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assault edit 24/05/2023:  unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1) i am not white. i am asian,  2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired. in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about. 'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.' go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry. and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.",2.0
212,Remarkably Bright Creatures,Fiction,"After Tova Sullivan's husband died, she began working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium, mopping floors and tidying up. Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she's been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago.Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn't dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors--until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova.Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova's son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it's too late.Shelby Van Pelt's debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt impossible.","This might be my favorite book this year, and will also be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Why did I love it so much? Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style. Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus? The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.",5.0
213,One by One,Thriller,"One by one, they will get what they deserve...A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.Then Claire’s minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren’t as easy to navigate as they thought.Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost. And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear:Only one of them will return home alive.","I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",3.0

The series adaptation on Prime Video just released and it’s so far freaking good, especially the songs ! And here’s my review for this legendary novel of TJR! Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a captivating and emotional story that explores the rise and fall of a fictional 1970s rock band named The Six, as told through the eyes of their lead singer, Daisy Jones.The novel is written in an unconventional format, presented as a transcript of interviews with the band members, their friends, and family, as well as other individuals who were involved in the band's journey. This format is not only unique but also adds a sense of realism to the story, making the reader feel as though they are reading a true account of a band's rise to fame. The characters in Daisy and the Six are incredibly well-developed, with each member of the band having their own distinct personality and backstory. Daisy, in particular, is a compelling character, with her raw talent and rebellious spirit causing both admiration and friction among her bandmates. The novel's portrayal of the music industry in the 1970s is also fascinating, with the reader getting a glimpse into the excess and indulgence that came with fame during that era. The book's exploration of the band's creative process is also intriguing, as it delves into the complexities of writing and performing music.One of the strengths of Daisy and the Six is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader. The highs and lows of the band's journey are felt keenly, and the relationships between the characters are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.What makes Daisy and the Six such a compelling read is the way that Taylor Jenkins Reid captures the spirit of the 1970s music scene. The story is set against a backdrop of social and cultural change, and the author weaves these themes seamlessly into the narrative.The book is a love letter to rock and roll, and Jenkins Reid's passion for music shines through in every chapter. She expertly captures the excitement and energy of live performances, and the way that music can bring people together.But beyond the music, Daisy and the Six is also a deeply human story about love, loss, and the bonds that connect us. The relationships between the band members are complex and multifaceted, and the novel delves into the various conflicts and tensions that arise as a result.What's more, the book is also a commentary on the nature of fame and the toll that it can take on those who achieve it. The Six are catapulted to stardom almost overnight, and the pressure to maintain their success takes a heavy toll on the band members' personal lives.In conclusion, Daisy and the Six is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that will stay with readers long after they finish it. It's a must-read for anyone who loves music, drama, and unforgettable characters, and it's a testament to the enduring power of rock and roll.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
215,Listen for the Lie,Mystery,"Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast ""Listen for the Lie,"" and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
216,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot.

Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

I didn’t like the book, the main character was extremely unlikeable and I kept rolling my eyes when reading what she thought and did.

And they won’t rest until they find a way to keep him from killing again.The haunt is on.","Another ghost story where I had to lay my skepticism to rest. I might even start to look for books with a supernatural angle.This was a superb thriller. Three girls being killed by the same man, haunted by it and wanting revenge.

221,To Kill a Mockingbird,Classics,"The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.","/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.",1.0
222,The Great Gatsby,Classics,"Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted ""gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,"" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.(from the back cover)","Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life”, focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. 

Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¹ - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¹ I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.
Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
“voice is full of money”
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.

The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
“an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again”
.

This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? 

Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose voices are “full of money”, who are “gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor”, people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”



This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me now, almost a full century since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you.

223,Animal Farm,Classics,"Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.","سيظل دائما جميع الحيوانات سواسية..الا ان بعض ""الخنازير"" ستري دائما انها ""متساوية"" اكثر من الاخرينجورج اورويل عام 1943 يقدم لنا نموذج لثورةثورة حيوانات علي ""صاحب العزبة""..عشان حقوقهمثورة زي اي ثورة في تاريخ الانسانية..ثورة زي الثورة الروسية ولا الرومانية ولا ....أهي ثورةحكاية مكررة، تقريبا بنفس النهاية..فإننا لم نتعلم من التاريخ، فهل سنتعلم من الرمز؟الحكاية هنا حكاية ثورةثورة ما من اجل عيش يتناسب مع العمل..من اجل حرية حقيقيةثورة ما من اجل الكرامة..ثورة من اجل العدالة الاجتماعيةثورة نجحت في ازالة الضاغية...ثورة نجحت في جعل الارض كلها حقا للثوارصارت ارضهم وملكهم..صار خيرها كله لهم..صاروا يملكون زمام امورهمصاروا يتغنون نشيد نصرهم...فرحين بحريتهم..يرون في المستقبل فقط رخائهمآل التنظيم الي جماعه من الخنازير..يقودها اثنانالاول اختار مصلحة باقي الحيوانات واراد تطوير حياتهم بما يحقق اهداف ثورتهموالثاني اختار الكسل..اختار التراخياختار ان يطلق علي الاول كلابه ليتلاشيواختار ان ينفيه ويعلنه خائنا للبلاد..لاختلاف سياسة الاصلاح التي يريدها الاول بسياستهشوه سمعته ومحا بطولته..بإستخدام خنزير اعلامي ""يقلب الحق باطلا"" ايضا يعمل تحت سياستهاختار ان يغير الدستور الوصايا السبع..بما يحقق مصالحه وسياستهوصار الثاني هو الحاكم الرسمي للبلاد..الحاكم الشرعي..الوحيد ..الجمهوري المنتخب..بما لا يتعارض مع سياستهصار الاول خائن...واي من يظهر عليه علامه تمرد فإنه خائن مثله ويعدم فورا..لا يتعارض هذا مع القانون..فقد غطي عليه بسياستهعاد الظلم..عاد القهر..عاد الفقر وقله العيشعاد التمييز الاجتماعيوكيف له الا يعود وهناك قطيع من الخرفان الاغنام يمأمأون بانجازات الخنازير الواهية..الكاذبةيرددون الافكار المحرفه..يعلون بها صوتهم فوق اي صوت للمعارضهستتأثر بحق بمشهد اجتماع الناس بعد بضع شهور..يتذكرون ما كان ..ويقارونه بالانكيف ضاعت ثورتهم...كيف ضاع حلمهم..وكيف خفت صوت نشيدهميحاولوا التغني بنشيدهم مره اخري ...لربما بعث لهم الامل مجدداليفاجأوا بمنع الخنازير للنشيد..فالثوره انتهت بالنسبه للخنازير بحكمهم..وباعدامهم اخوانهم..المعارضون الخونه*************************ركب الخنازير الثورة وحموا حكمهم بالكلاب الشرسةوغطوا علي اخفاقاتهم وسرقاتهم بخنزيرهم المحنك اعلاميا يحيل الحق باطلا والباطل حقاتعاونوا مع الغراب الذي يدفع بغطاء ديني سماوي الحيوانات دفعا لتقبل معيشتهم الضنكهثم تحالفوا مع عدوهم الاصلي ليحكموا قبضتهم علي الحكموضعوا يدهم في يد الاعداء...حتي صار لافرق بين خنزيرا وانسان************************************لا اعتقد ان هذا ريفيو اساسا لروايه رائعه صاغها برمزيه وبراعه جورج اورويلهذا مجرد تلخيص ردئلقد عرفت الان لماذا لم تكتب احد اصدقائي هنا في الجودريدز ريفيو عن ذلك الروايه -بالرغم من غزاره ريفيوهاتها-..الروايه لا تستحق ريفيو اساساهي تقرأ وتستوعب فحسبولكن لنصارح أنفسنا ... أننا لم نتعظ من التاريخ بشكل مباشر...فكيف ان نتعظ من صورة رمزية له وإن كانت بمنتهي الأتقانفلنحاولربما ننجح يوما في ثورة لا تنتهي بمزرعة الحيواناتمحمد العربيفقط في 24 يونيو 2013""ملحوظه""-----قرأت تلك الرواية قبل احداث 30 يونيو 2013والغريب جدا ان بعد أعادة قراءتي للريفيو أجد أنها تصلح لنفس الحال بعد سنتين..نفس الريفيو الرمزي يصلح لأي وقت...بالضبط كالرواية..وسعدت أني كتبت الريفيو بالرمز مثلهاالعجيب فعلا ان الرواية تصلح لكل العهود السياسية التي أتت علينامصر قبل 25 يناير وبعدهامصر قبل 30 يونيو وبعدهاوبمجرد ان قرئتها..شعرت ان هذه الرواية يجب ان يتم تدريسها بالمدارس..فكل الاجيال تستحق هذا الوعي السياسيالا اني رايت سببا -وان اكاد ان اجزم انه ليس السبب الرئيسي لهذا- ان نهايتها المقبضه لا تتناسب لصغار السنولكن هذه النهاية المقبضة للاسف...واقعية",5.0

225,The Catcher in the Rye,Classics,"..Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.The Catcher in the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.
J.D. Salinger's
 (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","journal entrytoday i am 15 years old. everything is all bullshit, as usual. i can't believe how fucked everything is around me. like i'm surrounded by zombies. i can't talk to any of my so-called friends, i can't talk to jamie, i can't talk to my parents. who would bother listening anyway. i cannot wait to leave orange county! this place makes me fucking sick. everyone is a hypocrite. everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless. FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?",5.0
226,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
227,The Handmaid’s Tale,Fiction,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now…Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.","06/24/22These are dark times…..‘I just don’t like her.’ ‘I heard she has a lot of emails.’ ‘But I really love Bernie! If I can’t have Bernie, I’m not voting for HER… I’m going to vote my conscience!’ Elections matter. This draconian decision overturning Roe endangers every woman of child baring age, and it’s just the beginning. This decision is not about life, it’s about controlling women. As racist as this country is, it’s much more misogynistic. Don’t believe me? Barack Obama.By not voting for Hillary Clinton, whatever your reasoning, you (each of you) put lives of these women in danger. You are responsible for their deaths. It’s that straight forward. But, I understand you were misled. This does not have to stand! You have all the power and can redeem yourselves! You HAVE to vote Democratic up and down the ballot in the midterms this fall, and in every election going forward. Just two more Democratic senators is all that is needed to kill the filibuster and codify Roe into federal law.The first thing that must be done in 2023, after the Democrats control the house and the senate (because, this time you listened to me) … is to expand the court. Also, impeach those idiots that were put in by a criminal president.Pregnancy is dangerous. Women die from pregnancy. This is a healthcare issue.Vote. Vote blue. Every time. You know better, now do better.05/03/22Well, well, well….A heartfelt ‘fuck you’ to everyone who said I was over reacting in November 2016. Expand the court!Kill the filibuster!VOTE BLUE!09/01/21RE: Texas (AKA Gilead)Told you so…so many times. I could go on, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Rich, white, women will ALWAYS be able to get abortions BTW. It’s about women’s bodily sovereignty and about the men who are salivating at the thought of controlling us. Now let’s air lift EVERYTHING with a vagina out of Texas.I don’t see a difference between Republicans and the Taliban; Do you?#KillTheFilibuster #ExpandTheCourt 02/13/21Today 43 Republicans, traitors to their country, worried about losing their jobs decided against growing a pair. Portman in Ohio who isn't running for re-election is the portrait of cowardice. He could have voted guilty, but he didn't. Moscow Mitch voted 'not guilty' then immediately turned around to make a speech about how guilty Donald is for inciting the insurrection! You can't have it both ways, Mitch! Why did he vote 'not guilty?' Because of process... one can't hold a trial for a president for his crimes after he's out of office for crimes he committed while in office (yet, a president can't be held responsible for his crimes whilst in office)... But, between January 6th and the 20th, Mitch shut down the senate and refused to call the senate back to hold the trail, when according to him, would have been the appropriate time to hold the trial. All of which is entirely bullshit. Donald was impeached while he was still in office so it was entirely appropriate (required, actually) to put him on trial after he left office. My head hurts.Someone please stuff lettuce in Mitch's mouth and turn him on his shell.01/06/21Sadly, it’s time for an update. In this book, Gilead took control of the United States government via a violent coup in which they kill all the members of congress at the capitol. Then martial law was enacted. Carry on.5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about ‘life’ it’s about controlling women. If you can’t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to ‘in cases of rape and incest’ is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you’re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can’t afford more, it doesn’t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don’t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women? My stars and garters!03/31/17. So, this Russia thing.... Am I right?2/5/17.....just another giant step towards making this book a reality, like they always dreamed of.Original review written in 2o12:WARNING: This review is being written after I worked a 13 hour day, with another one on the horizon tomorrow, and a glass of wine and while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Current events have put this book on the forefront of my mind, and damn it I got to get this out. I have never written a review on The Handmaid's Tale because I love the book, and it is so hard to write about a book you love. Ehh, what the hell.OfFred was a normal everyday woman with a career, a name, a life like all women have come to expect and take for granted in this age. When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don’t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So………I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise………..icky poor women. Now it’s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I’m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I’m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote……unless that’s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It’s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don’t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it’s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said… Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I’m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I’m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to…..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the ‘other’. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don’t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio….sigh) any more than a conservative want’s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who’s right or wrong here, I’ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half…HALF… the country didn’t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don’t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) “The advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.”-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump…..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is “a goodly amount of both”, but in this election sexism won and women lost.",5.0
228,The Alchemist,Fiction,"Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
229,Pride and Prejudice,Fiction,"Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work ""her own darling child"" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268","➸ 4 stars 

“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.”

— pride and prejudice by jane austen stands as a pinnacle of english literature, enchanting readers for over two centuries with its timeless tale of love, societal expectations, and personal growth. set in the genteel world of regency-era england, the story follows the spirited elizabeth bennet as she navigates the complexities of courtship, marriage, and social hierarchy. central to the story is elizabeth’s tempestuous relationship with the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, whose initial aloofness belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually wins elizabeth’s heart.one of my resolutions this year was to step out of my comfort zone and explore classic literature, and since i absolutely adore pride and prejudice (2005), i decided to start with this book. after reading this story, i can now comprehend why “pride and prejudice” has captured the hearts of so many over the years with its wit, social insight and timeless romance makes it a captivating read. i’m not sure why it wasn’t a 5 star read for me, but i think that the slow start made it a bit challenging, it was until volume three where i started to really enjoy the story.➷ austen’s language was, at first, bit of a challenge. while her prose is beautiful and rich, sometimes i would have to go back to reread a chapter to understand what was happening. but that’s just a me issue since i’m not really used to reading classics and i had to keep reminding myself this book was written over 200 years ago. but as the story progresses you can see how the writing is eloquently beautiful. watching the 2005 movie so many times definitely helped me understand everything better. 

“a lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”

➳ elizabeth bennett:elizabeth is such a strong fmc. she takes no nonsense from anyone and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. what makes elizabeth captivating is her unwavering sense of integrity and her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of pressure from her family and society. she is not willing to settle for a loveless marriage or a life of luxury if it means sacrificing her own happiness and autonomy. throughout the story, elizabeth faces numerous challenges and obstacles, from her family’s financial struggles to the pressures of societal expectations. yet, she navigates these difficulties with grace and resilience, never compromising her principles or sacrificing her sense of self. she had a tendency to be judgemental throughout the book. she quickly forms opinions about people based on limited information or first impressions. for example, she initially perceives mr. darcy as proud and arrogant, partly influenced by negative rumours that mr. wickham told her. but as the story goes on, she learns that maybe she shouldn’t be so quick to judge. — i absolutely adored her relationship with her sister, jane. they both share a special sisterly bond that is central to the story. throughout the book, they confide in each other, offer advice, and provide emotional comfort during times of joy and distress. their tight-knit bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, providing unwavering support and understanding. together, they navigate the complexities of society and matters of the heart, offering each other comfort and guidance along the way.➳ fitzwilliam darcy:「 ”dearest and loveliest elizabeth” 」opposite elizabeth bennet stands the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, a wealthy and reserved gentleman hailing from a noble lineage. initially shrouded in arrogance and reserve, darcy’s facade belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually unfolds throughout the narrative. at the beginning of the story, he is seen as arrogant and dismissive, particularly in his interactions with the bennet family. his reluctance to engage in social situations and his propensity to make quick judgments about others contribute to his unfavorable reputation. while undeniably flawed, darcy’s journey is marked by a profound transformation—one of the most compelling arcs in the story. despite his pride and acute awareness of social status, darcy emerges as a fundamentally good man, grappling with his own prejudices and ultimately learning to open his heart to love. through his struggles and growth, darcy embodies the novel’s central themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the transformative power of genuine connection.꒰ mr. darcy + elizabeth: ꒱they are the true heart of this story. the romance between mr. darcy and elizabeth bennet is a slow-burn journey that unfolds gradually throughout this book. at the outset, elizabeth is put off by darcy’s perceived arrogance and social status, while darcy is equally dismissive of elizabeth’s lower social standing and outspokenness. darcy’s letter to lizzy is a pivotal moment that shifts the dynamics of their relationship. it’s a sincere attempt by darcy to address the misunderstandings between them and explain his actions. through the letter, darcy opens up about his past and motivations, revealing a more complex and vulnerable side of himself. for lizzy, it’s a moment of reckoning, as she grapples with the new insights into darcy’s character and her own feelings towards him.darcy: i love you even though you’re poor, your family have no etiquette and they suck, but idc will you marry me?? lizzy: no like this will never not be funny!! she left that man flabbergasted, like what did he expect her to say after just insulting her and her family 😭

”in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.”

— overall, this book remains a timeless classic, cherished for it’s witty dialogue, memorable characters and enduring themes. it’s not just a romance but also a sharp critique of societal norms and expectations. through the journey of characters like elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy, jane austen offers timeless lessons about prejudice, self-discovery, personal growth and the power of love. it’s a book that is still adored and continues to resonate with readers generations later. ───♡─────────────in my classics era",4.0

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols.

Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
231,The Kite Runner,Fiction,"1970s Afghanistan: Twelve-year-old Amir is desperate to win the local kite-fighting tournament and his loyal friend Hassan promises to help him. But neither of the boys can foresee what would happen to Hassan that afternoon, an event that is to shatter their lives. After the Russians invade and the family is forced to flee to America, Amir realises that one day he must return to an Afghanistan under Taliban rule to find the one thing that his new world cannot grant him: redemption.","Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.",1.0

Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”","Kids are evil. Don't you know?I've just finished rereading this book for my book club but, to be honest, I've liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school. Overall, Lord of the Flies doesn't seem to be very popular, but I've always liked the almost Hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures. Make the characters all angel-faced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have? Just your average high school drama, but set on a desert island. With a bit more bloody murder. But not that much more.In 1954, when this book was published, Britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand - that it is not, in fact, the centre of the universe, and the British Empire was not a thing of national pride, but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings. Much of British colonialism had been justified as a self-righteous mission to educate and modernise foreign ""savages"". So when put into its historical context, alongside the decolonisation movements, this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white, Western supremacy. Of course, to a modern reader there's a lot of racism in this book. The racial aspect is a big factor. Golding establishes from the very first page that Ralph is a perfect white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, private school boy. And Piggy even asks ""Which is better - to be a pack of painted n*****s like you are or to be sensible like Ralph is?"" I'm not going to argue with anyone's interpretation, but I think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism. For me, I always saw it as Golding challenging the notion of savages being dark-skinned, uneducated people from rural areas. With this book, he says screw that, I'll show you savages! and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and gold-plated upbringing.I think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says 
""I should have thought that a pack of British boys - you're all British, aren't you? - would have been able to put up a better show than that.""
 Golding's way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it.Some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book, but I don't think that's true. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel - namely, the failure of democracy and the pro-authority stance - but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach. Plus, anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination. The fascinating thing about Lord of the Flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries. You could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative Jack Merridew as a kind of Hitler (or other dictator) who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest. Dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos... we do not have to assume that Golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil, only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations.Still a fascinating book after all these years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0
234,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Fantasy,"Harry Potter, along with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry can't wait to get back to school after the summer holidays. (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, and the sinister prison guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school...","I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0

In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",5.0
236,The Alchemist,Fiction,"Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
237,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Self Help,"When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","This book explains 7 principles that make a person more effective personally and professionally. Covey shows how a principle-centered, character-based life helps you build the healthy relationships that are key to an effective life. This classic is well worth reading for its perspective and practical advice.ConceptsCorrect Principles: Covey frequently references his Christianity. He says the Habits are based on ""Correct Principles"" (aka Natural Law) found in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and common to major religions.P/PC Balance: Covey says you must maintain a balance between production (P; your output) and production capability (PC; your ability to produce). You must stay healthy and renew yourself (see Habit 7) or you'll get burned out and become ineffective. He uses the fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg as a metaphor.Interdependence: Covey says the Habits lead you from dependence to independence to interdependence (cooperating with others to achieve a common goal; producing things greater than the sum of their parts).The 7 HabitsHabit 1: Be ProactiveYou choose how to respond to what life throws at you. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom to choose. Take responsibility for your actions.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind Choose your short-term, daily behavior according to the plan you have for your entire life. Think about the legacy you want to leave. Put things in perspective; what would you want people to say at your funeral?Habit 3: Put First Things FirstDaily planning is too narrow and short-sighted. Weekly planning gives a better big-picture perspective of your goals, and allows for the flexibility to deal with the things that will inevitably come up.People are more important than things, so plan your time accordingly. Be efficient with things, but effective with people. You can't be efficient with relationships; they take time. Instead of focusing on things and time, focus on relationships and results.Only spend time on things that align with your deep values. Don't waste time on other things, even if it means saying no to requests. Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.Think of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Focus on the important, even though they seem less urgent. Think preventatively to keep tasks from ever becoming urgent.Use stewardship delegation instead of ""gofer"" delegation; teach a person to be the steward of the task you assign to them, rather than constantly telling them to ""go for this"" or ""go for that.""Habit 4: Think Win/WinMost of life requires cooperation, not competition. Work together with co-workers, friends, and family for mutual benefit. Approach everything in terms of ""win/win or no deal""; if you can't reach a deal in which both parties feel they're winning, don't make a deal at all. Create win/win agreements that clearly state expectations, privileges, consequences up front. This prevents you from having to figure those things out when issues arise, and makes the relationship more smooth because it causes each person to manage themselves.Think in terms of the Abundance Mentality rather than the Scarcity Mentality; the quest for recognition, credit, power, and profit isn't a zero-sum game. Be happy when others succeed.Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be UnderstoodListen with the intent to understand, not to reply. Diagnose before you prescribe. Understand needs, concerns, situation before you give advice.To understand others, listen with empathy. To be understood, present your views according to:• ethos: personal credibility• pathos: emotional alignment with the other person• logos: logical reasoningYou can't motivate people by appealing to satisfied needs (money, status, etc.); only unsatisfied needs motivate.Habit 6: Synergize.Value the differences in relationships. Oneness is not sameness, it's complementariness. Unity is not uniformity.Habit 7: Sharpen the SawRenew and improve in yourself in the following categories, by spending at least an hour on each category daily.• Physical: Eat right and exercise.• Spiritual: Find and carry an inner peace. Meditate, read Scripture, or spend time in nature.• Mental: Read good literature to gain the insights of others. Write, organize, and plan.• Social/emotional: Understand others. Serve others, at work or through volunteering.AfterwardCovey says a summary of the first 3 Habits is ""make and keep a promise,"" and a summary of the next 3 Habits is ""involve others in the problem and work out the solution together."" He says the first 3 Habits are about integrity, and the next 3 are about loyalty.",4.0
238,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Nonfiction,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.",3.0

240,How to Win Friends and Influence People,Self Help,"You can go after the job you want...and get it! You can take the job you have...and improve it! You can take any situation you're in...and make it work for you!Since its release in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People has sold more than 30 million copies. Dale Carnegie's first book is a timeless bestseller, packed with rock-solid advice that has carried thousands of now famous people up the ladder of success in their business and personal lives.As relevant as ever before, Dale Carnegie's principles endure, and will help you achieve your maximum potential in the complex and competitive modern age.Learn the six ways to make people like you, the twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking, and the nine ways to change people without arousing resentment.","This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review.",2.0
242,Think and Grow Rich,Business,"Think and Grow Rich is a guide to success by Napoleon Hill, which was first published in 1937 following the Great Depression. It was immediately welcomed as an antidote to hard times and remained a bestseller for decades. Many people still find its philosophy of positive thinking and its specific steps for achieving wealth both relevant and life-changing. Hill contends that our thoughts become our reality, and offers a plan and principles for transforming thoughts into riches, including visualization, affirmation, creating a Master Mind group, defining a goal, and planning.","Let's be honest to ourselves and face the truth: success in business depends on a complex equation with a lot of variants, such as 1) how well your business idea adapts to the powers of supply and demand, which govern (and oppress) contemporary society, 2) where you come from economically to begin with (I've seen aromatherapy businesses run by middle-class sons of bitches grow and be more ""successful"" than neighborhood food establishments run by poor honest people), 3) how much investing capital you have at the time of creating your business, 4) your race, and 5) sheer dumb luck. Quotes like “The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat” are ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous and delve into the worst kind of new-agey, self-help bullshitting bullying: victim-blaming. So, if your business is not successful, you are to blame, because you simply failed to desire it enough? Fuck that shit. This book is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in today's first-world-white-heterosexual-male-dominated economic culture. Tell me that such ideas as ""desiring it enough"" would work in Somalia, hell, even in Egypt, and then we'll talk. Don't waste your time with this codswallop. Read real literature instead: you'll definitely increase your IQ this way.",1.0
243,The Secret,Self Help,"The worldwide bestselling phenomenon that has helped millions tap the power of the law that governs all our lives to create—intentionally and effortlessly—a joyful life.In 2006, a groundbreaking feature-length film revealed the great mystery of the universe—The Secret—and, later that year, Rhonda Byrne followed with a book that became a worldwide bestseller.Fragments of a Great Secret have been found in the oral traditions, in literature, in religions, and philosophies throughout the centuries. For the first time, all the pieces of The Secret come together in an incredible revelation that will be life-transforming for all who experience it.In this book, you’ll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life—money, health, relationships, happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world. You’ll begin to understand the hidden, untapped power that’s within you, and this revelation can bring joy to every aspect of your life.The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers—men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth, and happiness. By applying the knowledge of The Secret, they bring to light compelling stories of eradicating disease, acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible.","this website is too kind. one star means ""didn't like it"". I hate, hate, hate this book with absolute passion. sorry if you like oprah but she seriously did the world a disservice by recommending this book. apparently there is a dvd also that i don't even think i could stomach. so here's the concept behind ""The Secret"". You can attract good things to you through your good thoughts. Ok, I'm on board with that. It has worked for me. Ooh, I already knew the Secret! too bad I didn't use it to make millions like this chick! But no, it goes further. You attract bad things to you through your negative thoughts. Well, negative thoughts are pretty useless, so I can see benefit in trying to decrease or eliminate them. And one time (true story) I did get robbed while traveling after worrying about it for 3 weeks. BUT. There is no gray area with this one. According to the author, people who are raped, killed, maimed, tortured - they all bring it on themselves with their negative thoughts. The people in Darfur should be thinking ""here comes the food, there go the guns"". The book goes on to say that weight management is simply a matter of ""thinking thin"" and not looking at fat people (for real), that if you have a stack of bills to pay you should instead picture checks coming in, that you can have everything you want through visualization, such as your hands on the steering wheel of your car, and that you can cure your cancer watching funny movies. There is a weak chapter at the end about how you can use your Secret powers for the common good, like world peace, but why would you want to waste it when you can be driving your new Hummer? I would go so far as to say that this book is not only BAD but it is DANGEROUS. It promotes the self-absorbed, materialistic, shallow outlook of predominantly rich white people to the exclusion of the rest of the planet - while managing to blame them for their problems and justify those in possession of the Secret for not using their visualized wealth to promote social change. Aah, brilliant. genius. avoid this book. do not give money to this woman and her brilliant marketing pyramid!",1.0
244,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",Business,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his ""rich dad"" — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.","I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting ""This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!"" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book. Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages: * When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses. * Try to own things that put money in your pocket. * If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money. There you go. That's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics. Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she hasn't been ""discovered"" yet. He tells her to take courses in marketing, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to market them. I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I'd feel for responding to a ""get rich quick"" spam mail.",1.0
245,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,Self Help,"But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him ""The Fittest (Real) Man in America.""In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.","I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, it's an inspiring story of a man who has overcome a lifetime of struggle and proved that you can do anything if you're willing to push yourself. In the first half of the book especially this was a message that resonated with me and made me think about David Goggins as a man to look up to. On the other hand, it's a cautionary tale of a man who is so stubborn he can not learn from his past mistakes. He is constantly going into situations underprepared and then pushing his body past the point of sanity in order to accomplish a goal and seemingly expecting applause for that. Were he in some life or death situation then I might just give him said applause, but instead, he is always just trying to prove something to himself which is a really unhealthy way to go through life. Overall there were two main lessons to take from Mr Goggins story. One is that if you really put your mind to a task you can achieve the impossible. The second is that there is nothing admirable about taking the path of highest resistance just for the sake of personal pride. Yes, Mr Goggins has achieved amazing things, but there are others who have achieved similar results in a more intelligent and healthy way. In the end, I came in exactly on the halfway mark in regards to how I felt about this book and I have rounded up for the sake of not wanting to give this book a 2-star review. One final note is a comment on the audiobook. Mr Goggins made the decision to insert multiple interludes that feature the narrator interviewing him. These were interesting at first but soon grew really tiresome. They felt really self-serving as each one went along the lines of the narrator expressing how in awe of David Goggins he was, and David Goggins expressing yet again how hard it was for him to achieve his goals. I could have done without 50% of these as well.",3.0
246,You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life,Self Help,"In this refreshingly entertaining how-to guide, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author and world-traveling success coach, Jen Sincero, serves up 27 bite-sized chapters full of hilariously inspiring stories, sage advice, easy exercises, and the occasional swear word. If you're ready to make some serious changes around here, You Are a Badass will help you: Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviors that stop you from getting what you want, blast past your fears so you can take big exciting risks, figure out how to make some damn money already, learn to love yourself and others, set big goals and reach them - it will basically show you how to create a life you totally love, and how to create it now.By the end of You Are a Badass, you'll understand why you are how you are, how to love what you can't change, how to change what you don't love, and how to use The Force to kick some serious ass.","Not good. I can sum up this book pretty quickly. If you want to make a change in your life, or if you are not happy with your life, you are the only one who can make it better. There were a few things that really bothered me. If you are depressed, you cannot simply decide that you are not going to be depressed anymore and get yourself out and have fun. It is apparent that the author has never experienced depression, or been a very sympathetic friend to anyone she knows who has been depressed. I also feel that some of her advice is not very practical in the real world. So if I'm a single mom supporting 4-5 kids, and I've always dreamed of starting my own business, I should just quit my job? I should buy expensive things, that I might not be able to pay for? There is some good advice on stopping negative thoughts, but some of the examples of going for what you really want are just not practical for most people.",1.0
247,The Last Lecture,Nonfiction,"A lot of professors give talks titled 'The Last Lecture'. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.","I sat down to write my review of “The Last Lecture” on Friday July 25th. Before I started to write, I decided to check Randy Pausch's website for any updates on his condition. He had died that morning at the age of 47. The book, and the lecture itself, now take on new meaning.For those who aren't aware, Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students. What would you say? What wisdom would you impart? What are your lessons in life? For Randy, this was not a hypothetical question. Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced “the elephant in the room”: advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months. With this revelation out of the way, he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others. The lecture was so full of optimism, clarity, hope, humour, and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book. “The Last Lecture” contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture, plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experience.Like the lecture, the book is earnest and straightforward. Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it. He fills his stories with humour, occasionally laugh out loud. What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind. It's hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author. He seems like a great guy, someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend. I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success; his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words. This still comes across in the book, although not as strongly as in the lecture. In fact, without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words, reading the book can almost get a bit tiring. I recall thinking on a number of occasions: “Ok, we know that you're a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up, you don't need to keep telling me”. Some of the advice in the book, especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture, can be a bit tough to swallow. For example, his advice to always carry 200$ in cash in your wallet; does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book? Similarly, he often speaks of the great mentors, friends, and supporters that he has had through his life; not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their student's careers. Finally, his advice to never give up (“Brick walls are not there to keep us out, they are there so we can show how much we want something”) sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement. He never says to expect something for nothing, but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it. Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge. Fortunately these moments are fairly rare, and as long as you don't read the book in a single sitting (which is quite possible) then you probably won't feel too overwhelmed.Interestingly, shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture. What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far? It is quite a difficult question to answer. I'm sure that I don't have the life experience to give a good enough answer, but it's quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response. I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book. We need people like Randy, who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it. Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice, what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in, and that he thought others would benefit from hearing. His life, lecture, book, and his death remind me of a quote from Dr. Howard Thurman: ""Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive”. Even as he lived the last few months of his life, I know that Randy was truly alive.",3.0
248,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Nonfiction,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail.",2.0

Now comes her highly anticipated first book featuring her signature combination of honesty, humor, and direct, no-nonsense advice.Each chapter of Girl, Wash Your Face begins with a specific lie Hollis once believed that left her feeling overwhelmed, unworthy, or ready to give up. As a working mother, a former foster parent, and a woman who has dealt with insecurities about her body and relationships, she speaks with the insight and kindness of a BFF, helping women unpack the limiting mind-sets that destroy their self-confidence and keep them from moving forward.From her temporary obsession with marrying Matt Damon to a daydream involving hypnotic iguanas to her son's request that she buy a necklace to ""be like the other moms,"" Hollis holds nothing back. With unflinching faith and tenacity, Hollis spurs other women to live with passion and hustle and to awaken their slumbering goals.","Some parts of this book spoke to me (yes, I can be better at showing up for myself), and others made me want to throw the book across the room and scream. I struggled with every word she said about diet and body image—what was meant to be uplifting and inspiring was preached as scientific fact from someone with no medical/dietetic credentials. She had nothing to back up her claims, but she preached it like doctrine. I also really struggled with the story of how she met her husband. She says that people may have issue with her sharing it and that it isn’t meant for it to be used to condone an unhealthy relationship. But....she married the man from her super unhealthy relationship. Guys, don’t marry the guy who “brings you to bars and ignores you while he hits on other women.” Don’t marry the guy who “only calls you at night when he’s been drinking but ignores you during the day.” Don’t marry the guy who you “give your virginity to because you don’t know how else to keep him interested.” I mean, really. She gave so much time to how terrible their first year was and then gives a quick “but now everything is great!” And it just doesn’t work for me.I think the point of the husband story was that when she told him she needed to be respected and she didn't want him calling anymore, he realized she was worth respecting. She had to respect herself to get respect, yada yada. Buuuutttt telling someone you don't want them to contact you anymore and then having them show up on your doorstep the next morning is literally the opposite of respect. I love it when I set boundaries and people totally ignore them—romance! Edit: I have to come back and discuss more things that are not okay. The diet pills? She essentially tells everyone that she and her roommate survived off of diet pills to the point that they were hallucinating, so they stopped taking them and gained back 40 lbs. She doesn’t discourage this, if anything the quick “oh and then we gained weight and became less attractive” seems like a subtle “I can’t recommend this BUT if you want to lose weight here’s how to do it.” Sooo not okay. Additionally, when people come to her her diet advice (why is she giving diet advice? Is she a dietician? Does she have any medical knowledge?) she tells them to start by drinking more water, and when they’ve mastered that start cutting out foods. Here’s an idea: listen to your body!! Thin =/= worthy/good/important.Another edit: I was on a plane with my young exhausted kids today and was thinking how an outsider would totally judge my parenting skills, but I gotta do what I gotta do and my in-flight parenting techniques are totally different from day-to-day. Then I remembered how Rachel went off on the totally exhausted mom for giving her kid candy on a plane. Maybe there was more to it that I’m not remembering? But honestly, anyone who has flown with their kids knows the struggle is real.",1.0

One Last Shot is the first book in the Alaska Air One Rescue series. It’s a clean romantic suspense.Saving lives in the last frontier is always a pull for me! The epic adventures and romance pulled me in and the beautiful story held my attention. By my criteria, I shouldn’t have liked this book:🤠 A male headshot cover🤠 A country music star🤠 A reality TV show backdropBut I did. THAT’S how good Susan May Warren is at writing suspense.

And the Kingston boys from Sky King Ranch!!!!I loved the opportunity to return to Copper Mountain, to meet the crew of Air One, and to read this inspiring book about trust, purpose, worth, judgment and forgiveness. My highlighter was going overtime with all the inspirational verses! I especially loved the lesson about sailboats vs rowboats and hearing about the inspiration for Boo and Oaken’s names.“You can blame God and go it alone. Or you can trust that God loves you and that he’ll carry you through the storm.”I purchased this ebook through the author’s website and got early access before publication!",5.0

Is Kira's dream of being a Magical Girl really possible...or is Catacorn not really what she promises to be?","Small bit of review: I quite enjoyed this one. I had BIG issues with Kira, really wanted to sling her into space several times she was just so rude, but in the later half things went better in regards to her and I started to, very slowly, like her more. I loved art. Tulip was great. Catacorn was an interesting character and I loved finding out more about her. The transformation and the outfits and the actions were all just SO awesome and I now want to watch some mahou shoujo anime (well, technically I am watching one, but I mean a more pure mahou shoujo, teehee). I loved how the graphic novel got better and better and I loved the ending. It was just so fab. Oh, and plus points for the colours and sparkles. Also the cover was a lot of fun.

For fans of the classic films Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven.Once, the war was fought with kindlings—elite, magic-wielding warriors whose devastating power comes at the cost of their own young lives.Now, the war is over, and kindlings have been cast adrift—their magic outlawed, their skills outdated, their formidable balar weapons prized only as relics and souvenirs.Violence still plagues the countryside, and memories haunt those who remain. When a village comes under threat of siege, it offers an opportunity for seven kindlings to fight one last time. But war changed these warriors. And to reclaim who they once were, they will have to battle their pasts, their trauma, and their grim fates to come together again—or none of them will make it out alive.From bestselling and award-winning author Traci Chee comes a gut-wrenching, introspective fantasy about seven lost soldiers searching for the peace they once fought for and the future in which they’re finally daring to believe.",This was hurtful. I highly recommend it (only if you have tissues near by),5.0
257,Leave No Trace,Mystery,"In a daring, brutal act of terrorism, an explosion rocks and topples the Statue of Liberty. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with that news and sent to New York as the agent-in-charge. Not long after he lands, he learns two things - one that Gina Delgado of the FBI has been placed in charge of the investigation as the lead of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and two, that threats of a second terrorism attack are already being called into the media. While barred from the meetings of the Joint Task Force for his lack of security clearance, Walker finds a young boy among the survivors with a critical piece of information - a video linking the attackers to the assault.As a radical domestic terrorist group, led by a shadowy figure known only as Jebediah, threatens further attacks against America's cultural symbols, powerful forces within the government are misleading the investigation to further their own radical agenda.","Leave No Trace
 by A. J. Landau (pseudonym for authors Jon Land and Jeff Ayers) starts with an explosion that topples the Statue of Liberty and maintains a relentless pace. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with the news and sent to New York as the agent-in-charge. However, upon arrival he quickly learns that Gina Delgado of the FBI will be overseeing the investigation. Due to Michael’s lack of a security clearance, he is barred from meetings of the Joint Task Force so he scours the grounds and finds a witness with key information on the attackers.Michael and Gina are likeable characters and readers get to see their points of view as well as that of a key supporting character and two antagonists. The multi-angled view of the characters allows readers to see how each character connects to the story; adding depth and complexity that is effective.The authors kept me rapidly turning the pages with gripping scenes, plenty of action and danger, a superb plot, and excellent writing. Along the way, readers also learn a bit about several national parks making this an educational as well as an exceptional thriller read. Despite the short chapters and switching scenes and characters, the flow worked well for me. A constant sense of urgency, a state of uneasiness, and lots of action combined with great characters and a well-written plot make this suspenseful novel a must read.Overall, this is a gritty, intense, and chilling story with complex characters. It’s intense and dramatic and kept this reader rapidly turning the pages. This is the first book in the National Parks Thriller series and I can’t wait for the next one. I recommend it to those who like political, action, and military thrillers. St. Martin’s Press and A. J.

It's an entertaining romp that feels like Indiana Jones meets magical fairytale, with friendship, romance, curses, evil witches, and twists.

Bruno works at the Lido Cabana Bar at the Punta Bandera Hotel, and his friend, Karl Drago, is getting married on the beach right outside. After the festivities, Bruno and Marie go skinny dipping in the ocean, but they’re quickly interrupted by a visit from law enforcement.A shooting has just occurred at El Gato Gordo nightclub, and the victim is a prominent local figure and Bruno’s close friend.

The move to Costa Rica was necessitated by the fact that he’s a wanted man in the US, and facing imprisonment. However, he’s given an ultimatum by the Costa Rican police that unless he helps them with an investigation into a shooting at the Gato Gordo nightclub, they’ll turn him in. Six people were shot dead at the club, including a very good friend of Bruno’s, so it’s in his own interest to discover who committed this terrible crime, and also why.In between working as a bartender at the Punta Bandera Hotel, investigating the shooting, and trying to maintain some sort of family life, Bruno is pulled every which way, and it doesn’t help that his boss (The Ice Maiden), keeps the staff under constant surveillance, resulting in threats to terminate their employment. She orders Bruno to remove a body, along with any evidence from a room in the hotel - and from there on in the action really kicks in!Another twisty, action packed storyline, full of evil characters, but with plenty of light relief in the form of Waldo, Bruno’s friend Drago’s huge Rottweiler dog, who plays a very large part in the story - this dog has a mind of his own, and he’s nobody’s fool! But it provides lots of laughs regarding Bruno’s relationship with the wonderful Waldo.

262,Still See You Everywhere,Thriller,"She has called herself ""death,"" but people called her the devil.The case was sensational. Kaylee Pierson had confessed from the very beginning, waived all appeals. Despite the media’s chronicling of her tragic circumstances—the childhood spent with a violent father—no one could find sympathy for “the Beautiful Butcher” who had led eighteen men home from bars before viciously slitting their throats. Now, with only twenty-one days left to live, Pierson has finally received a lead on the whereabouts of the sister who was kidnapped over a decade ago, and she needs Frankie’s help to find her. The Beautiful Butcher’s offer: When was the last time your search ended with finding the living? Unable to resist the chance for a rescue, Frankie takes on Pierson’s request. Twelve years ago, five-year-old Leilani went missing in Hawaii. The main suspect? Pierson’s tech mogul ex-boyfriend, Sanders MacManus. Now, on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific—the site of MacManus’s latest vanity project—fresh evidence has appeared. In order to learn the truth and possibly save a young woman’s life, Frankie must go undercover at the isolated base camp. Her challenge: A dozen strangers. Countless dangerous secrets. Zero means of calling for help. And then the storm rolls in…","Thank you Grand Central Pub for the ARC. Please don't blocklist me. IYKYK, my reviews are ALWAYS honest.  Writing: I refuse to believe this is THEE Lisa Gardner | Plot: gave me nothing | Ending: stop it. stop it right now  SYNOPSIS Frankie Elkin is sent to an atoll off the shores of Honolulu to track down a serial killer's missing sister.  MY OPINION Respectfully... NO. Absolutely NOT. I was SO excited to read this one because even though Lisa Gardner and I have our differences, she is a WRITERRRRR. Her prose is very distinct, she clearly does her research, and her plots are always juicy. Sometimes a lil too juicy for my liking, but definitely entertaining. But THIS??? THIS RIGHT HERE???? Have you ever shoved a handful of tortilla chips into your mouth only to realize they're stale af? That's how reading this felt. Even if Lisa Gardner showed me a recording of typing every single word of this book, I would scream DEEP FAKE and run away. Let me stay in denial because this cannot be THEE Lisa Gardner who wrote one of my all-time favourite books, Live to Tell. This is like Dervla McTiernan's The Murder Rule (if you've been following my reviews for awhile, you KNOW how I felt about that one).To no on'e surprise, I did not read the first two books in this series. BUT, after finishing this piece of work, I picked up book #1 to confirm my suspicions that this was whack af. Where were Gardner's signature sentence fragments??? All I got was basic ass writing that was trending Freida McFadden. Yes. THAT bad. And what happened to Gardner's suspenseful storytelling? After getting off to a great start, we're stalled out learning about forest patterns and birds and big ass crabs for a solid 30% of the book. Frankie, you've been brought to the atoll to find Lea, stop tryna hit on your boss. Save some rizz for the rest of us please.Also, Frankie makes it clear that she doesn't find missing people for money and I'm convinced that's not by choice. In fact, SHE should be paying her clients for letting her make a mess of everything. Frankie is about as discreet as a straight man's line of sight when a phat ass walks by. She's allegedly undercover so either 1) she doesn't understand what that really means or 2) there is no second option, it has to be the first. And Frankie's special skill being that she ""asks the right questions"" was absolutely hilarious. I wouldn't even trust Frankie to ask a six-year-old what they had for dinner. I really didn't want to do any spoilies because the release date is so far away, but like Frankie, I just can't stfu...  SPOILERS ALERT. SCROLL TO BOTTOM Tbh because I'm a certified Gardner stan, I wanted to toss this a lil three stars, but the final showdown solidified this 2 star (which is still generous, considering). So, we find out that Lea and Kaylee were in cahoots. This makes no damn sense because why would Kaylee hire Frankie to find Lea??? Apparently it was the lawyer's fault, but this felt like a cop-out because Kaylee could've easily said absolutely not and refused to see her. Instead, she makes things extra complicated by sending Frankie's stupid ass to the atoll to blow her spot up. There was absolutely no reason Frankie needed to be there. It was like Mariana in The Maidens. GIRL YOU DON'T EVEN GO HERE!!!Anyways, Kaylee somehow escapes death row and makes it to the atoll, where she lets the chopper sing and then WINKS at Frankie as she darts into hiding. But wait, it gets more cringey. Frankie and the gang go to Mac's cabin to 'hide out', and decides the best course of action is to blurt out LEA YOU DID IT in front of everyone, including Lea of course. Scooby Doo would never. And despite Frankie's certainty that Lea is involved, everyone, including an undercover FBI agent, lets Lea chill out while they wait for Kaylee and her accomplice (Bill) to ... idk? Kill them all I guess. But here is where things got laughable: Frankie decides to lure Kaylee and Bill to them by........... LEAVING OUT A BOWL OF HOT N FRESH SPAGHETTI. YES, YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY. Frankie believed that a hardened serial killer and death row escapee would give everything up for a bowl of spaghetti. If I'm going to surrender, it's not going to be for SPAGHETTI. Make it a filet mignon and we'll talk. Not only is this plan so childish, but the undercover FBI agent agrees that it's a great idea. Sir, you're fired. Don't even bother coming back to the mainland. Just let the coconut crabs have your ass. Because WHAT??? Again, this cannot be THEE Lisa Gardner writing this. And lastly, there was an incest twist. Was it necessary? Of course not. But was it absolutely disgusting? 100%. SPOILERS DONE Idk what happened here, but I didn't like it. Read Live to Tell instead. A banger.

Using the grizzly attacks as cover, Cates devises a method of violence identical to the bear killings and sets out to methodically check off his list.","C. J. Box continues to excite readers with unique crime thrillers that are full of suspense and action. The twenty-fourth book in the series featuring Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett is mostly set in October in Saddlestring, Wyoming. A rogue grizzly bear is on a rampage in an area where there aren’t supposed to be any. Additionally, Dallas Cates is released from prison and wants revenge on the people who sent him there and who he blames for killing his family. Meanwhile, Joe’s oldest daughter, Sheridan Pickett, takes on her first solo assignment as a master falconer.The characters are well defined. Readers get a good feel for Joe, his wife Marybeth, and Sheridan. Their characters have depth, and by this time in the series, they feel like well-known friends. Joe is conscientious as always. Marybeth is inciteful and looks at situations very differently than Joe. Sheridan loves her job and is better with people than her boss Nate Romanowski. I loved seeing how Sheridan grew as the story unfolded. The author does a great job of capturing the various characters and the cultural lifestyles and differences. The writing is fluid and descriptive which helps readers envision the scenes without disrupting or slowing the flow. There was a strong sense of place causing me to feel as though I was living the events alongside the characters. The dynamic plot has a tremendous amount of conflict and action that kept me engaged throughout. It is twisty and heartrending with exciting scenes, a murderous antagonist, and an incredible setting.Box is an excellent storyteller who continues to bring suspense throughout this novel. Those who follow the series will enjoy learning more about Joe’s family. What an ending! I didn’t expect some of that to happen. The author surprised this reader with two unexpected twists and set the stage for the next book. This is an unforgettable novel with the devastating events that occurred. Coming to terms with them and understanding the fallout from the events will undoubtedly be threads readers will see soon. Overall, this was intriguing, gritty, chilly, suspenseful, and action-packed with compelling characters that kept me turning the pages as I sat on the edge of my seat. With exciting scenes and fascinating story lines that converge, this fantastic crime thriller was intense and dramatic. It kept me on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the novel.

265,Twenty Years Later,Mystery,"But TWENTY YEARS LATER, to understand the present, you need to listen to the past… Avery Mason, host of American Events, knows the subjects that grab a TV audience’s attention. Her latest story—a murder mystery laced with kinky sex, tragedy, and betrayal—is guaranteed to be ratings gold. New DNA technology has allowed the New York medical examiner’s office to make its first successful identification of a 9/11 victim in years. The twist: the victim, Victoria Ford, had been accused of the gruesome murder of her married lover. In a chilling last phone call to her sister, Victoria begged her to prove her innocence. Emma Kind has waited twenty years to put her sister to rest, but closure won’t be complete until she can clear Victoria’s name. Alone she’s had no luck, but she’s convinced that Avery’s connections and fame will help. Avery, hoping to negotiate a more lucrative network contract, goes into investigative overdrive. Victoria had been having an affair with a successful novelist, found hanging from the balcony of his Catskills mansion. The rope, the bedroom, and the entire crime scene was covered in Victoria’s DNA. But the twisted puzzle of Victoria’s private life is just the beginning. And what Avery doesn't realize is that there are other players in the game who are interested in Avery’s own secret past—one she has kept hidden from both the network executives and her television audience. A secret she thought was dead and buried . . .  Accused of a brutal murder, Victoria Ford made a final chilling call from the North Tower on the morning of 9/11. Twenty years ago, no one listened. Today, you will.","I have a true affection for author Charlie Donlea, since his page-turning thrillers have busted me out of major reading slumps on more than one occasion. That said, his 2020 publication, The Suicide House, was a bit of a miss for me since there was just too much going on. So many characters, so many plot lines. While it pains me to say it, 2021’s Twenty Years Later suffers the same affliction. The start of this one feels like flipping through channels on TV. You bounce around from scene, character, and year, with a hope that at some point they’ll all come together. It took me until about the 30% mark to feel like I was getting invested in anything. Also, being a Donlea fan, I know that while his books can all be read as stand-alones, some of his characters pop up here and there. For example, his tried-and-true forensic pathologist Livia Cutty appears in a few scenes. The impact of this technique though made me constantly wonder if other characters were previously introduced in his other books and I’ve just forgotten them. Do their histories feel told rather than shown because there’s another entire book devoted to them? Or is this just another side effect of trying to cram too much into 300 pages?But here’s the real question for readers… Twenty years later, are you ready to read a thriller where the central storyline revolves around September 11th? Where real victims’ tragedy is exploited for entertainment value? Turns out I am not. I’ll direct you to the publisher synopsis, where there is an actual phone number* given to call. When I started writing this review, I was at 3.5 stars since I did end up flying through the back half of the book and still very much look forward to Donlea’s next one. But then I called that number. If it’s a spoiler to say what’s on the other end of the line, I really don’t care. It’s a recording of a fictionalized phone call from one of the characters stuck in the World Trade Center to her sister right before it collapses. I couldn’t even make it through 15 seconds of this absolutely vile marketing stunt. I hope the author didn’t approve this, and I hope it’s removed before major PR efforts roll out. *UPDATE (Sept. 2021): Since I initially posted this review back in June 2021, the publisher has removed the marketing stunt phone call I referenced from the book synopsis on Goodreads, Amazon and NetGalley. Wise decision!!!I received an advance readers copy to review courtesy of the publisher via Edelweiss. Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/",3.0

Hitler is threatening Europe, and world-weary Americans long for wonder. They find it in two giraffes who miraculously survive a hurricane while crossing the Atlantic. What follows is a twelve-day road trip in a custom truck to deliver Southern California’s first giraffes to the San Diego Zoo. Behind the wheel is the young Dust Bowl rowdy Woodrow. Inspired by true events, the tale weaves real-life figures with fictional ones, including the world’s first female zoo director, a crusty old man with a past, a young female photographer with a secret, and assorted reprobates as spotty as the giraffes.Part adventure, part historical saga, and part coming-of-age love story, West with Giraffes explores what it means to be changed by the grace of animals, the kindness of strangers, the passing of time, and a story told before it’s too late.","a really sweet coming-of-age story that combines american history, animal friends, and a cross-country roadtrip. quite the fun adventure!whist reading this, i could tell that it was well-researched. i actually learned some things about the dust bowl era, which was unexpected. i think this does a great job at taking true events and presenting them in a way that is quite readable.the overall vibe of the story reminded me a lot of 'water for elephants,' but i didnt quite find this as emotional or impactful, which is why my rating is pretty average. i was just hoping for a little bit more to make me fall in love with this, and i never got it.still a really lovely story that i know will find its way to multiple bookclubs.↠ 3.5 stars",3.0
267,Don’t Forget to Write,Historical Fiction,"In 1960, a young woman discovers a freedom she never knew existed in this exhilarating, funny, and emotional novel by the bestselling author of She’s Up to No Good . When Marilyn Kleinman is caught making out with the rabbi’s son in front of the whole congregation, her parents ship her off to her great-aunt Ada for the summer. If anyone can save their daughter’s reputation, it’s Philadelphia’s strict premier matchmaker. Either that or Marilyn can kiss college goodbye. To Marilyn’s surprise, Ada’s not the humorless septuagenarian her mother described. Not with that platinum-blonde hair, Hermès scarf, and Cadillac convertible. She’s sharp, straight-talking, takes her job very seriously, and abides by her own rules…mostly. As the summer unfolds, Ada and Marilyn head for the Jersey shore, where Marilyn helps Ada scope out eligible matches—for anyone but Marilyn, that is. Because if there’s one thing Marilyn’s learned from Ada, it’s that she doesn’t have to settle. With the school year quickly approaching and her father threatening to disinherit her, Marilyn must make her choice for her future: return to the comfortable life she knows, or embrace a risky, unknown path on her own.","Don’t Forget to Write is perfect for when you need something light and fun, but also with a heart. Marilyn Kleinman is home for the summer from college when she’s caught making out with the rabbi’s son in the synagogue, she’s sent off to her great-aunt’s. It’s 1960 and Ada is the premier matchmaker in Philadelphia. “She wasn’t warm and she suffered no fools. But no one had a better heart than this indomitable battle-ax before me.” Whenever Ada was in the picture, I was hooked. I was not as entranced with Marilyn. At times she verges on being petulant, acting more like 15 than 20. But then, she still had some growing up to do and had to learn how to stand up for herself and her beliefs. The story is true to the time and place, especially the New Jersey seaside, and it was so easy to envision every scene. The ending was perfect and I will admit to being caught off guard in one aspect. Prepare for lots of laughs and a few tears.

I don’t usually post a full-review of a manga/manhwa series I’ve read here, but Solo Leveling demands, at least, a little write-up because my god, everyone needs to bless their eyes and mind with the entertaining experience of reading this. It takes a lot for a manga/manhwa series to blow my mind now, and Solo Leveling accomplished this feat non-stop.Solo Leveling is a manhwa adaptation—illustrated by Gi So-Ryeong (기소령) and Jang Sung-Rak (장성락)—of a completed series of light novels with the same title that’s written by Chu-Gong. The official blurb from the light novel did a great job of explaining the premise without spoiling anything, so I’ll copy it here:

“10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as ""Hunters"". However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the ""World's Weakest"". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!” 

It’s a simple premise, nothing revolutionary, but it’s executed magnificently; Sung Jin-Woo’s journey in his endless pursuit of a stronger power was simply a blast to read. And I’m not saying that the manhwa is without its flaws. The author seemed to have forgotten—for almost 50 chapters—that the reason Sung Jin-Woo became a hunter in the first place was to earn money to pay for the medical expense of his sick mother. Plus, Sung Jin-Woo is just extremely overpowered. But you know what? I don’t care. This manhwa is a personification of badass main character and action scenes, and everything worked well for the story and medium; I’m willing to overlook the minor flaws in favor of the powerfully engrossing and immensely addictive reading experience. Also, I loved the nod to other popular franchises: One Punch Man training method, Alex Armstrong from Full Metal Alchemist cameo, and the design of Artorias the Abyss from Dark Souls. I could be wrong about these, of course, but they seemed too similar to be considered a coincidence, especially the later story arc resemblance to the Chimera Ant arc from Hunter x Hunter. Case in point:Picture: Igris from Solo Leveling.Picture: Artorias the Abyss from Dark Souls video game.Gi So-Ryeong (기소령) and Jang Sung-Rak (장성락) are virtuoso of illustrations; I truly believe that the reason this manhwa reaches the popularity and acclaim it has now is due to their irreplaceable contributions as an artist. The level of explosive actions and vivid artworks displayed in this manhwa, for the lack of a better term, is godlike. A picture is worth a thousand words, and rather than hearing me ramble on about how beautiful and well-drawn the illustrations are, I’ll provide proofs instead:Yes, every single panel of this manhwa is drawn with at least the superb caliber shown above.Solo Leveling is an outstandingly phenomenal manhwa that deserves all the praises it gets and more. Forgive me for saying this, but Season 1 of this series alone has made every other LitRPG I’ve ever experienced pale in comparison. Seriously, I honestly never thought I would ever read a LitRPG as addictive, mind-blowing, and page-turning as this, but here we are. I highly recommend this to pretty much everyone. Only Season 1 has been completed at the moment, but trust me when I say that this manhwa is going to take over the world. Join in the hype now. I can’t wait for Season 2 to begin and see the—hopefully—terrifying challenges the Sung Jin-Woo encounter.

270,City in Ruins,Fiction,"Following  City on Fire  and  City of Dreams ,  City in Ruins  is the explosive, impossible to put down conclusion to  New York Times  bestselling author Don Winslow’s epic, genre-defining crime trilogy and the final book of Winslow's extraordinary career. Sometimes you have to become what you hate to protect what you love. Danny Ryan is rich. Beyond his wildest dreams rich. The former dock worker, Irish mob soldier and fugitive from the law is now a respected businessman – a Las Vegas casino mogul and billionaire silent partner in a group that owns two lavish hotels. Finally, Danny has it a beautiful house, a child he adores, a woman he might even fall in love with. Life is good. But then Danny reaches too far. When he tries to buy an old hotel on a prime piece of real estate with plans to build his dream resort, he triggers a war against Las Vegas power brokers, a powerful FBI agent bent on revenge and a rival casino owner with dark connections of his own. Danny thought he had buried his past, but now it reaches up to him from the grave to pull him down. Old enemies surface, and when they come for Danny they vow to take  everything  – not only his empire, not just his life, but all that he holds dear, including his son. To save his life and everything he loves, Danny must become the ruthless fighter he once was – and never wanted to be again. Ranging from the gritty back rooms of Providence, RI to the power corridors of Washington, DC and Wall Street to the golden casinos of Las Vegas,  City in Ruins  is an epic crime novel of love and hate, ambition and desperation, vengeance and compassion.","City in Ruins is the epic conclusion to Winslow’s City on Fire-Danny Ryan crime fiction trilogy, charting the tragic fall of the warring Murphy and Moretti organized crime families in Providence, Rhode Island. These Irish and Italian mob families were always at war, but the troubles really started when Liam Murphy saw Helen of Troy (Pam Moretti) at the clambake on the beach. Like Paris of the Trojan War, Liam absconded with the goddess and the war began because Paulie Moretti had been disrespected and, by blood, Peter Moretti, too. The spectacular first novel in the series (City on Fire) is not to be missed and contains enough fireworks for a lot of Fourth of Julys. Book Two, City of Dreams, picks up with the aftermath of everything that happened in City on Fire. The survivors are barely able to hold it together. The Irish mob is decimated and Danny Murphy took what was left of his crew and headed to Hollywood with his well-connected mother’s help. A movie is being made about the fireworks in Providence with the Altar Boys being the named consultants. Murphy, after helping out the CIA with a raid on a drughouse and running off with proceeds, resurfaces in Hollywood, becomes the producer for the film, and has a hot romance with the star of the movies, falling for the star playing Pam’s role in the movie, and ending up on the cover of every newspaper and magazine in the country. All hell breaks loose. Meanwhile, back in Providence, the Morettis are at each other’s throats – literally, with essentially taking out each other in an intra-family feud of epic proportions. In the end, there is nowhere for any of these guys to turn because the old life is gone and the walls are all closing in on them. Now on to volume three- City in Ruins- as if there was any tragedy left to happen to these two families.City in Ruins primarily focuses on Danny Ryan with a few short glances at the Morettis with Peter Moretti, Jr., on trial for murdering the mob boss Vinnie and Peter’s own mother. Meanwhile, Chris Palumbo is living in North Dakota with a woman he met by accident, squirreling the money he has left in the attic and rafters and letting this woman support him. His wife Cathy is back in Providence, left holding the bag. The other Italian toughs think Chris walked away with millions in the drug money and they are going to take it out of Cathy’s businesses brick by brick dollar by dollar until she has nothing left to sell but herself. Chris can’t stay in hiding forever or can he? It is another tragedy bubbling up. Chris is like Odyseuss returning from twenty years away to find Penelope fighting off dozens of suitors and his young son not up to the task yet.Danny Ryan has resurrected himself like a phoenix rising from the ashes and is the hot new star of the Las Vegas Strip casinos, locked in an eternal competition with Vern Winegard for control of the strip. The dirty money from the mob and the drug house has been washed and diluted and Danny can control a casino fortune and date a legitimate woman. Nevertheless, the theme keeps coming up that Danny Ryan is not quite a legitimate businessman and no matter what deals he makes, his mob connections from the past keep coming up. There is no way to ever have fully clean hands for this generation.City in Ruins is a blockbuster finale to an epic crime trilogy charting the tragedy that are these two Providence crime families, trying to claw their way out of bloody hell.",5.0
271,Extinction,Thriller,"Erebus Resort, occupying a magnificent, hundred-thousand–acre valley deep in the Colorado Rockies, offers guests the experience of viewing woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths in their native habitat, brought back from extinction through the magic of genetic manipulation. When a billionaire's son and his new wife are kidnapped and murdered in the Erebus back country by what is assumed to be a gang of eco-terrorists, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Agent Frances Cash partners with county sheriff James Colcord to track down the perpetrators. As killings mount and the valley is evacuated, Cash and Colcord must confront an ancient, intelligent, and malevolent presence at Erebus, bent not on resurrection but on extinction.","In 
Extinction,
 Douglas Preston combines a technothriller with a police investigation. Erebus Resort occupies a large valley in Eagle County, Colorado, deep in the Rocky Mountains. It offers guests the unique experience of viewing six herbivores, including woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths, brought back from extinction through genetic manipulation. When billionaire Rolf Gunnerson’s son Mark and his wife Olivia are abducted while in the Erebus back county, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is called in to help the Eagle County sheriff’s department. This is Agent in Charge Frances Cash’s first case after her promotion to senior detective. She liaises with Sheriff James Colcord to investigate and tract down the culprits.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Cash is organized, detailed, goal-oriented, aggressive, foul-mouthed at times, sharp-tonged, and doesn’t like small talk. She’s viewed by her boss, McFaul, as lacking the public relations side of things and only being focused on solving her cases. Colcord is a movie buff, quiet, treats others with respect, and gets along with most people. However, he can also be forceful and take charge of situations.The author has penned a thriller with action, wonderful animals, plenty of adventure, great lead characters, and genetic engineering that is frightening, exciting, and thought-provoking. This riveting and suspenseful story kept be fully engaged from beginning to end. The plot is twisty with several shocking turns that caught me by surprise. The world-building was excellent from the back-country to the resort lodge to the laboratory. Themes include genetic engineering, deception, betrayal, death, greed, morality, work relationships, and much more.Overall, the book is tense, gripping, and suspenseful. It kept me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would be uncovered next. With great characterization and world-building as well as a fast pace, it’s also thought-provoking and terrifying at times. The afterward at the end of the book has some interesting information as well.

But she has no idea that Zara is flying them to Las Vegas to renew their vows.Zara Jones has recreated almost every detail of her parent’s original wedding - now her only challenge is tracking down the two friends who were pictured with her mum and dad back in 1993.Aiden Gregg is dealing with his own relationship woes when he receives an unexpected message from a complete stranger. With the help of Facebook, Zara has tracked him down and is asking if his parents are the other couple in the old photo? And if so, could he bring them to Vegas for a surprise reunion?What Zara and Aiden don’t know is that thirty years ago, One Moment In Time changed everything.Will rewinding the clock right the wrongs of the past?Or are they all counting down to a rendezvous with disaster?","In a Nutshell: Contains some surprises and some shocks, exactly as promised. Good for fans of women’s fiction as this is mostly an entertainer.Story Synopsis: Colin and Brenda got married almost thirty years ago in a chapel in Las Vegas. To celebrate their upcoming thirtieth wedding anniversary, their daughters Zara and Millie decide to give them a surprise by flying them from Glasgow to Las Vegas to renew their vows. The girls are also trying to locate the two strangers standing next to their parents in their wedding photo, hoping for a reunion of old friends.What the girls don’t know is that Brenda is secretly nursing regrets and planning to leave Colin soon. And they also don’t know that the two pairs of people in the photo might not necessarily be the best of friends. Playing a role in this complicate plan is Aiden Gregg, whom Zara tracked through Facebook to check if he knows the identity of the strangers in the wedding photo. As the strangers turn out to be his parents, he has to help Zara complete her plan by bringing them to Las Vegas in time for the reunion and the renewal of the vows. As you can expect, the well-intentioned surprise soon turns into a shocker. The story comes to us in the third person perspectives of Zara, Aiden, and their moms Brenda and Eileen.Bookish Yays:✔ The premise promises an entertaining read, and entertainment is what we get. There are many humorous scenes, balanced with some heartfelt relationship struggles. There’s love and lust and anger and pride and confusion – almost all the emotions that make this genre what it is.✔ The author’s choice of narrators was excellent. While there is a multitude of interesting characters in this book, the four voices she chose offer a balance of reason, emotion and confusion throughout the story. I am not saying that I liked all the four narrators, but I found them interesting character studies.✔ The remaining characters, whether appealing or irritating, are also written well. Of these, Millie was my favourite – I loved her unapologetic behaviour. But more importantly, I loved how her character growth wasn’t modified to make her fit into a conventional role by the end. Her essence stays the same throughout. The bond between siblings Zara and Millie is just awesome, though they are so contrary to each other.✔ It was a nice experience to see fifty-plus characters driving the story along with their young ones. I enjoyed the distinct portrayal of the four parents, each so different in personality.✔ The book takes its time to get rolling, with the initial one-third or so functioning more as a backstory than as the main plot. But once the main story sets off in Las Vegas, the ride is mostly quick and smooth. My patience was tested but also rewarded. ✔ Loads of love, no steam. Plus point for me; possible minus for some other readers. ✔ I liked *most* of the ending – it was realistic rather than contrived, and grew from the natural progression of the story and the characters. Not everyone gets a traditional HEA, and not everyone necessarily “matures”. Bookish Nays:❌ There are quite a few relationships dissolving and forming in the course of the plot. Most of these can be guessed well in advance, with one major exception. And this unexpected relationship was not at all convincing to me. It felt forced and rushed, not to mention very awkward. I couldn’t digest the fact that the characters involved accepted it so easily. ❌ The final quarter feels very rushed; too much happening too quickly. ❌ There’s much focus on the physical attributes and appearance of the characters. ⚠ Minor complaint: Can we please not have fictional besties sharing the same initials? Things get confusing! I was grateful that Bernadette didn’t have a longer role to play in Brenda’s arc. Overall, if you are a women’s fiction lover, then this book will offer you exactly what you expect from this genre – surprises and shocks, sweet moments and sad events, old heartaches and new bonds. While most of it goes as expected, the grounded ending elevates the experience. It will work well when you want a feel-good read mixing up light and heavy topics. This was my first Shari Low book, and I can see why she has so many fans. I would love to explore more of her works. 3.75 stars.My thanks to Boldwood Books and NetGalley for the DRC of “One Moment in Time”.

273,Judgment Prey,Mystery,"Alex Sand was spending the evening at home playing basketball with his two young sons when all three were shot in cold blood. A wealthy federal judge, there’s no short list of people who could have a vendetta against Sands, but the gruesome murders, especially that of his children, turn their St. Paul community on its head. Sand was on the verge of a major donation to a local housing charity, Heart/Twin Cities, and with the money in limbo, eyes suddenly turn to his grieving widow, Margaret Cooper, to see what she might do with the money. Margaret, distraught over the death of her family, struggles to move forward, and can’t imagine how or why anyone would target her husband.With public pressure mounting and both the local police force and FBI hitting dead end after dead end, Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers are called in to do what others could not: find answers. With each potential lead flawed, Davenport and Flowers are determined to chase every theory until they figure out who killed the Sands. But when they find themselves being stonewalled by the most unlikely of forces, the two wonder if perhaps each misdirection could lead them closer to the truth.","I love reading the Lucas series and I'm always giddy when Virgil makes a surprise appearance. Now that I know I can expect to see Virgil, part of that excitement is missing but hey I'm not gonna complain, I love when they team up. Lucas and Virgil are my favorite ""cop"" characters and I can count on them cracking jokes and playing off one another while they investigate the murders.After being shot multiple times in the previous novel, US Marshal Lucas is still recovering when his boss calls late at night about the murder of a respectable federal judge and his two teenage boys at their home.St. Paul PD, FBI, and BCA are on this high-priority case, but inevitably Lucas and Virgil join the hunt for the killer. I enjoyed this plotline a bit more than the other related mystery with the charity projects.Although, pretty unrealistic, Cooper and her pal are bonkers and their own investigation is very entertaining to witness. Imagine combing through their search history of ""how-to"", huh?Still, the very best part is Lucas and Virgil's sarcastic banter in Lucas' hybrid Cayenne while on the road from one suspect to the next. Great and fluid dialogs. And Virgil the novelist or is it Sandford's in the book? 🤩 I'm glad the author left politics out for the most part. What I'm uncertain about is the MOTIVE. It was never really explained, I can only assume... 4.5⭐Really miss Richard Farrone, RIP.💔Thank you G.P. Putnam's Sons for the DRCPublished Oct 3, 2023!",4.0
274,The Chaos Agent,Thriller,"A car accident in Japan.A drowning in Seoul.A home invasion in Boston.Someone is killing the world’s leading experts on robotics and artificial intelligence. Is it a tech company trying to eliminate the competition or is it something even more sinister?After all, artificial intelligence may be the deadliest battlefield gamechanger since the creation of gunpowder. The first nation to field weapons that can act at the speed of computer commands will rule the battlefield.It’s an irresistible lure for most, but not for the Gray Man. His quest for a quiet life has led him to Central America where he and his lover, Zoya Zakharova, have assumed new identities. With a list of enemies that  includes billionaires, terrorists, and governments, they need to keep a low profile, but the world’s deadliest assassin can’t expect to hide out forever.Eventually, they’re tracked down and offered a job by an old acquaintance of Zoya’s. He needs their help extracting a Russian scientist who is on the kill list. They reject the offer, but just being seen with him is enough to put assassins on their trail.Now, they’re back on the run, but no matter which way they turn, it's clear that whoever's tracking them is always going to be one step ahead. Since flight’s no longer possible, fight is the only option left, and no one fights dirtier than the Gray Man.","Mark Greaney brings together a contemporary topic, diverse characters, multiple settings, and plenty of action in the thirteenth novel in the Gray Man series. In this latest book artificial intelligence leads to a shocking and alarming scenario. Someone is killing the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and robotics. Is it a tech company eliminating the competition, a country intent on military superiority, or something even more ominous? The Gray Man - Court Gentry and Zoya Zakharova have assumed new identities and are living together in Guatemala. Both have governments and individuals as their enemies and are trying to keep a low profile. Unfortunately, that is about to change. They’re tracked down and offered a job by an acquaintance of Zoya’s. Despite rejecting the offer, being seen with him is enough to have assassins pursue them. On the run they realize that whoever wants them dead seems to be one step ahead of them. It’s time to fight back.Court, a former CIA operative, is drawn to danger, misses making an impact, and suffers from insomnia. Zoya is motivated by causes and mainly wants to survive. There are a host of additional characters, but it was easy to keep track of them. Readers get various points of view throughout the novel with the initial chapters introducing many of them and their situations.Greaney is an excellent storyteller who kept me on the edge of my seat with gripping scenes, action, a superb plot, and fantastic writing. In preparation for this series, he not only traveled to multiple countries but trained extensively in the use of firearms, battlefield medicine, and close-range combative tactics. The dynamic plot came alive and felt all too possible with real-world issues around artificial intelligence incorporated into the story highlighting the societal and political differences.A constant sense of urgency, a state of uneasiness, and lots of action combined with great characters and a well-written plot make this suspenseful novel a must read. My only quibble was one aspect of the ending. However, this undoubtedly sets the stage for the next book in the series. Themes include artificial intelligence, deception, trust, industrial espionage, violence, differing political and social ideologies, murder, and much more.Overall, this is a gripping, gritty, and chilling story with complex characters. It’s intense and dramatic and kept this reader turning the pages. I recommend this series to those who like political, action, and military thrillers. While this series is best read in order to fully understand the backstories of the main characters, this one worked as a standalone novel for me.Berkley Publishing Group and Mark Greaney provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

275,Dark Dive,Mystery,"A Wall Street Journal bestselling series. Searching for a missing diver takes a Florida detective on a deep-diving adventure in a gripping thriller by the Amazon Charts bestselling author of Sea Castle . After the Underwater Investigation Unit’s disbandment, public outcry ushers Sloan McPherson and her partner, former navy diver Scott Hughes, back into the depths of crime solving. But Sloan’s return comes with a personal case. Longtime family friend Fred Stafford has disappeared. Left his abandoned truck in the vicinity of an unmarked sinkhole and new findings that have Sloan second-guessing everything she thought she knew about the man. There are his gambling debts, his association with a treasure-hunting band of underwater cavern junkies called the Dive Rats, and most alarming of all, a discovery in Stafford’s storage shed that raises the stakes even higher and plunges Sloan into an unfathomable mystery. As Sloan’s investigation unfolds, a tragic Florida cold case, local superstitions, and a shocking conspiracy collide. For Sloan, finding Stafford and uncovering the buried secrets of the past soon drag her deeper into the dark unknown than she feared.","I have a theory (of course I do). By book five in a mystery series, we know it is going to be, well, A Series, meaning the author has developed a brand, certain genre conventions will be adhered to and, most importantly, the author has practiced enough to be decent at what they are doing. But here’s the hypothesis part: the author finally has enough publishing security to start to challenge themselves and the readers to break from earlier patterns. I present as evidence Matthew Scudder book 5 and 6, (Eight Million Ways to Die and When the Sacred Ginmill Closes), two of my favorites; Elvis Cole 4 and 6 (Free Fall and Sunset Express); Charlie Parker 4 and 6 (The White Road and The Unquiet). Possibly I could go on, but this is about Mayne and how Dark Dive, book five in Payne’s Underwater Investigation series, dares to diverge from its predecessors and becomes an even more interesting book.The series is about a statewide Underwater Investigations Unit which ostensibly is brought in when there are cases that involve diving, particularly evidence retrieval. It is a small unit, comprised of a charismatic, politically-savy head, George; our narrator and archeologist in-training, Sloan; ex-Navy diver and tech-geek, Hughes, introduced in book 2; and the more recent ex-PD detective and data miner, Gwen, from book 4. (If you are getting the feeling you should read the series in order, that is quite possibly true. It depends on your tolerance for continuity). Prior to this, the Unit had seen some rocky political ground and temporary disbandment, but all is copacetic now. As a reader, I found this a huge relief; while intrusive agency politics may be a draw for some, I find them about as fun as kingdom politics in fantasy series, which is to say, hardly at all. It is enjoyable to witness the team each perform their roles in competent ways and try to solve the puzzles they are presented with.And what a puzzle! A dive shop owner is concerned a well-known but eccentric diver has gone missing; the soon-to-be ex-girlfriend had filed a missing persons report but his new diving buddies are clueless and strangely unconcerned. As Sloan starts asking questions, she discovers she hardly knew the man. The case gets more complex in diverging but extremely interesting ways and I was on board for it, if a little confused once or twice. But here’s the thing–I want to re-read it because of it. It is one of those mysteries where the complexity invites one to think and reconsider, much like re-watching a magic trick. “Wait, show me again,” is, in my estimation, a good response to have in both scenarios.Writing continues to improve. Sloan’s main focus in the case and she doesn’t spend a ton of time in the emotional back-and-forth of family dynamics, one of the areas where I have historically felt characterization was more weak. The endless glades of southern Florida really come alive, as do the deep sinkholes, and I felt myself in that muggy, grassy plain listening to insects buzz. Yep, definitely want to re-read it again (but honestly, not revisit the Glades again). There are a few spots where I felt a careful editor might have improved sentence flow or word choice, but on the whole, I'm going to say it's above competent.My deepest hesitation is the ending, which felt a little like it jumped the shark. Well, whatever; got to give the genre what it expects, I suppose, but that was what left me with the most questions the next day. Aside from that, it would have been an easy five stars for an engaging story and puzzling mysteries. I definitely recommend it.many thanks to Netgalley for the advanced e-copy for review. all opinions are you know, like, my own, man",5.0
277,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.""

EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
278,Catching Fire,Young Adult,"Flames are spreading.And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create. Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.","I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don’t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. Catching Fire was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don’t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass Katniss Everdeen, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything’s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn’t start out that way. It’s very Lord of the Flies, and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale, but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It’s a big party, and they’re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she’s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy, and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I’m not the hero. So, that’s about three times this month that I’ve been on the side of terrorists. I don’t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin’ pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there’s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I’m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you’re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!)When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn’t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called “True Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.” The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It’s a seriously creepy theory, but I’m not kidding when I say that she’s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I’ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don’t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as “violence is not the answer” or, on the other side of the argument, “destroy civilization.” I’m not positive what the right answer is, but I’d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives?So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don’t know if you’ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil.",5.0
279,Mockingjay,Young Adult,"Why am I not dead?I should be dead.Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss.The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the personal cost.","SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one! She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray). The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that ""this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!"" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions. That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: ""I must be the Mockingjay"", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the ""normal, average teen"" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like ""Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that."" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of ""realism"" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this ""Diary of an Emo Puppet."" This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title ""girl who was on fire"" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say ""Enough is enough."" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old. I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book). Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and ""give up on mankind""? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:""Because,"" said Harry, ""sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!""""You're seventeen, boy!""""I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!"" a few sentences later .. ""I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.""Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature.",2.0
280,Divergent,Young Adult,"In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.","What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.  Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another. Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of. AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me.",2.0
281,Insurgent,Young Adult,"But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.New York Times bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.","I want to give a big old round of applause to HarperTEEN and their insane marketing campaign. Bravo. That is not mockery, but a legit salute. I sincerely have to give it up to you for convincing me that I had to own this book. I was caught up and boarded the Twitter hype train as it drove me round and round the blogosphere's Factions. (BTW, I still don't know who drives the damn train.) So, by the time I stepped into my local bookstore and laid eyes on Insurgent I happily handed over my $17.99. I wasn't thinking logically. It was as if I was under a simulation. (HAHAHA! Did you see what I did there?)And that ending? Ugh. I... I... I need a moment. Let me just stop myself right here before I end up writing a really negative review and 1 starring one of the most anticipated books of 2012. But know I am displeased. VERY. Just look at how long it took me to finish the book! -----------------------------------------------What a shame. The most anticipated book of 2012 is my most disappointing read so far. After all the positive reviews I read, I knew for sure I'd love it. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. I was conflicted on whether to give this book one or two stars. In the end, Insurgent's saving grace is that it simply doesn't belong with some of my other one starred books. So, I feel I must warn whoever stumbles across this review: If this is one of your favorite series and you love it with the burning passion of a supernova, this review might have the potential to piss you off. It might be best for both you and I if you just hit the back button now before things get going. Go on. Spock and I will wait.*whistles*Oh, you're staying, huh? Well, strap yourself in because I have a feeling it might just be one of those reviews...Spock tells me this review must contain mild spoilers in order to logically explain this illogical novel. Sorry, kids. Spock's call.The first big negative right off the bat was that Insurgent picks up directly after Divergent left off. There is virtually no recap to the story or characters and if you read the book a year ago, well, you may be screwed. But thankfully, Roth wrote up a lovely little cheat sheet for just this purpose. Yay! However, the problem doesn't just lie with remembering names. It lies with the connection the reader may or may not have had with the characters in Divergent, which was now non-existent since I could barely remember who was who. What's that you say? So and so just got shot in the head? I'm sorry, I can't find a single fuck to give. Then, we are introduced to even more characters. So, not only do I have to attempt to remember the old characters, but I have to keep track of these newbies too? That's just way too much work. Obviously, this isn't really Insurgent's fault, but I thought it would helpful to point this out.The Plot:What happened here? What happened to the action packed dystopian series I was introduced to in Divergent? Where the hell was Tris and why was Bella playing her role? Why did Four suddenly update his Facebook status to Douche Bag? Who's idea was it to turn Insurgent into a Dystopian Romance? One thing I loved about Divergent was that the romance took a back seat to the story and action. But in Insurgent the action is scattered with a heavier focus on Tris and Four's relationship. Look, that is not what I signed up for. I really don't care if Four loves Tris or if they'll end up riding a unicorn that poops rainbows as they ride off into the sunset. Whatever, whatever, whatever.So, the Erudite are trying to take over their world by creating a new serum for those that are Divergent while the Factionless plan a rebellion. But all that usually happens in the background with occasional mention to keep the reader up to date. Most of the novel we are stuck in Tris' head as she goes into angst mode over Four, her parents and Will. It was so boring I felt like I was stuck in a throwback episode of As the World Turns. On repeat. Save me. But wait! We have a random plot twist at the end right before the battle is about to go down. Marcus (Four's abusive father) decides to enlist Tris to help him retrieve information stolen from Abnegation. He tells her it's super secret and that he can't tell her what it is because it's something you have to see, that she'll just have to trust him. Doing so would betray Four. She agrees.Wait. Pause.Tris hates Marcus. Tris loves Four. Tris doesn't know what information they would be retrieving. She also doesn't know if Marcus is telling her the truth. She has absolutely no reason to believe him. No real evidence to back up his claim. She agrees. Without much thought. Tris is supposed to have an aptitude for Erudite, right? She's supposed to be logical, RIGHT?!Tris, pack your bags. I think Spock has just voted you off the island.That makes no sense! And then when I found out the super big secret, guess what? He could have easily told her! I smell and easy plot cop-out, folks. The secret is kept long enough from the reader just so it can push you off the cliff on the last page.World Building:In Divergent I let a lot slide and roll off me because I was entertained throughout the entire book. I'm known to do that with a lot of books like Wither and Across the Universe, for example. I could not do it with Insurgent. You see, I have the attention span of a fruit fly. If I'm not fully engaged in the book, I'm going to notice things. Things I probably wouldn't care too much about if I were enjoying myself. Like how the Erudite wear glasses just because they're smart. Or how even though Tris is emotionally unbalanced 16-year-old, everyone still looks to her to ""analyze the situation."" Or even how impossible I find these factions. How is it that you can put all of these traits into neat little boxes and ask a person to choose one over the others? This is the same problem I had with The Hunt. In both novels the author tries to pitch an idea of human behavior completely different from what reality is, but you can clearly see the flaws with it. However, the main character fully believes in that world and way of thinking. They try to rationalize it, convince you of it. Yes, I realize it's a Dystopian novel, but this is a hard concept to sell because it makes it difficult for me to sympathize with the main character, their conflicted feelings and understand their world. Believability is key for me and I have a hard time believing this world. Tris frequently switches back and forth between her Dauntless, Erudite and Abnegation sides. Other characters comment on her embracing one trait depending on what the situation calls for it. But this doesn't work for me. Real talk, you can't just put logical thinking back in the toy chest when you decide you don't want to play with it anymore. It doesn't work like that. At least... I don't think so. Spock?I'm getting no-ish vibes.Tris:This series gets a lot of comparisons to The Hunger Games and in a way I can see why. You have your young girl who, one way or another, plays an important part in bringing forth change to her society. And if I really had to compare the two, I'd say that Insurgent is like Mockingjay. Tris is depressed, struggling to hold it together and fight in the war. The difference comes into play when Tris borderline gives up, while Katniss kicked ass until the very end. I'm not saying Tris didn't have the right to be depressed because I do believe she did. But it was really over done for me. I felt like I was drowning in her angst. This book is over 500 pages long and most of the action doesn't even show up to the party until the last 30 pages! So what was Tris doing for the other 500 pages? Not a damn thing. No, scratch that. Spock tells me that is inaccurate. Tris was in fact doing something. She was off being selfless, trying to get herself killed so that no one else would die. Bella is that you? I didn't know you did Dystopias now! That irritated me to no end. At one point she turns herself into the Erudite because they threatened to kill off people until Divergent started surrendering. So, of course, Tris thinks it has to be her and sneaks off to give herself up before the Dauntless can form a plan. Now, let's think about this logically. Tris knows the Erudite want to experiment on her for a Divergent-proof serum. Which means more people would be enslaved and/or killed because of her turning herself in. *facepalm* Then she almost dies, but it was too late because I had run out of fucks by then! So I had to shake Spock down for some.


What do you mean you're out of fucks?! One of us has to care if Tris lives or dies!
The Ending:Okay, lots of spoilers here, folks. Spoilers all around from this point on.I didn't like the ending. I felt cheated because I had hung on for the ending. Everyone said how it made up for the rest of the book and what not, but here's the thing: The ending couldn't make up for all the angst-filled fluff the rest of the book was stuffed with. I didn't feel the anticipation throughout the novel and I hate to admit that I was really tempted to skim. The villan was killed really fast without much of a fight. I always hate when that happens. The villan has been giving the characters hell all throughout the story and by the time their number is up, they beg for their life and die by a simple stab wound?""Yes, if you kill me you'll never find the information!""*stabby stab*>insert blood and stuff<""UGH! I'M MELTING!""*dies*


Still no fucks I see. That's cold, bro.
And the big secret wasn't anything you couldn't have guessed from Divergent. It's revealed that the world is in chaos outside of the fence. Murders, destruction, etc. The weird thing is that I actually forgot about their society being enclosed in the fence until it was brought up near the end. It totally slipped my mind. But, I digress. The entire point of their society was to be a fresh start to the world. Somehow by boxing people in these Factions and waiting for the Divergent to emerge that equates to saving humanity. I'm not exactly sure how that works since the book just ends with that revelation and the Acknowledgements rolled. But I feel like Roth wrote herself all the way to a deserted island, sent up her S.O.S. signal and that cliffhanger fell right out of the sky to the rescue. *sigh* I really hate cliffhangers. It was one of the things that I liked about Divergent. For the most part things were tied up, but with Insurgent? It's quite the mess we'll be walking into in book three.Will I read the next book? Yes, because I've come this far and I'm hoping I will enjoy book three as much as I enjoyed Divergent. I think Insurgent suffers from ""Second Book Syndrome"" and the infamous ""Hype Train,"" may it die in a fire (the Hype Train, not the book). But ultimately, I'm interested in how Roth will explain away everything. Maybe then this whole series will make perfect logical sense to me. Until then, drink time, Spock?More reviews and shenanigans at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.",2.0
282,The Lightning Thief,Fantasy,"Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found herePercy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friends—one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.","Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.”
As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible: it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from the Harry Potter universe. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.
Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.
Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him ""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.
""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”
Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.
“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""
A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.
Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.
Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...
""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""
...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He's not alone, he's accompanied by the snarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth (she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well as the most incompetent satyr that ever lived.
In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.
It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, and the myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.
Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”
And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.
“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”
The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.
“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""
I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed. his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""
I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”
He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.
“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”
I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.
“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”
Overall: a fantastic book. A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick. I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",4.0
283,The Maze Runner,Young Adult,"If you ain’t scared, you ain’t human. When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers—boys whose memories are also gone. Nice to meet ya, shank. Welcome to the Glade. Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive. Everything is going to change. Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying. Remember. Survive. Run.","You know how sometimes you're running really fast from a horrible creature and, in a moment of panic, you turn around to see how close it is only to run straight into a brick wall?No?I don't know what that's like either. But that inattention to detail would probably totally screw you over because a.) now you're knocked unconscious and b.) the creature is going to devour you. Good job.I guess this is kind of like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom only to be turned into a pillar of salt. And it is also kind of like reading The Maze Runner. Stick with me. The first half of James Dashner's The Maze Runner maintains a superbly frantic pace. Thomas, our empty-shell-of-a-protagonist is thrust, via the Box, into a curious and unfriendly world populated by dozens of teenage boys. He remembers nothing, and the boys are uncooperative, refusing to reveal any details regarding their home, the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by stupendously tall walls, outside of which lays the Maze. During the day, the Maze is (kinda sorta) safe. But at night, the Grievers emerge. These are half slug/half woodshop tools that enjoy slicing and dicing apart anyone unfortunate to encounter them. They can also sting you, which causes much mayhem and requires the administering of Grief Serum, which triggers the Changing. SIDEBAR!What Is It With Authors Of Dystopian Novels Capitalizing Really Important Words? It's Annoying. Find A New Stylistic Approach That I Can Later Become Exasperated With.Anyway, Thomas' situation is bleak, made bleaker when a number of unfortunate coincidences causes him to bear witness to some truly awful acts of violence. Let's just say one untrustworthy soul is unwittingly tossed into the Maze at night and then a girl (not a boy!!!!!!!!) suspiciously arrives the day after Thomas. All of this, despite the Unnecessary Capitalization and the boys using completely pointless terminology like klunk and shuckface, is totally kitty fantastico. The constant psychological mystery keeps nagging doubts at bay and the variety of personalities that populate the Glade is totally believable. They talk like teenagers, they (generally) act like teenagers, and they form cliques and factions the way teenagers would. (From here on I'm covering up ""spoilers"", even though I think they're total nonsense and hilariously awful. And because I advise you not to read this book, you should click them. Just keeping the haters at bay.)Then Thomas spends a night in the Maze.And the book falls apart. For those of you paying attention, here's where the running into a brick wall metaphor arrives full gale.Dashner, whose prose has heretofore been mediocre but serviceable, completely fails his audience. He writes himself into a corner. He knows it, we know it. Thomas, who has always been slightly unlikeable and jerky becomes even more unlikeable and jerky, and the plot holes start opening up like the really bad similes peppered throughout the narrative. How does Dashner patch them up? Telepathy! Seriously. Telepathy! Yup. The girl who mysteriously appeared communicates with Thomas with her mind and tells him all sorts of shit that's supposed to clear everything up. It doesn't. It just creates a frustrating deus ex machina that could have been avoided, but isn't.As Thomas's character stumbles upon more and more unbelievable clues, like the moving walls of the maze actually form patterns of letters (that Thomas will eventually and conveniently know what to do with after experiencing the Changing himself), the book loses its momentum significantly. In fact, despite tearing through the first half of the book, I had to put it down. Afterwards, every time I looked at that stupid green cover, I found myself filled with dread - knowing full well that what remained would irritate me. And it did.Sometimes when the first book of a trilogy ends on a cliffhanger, I feel compelled to continue. I don't care what happens to Thomas and the rest of the characters. Maybe they'll smoke lots of pot, form a commune, and grow daisies. Maybe they'll turn into Grievers. Maybe they'll run into Katniss and Peeta and become BFFs. But I will let you, gentle reader, find that out for yourself.",2.0
284,Allegiant,Young Adult,"So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.","Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case of Allegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will be MASSIVE SPOILERS for all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate1. The World BuildingWhen you think about both Divergent and Insurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions in Divergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. In Insurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end of Insurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get to Allegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end of Insurgent was for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there's not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it. As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way in Insurgent and she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her. Those mistakes made Tris human. But in Allegiant? she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is. c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory. His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn't find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling. After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all of Allegiant being broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. In Insurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. In Allegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect. The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and the deus ex machina moments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can't wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.	Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that's fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son. ...what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris's growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it. First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb's redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an accessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not? I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing? She was running into her mother’s arms and asking if she could be finished. Wanting to be done, implying a choice, even though she JUST told Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn’t want to leave him. If she’d gone down fighting, I’d have bought this more. But she seemed to welcome death - to want it - and that reverts her straight back to the things she supposedly learned she DIDN’T want in InsurgentI don’t understand why Tris’s death did anything to make that message more real. If anything it makes it less so. It’s easy to band together in grief - to find the people who understand and cling to them and form a stronger bond while you do. We saw that already with Christina and Uriah. I think this book wouldn’t have been able to gloss over everything if Tris had lived. Like Uriah’s injury and demise, a lot of this ending was hurriedly tied up with her death. We didn’t have to see what really happened in the aftermath. We didn’t have to deal with the choices for society. Tris’s death was sand for the characters to bury their heads in. This book didn't have a hopeful ending because nothing really changed. 90% of the characters are dead and everyone forgives everyone almost everything because they care about them? This is the foundation of rebuilding and stability upon which these characters and this world can grow? I’d have given up Tris (and Tris and Four) if it left Four and the the people she cared about with strength and hope and a better world, but I didn’t see that it did.  Things that Worked for me in Allegiant, a list by Kate1. There was a lot of making out.2. Though I wanted more from the ending, Four's pain was certainly poignant.",2.0

Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered.""It's cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she needed sleep. [Nope, this isn't your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH!

[Sheesh. I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured.

Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb? And why does she have a bunch of shoes, anyway? Am I the only one who remembers that she's a fucking FORMER-ASSASSIN-NOW-SLAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!]'Philippa huffed. ""Just don't tell them I helped you when you get dragged back here.""' [Sure, because if Celaena says nothing, they'll probably assume it was one of her other, non-existent maids who helped her navigate her way into her dress.]'Frowning, Chaol watched his friend dance with the assassin. He wouldn't have danced with her, anyway. And he was glad he hadn't worked up the nerve to ask her, not after seeing the color that Duke Perrington's face turned upon discovering the pair.' [WTF is the author Chaol talking about? What actually happens five minutes prior to this is that Celaena asks him to dance and he says no. Also, this guy's kind of a wussy-with-a-""p"" for a Captain of the Guard. He's never even killed anyone before. Yeesh. Captain of the Guard, my foot.]' ... Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king ... ' [That's what they keep saying, but the king isn't even present in the castle for the majority of the competition, so ... ]Oh, one more thing: THE NAMES! How the heck do you pronounce Chaol? Kale? Like the cabbage? And Kaltain Rompier has to be one of the stupidest names I've EVER come across. It makes me think of frolicking unicorns, or ... something. As for the main character, well, I don't even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that's the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don't even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I'll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existent throne of glass that the book's apparently named after? Thinly-veiled CINDERELLA references FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone for Cinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don't get much more than that. I don't even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don't know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you'd otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses, Cinderella Celaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high. It's ... exciting stuff. Really.Also, since when do slaves have possessions? Why does some random slave (who immediately gets murdered by some random people, so yay for the Drama Llama) have enough salve to pass around as required? Who makes this salve? From what? Who are these slaves allowed to associate with that they can procure salve? What do they trade for this salve? Their bodies? Their hair? Salt they've squirrelled away from the mines? Yeesh! Explain yourself, Sarah J. Maas!UGH! Terrible, terrible, horrendous. Nonsensical, stupid, pointless. Fluffy, pathetic, ridiculous. Need I say more? Really? Need I?

I've read far better action scenes from guys like John Sandford who actually write thrillers that have plots that hang together and don't trot out every action movie cliche in the process. Plus, there are massive gaps in logic. A murder victim turns out to be a federal agent who is working on a super-secret case that is so important that it literally threatens the United States. Yet, after he's killed and it's reported, nobody else from the government even shows up to check it out. WTF? I can gloss over unrealistic procedural stuff in the interest of a good story, but since this isn't a good story, the plot loopholes are too horrible to ignore.Another problem is that Child couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write just an action novel or a detective story, and he tried to split the difference. Not good. Reacher is the worst fictional detective I've ever read. Giant clues are put in front of him that anyone who has ever read a book or seen an episode of television since 1962 would instantly recognize, but he misses them. Yet, when called for, he can make ludicrous leaps of intuition that would make Sherlock Holmes scratch his head at the sheer implausibility of them. This might have been a better book if Reacher was just a revenge driven killing machine mowing through the bad guys without the pretense of playing detective.This would have been 1 star, but I gave it an extra star because the main piece of the criminal plot is actually kind of clever and not something I'd read before. Unfortunately, it's the only original thing in this book.** Update 4/10/16 - I recently read another crime novel that used an identical idea of  bleaching $1 bills to use for counterfeiting purposes. Since that book was published 36 years before this one it seems a lot less original then I initially thought so I took away that second star.",1.0

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0

289,The House of Hidden Meanings,Memoir,"From international drag superstar and pop culture icon RuPaul, comes his most revealing and personal work to date—a brutally honest, surprisingly poignant, and deeply intimate memoir of growing up Black, poor, and queer in a broken home to discovering the power of performance, found family, and self-acceptance. A profound introspection of his life, relationships, and identity,  The House of Hidden Meanings  is a self-portrait of the legendary icon on the road to global fame and changing the way the world thinks about drag. Central to RuPaul’s success has been his chameleonic adaptability. From drag icon to powerhouse producer of one of the world’s largest television franchises, RuPaul’s ever-shifting nature has always been part of his brand as both supermodel and supermogul. Yet that adaptability has made him enigmatic to the public. In this memoir, his most intimate and detailed book yet, RuPaul makes himself truly known. Stripping away all artifice, RuPaul recounts the story of his life with breathtaking clarity and tenderness, bringing his signature wisdom and wit to his own biography. From his early years growing up as a queer Black kid in San Diego navigating complex relationships with his absent father and temperamental mother, to forging an identity in the punk and drag scenes of Atlanta and New York, to finding enduring love with his husband Georges LeBar and self-acceptance in sobriety, RuPaul excavates his own biography, uncovering new truths and insights in his personal history. Here in RuPaul’s singular and extraordinary story is a manual for living—a personal philosophy that testifies to the value of chosen family, the importance of harnessing what makes you different, and the transformational power of facing yourself fearlessly. If we’re all born naked and the rest is drag, then this is RuPaul totally out of drag. This is RuPaul stripped bare.","Don't go into 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗘 𝗢𝗙 𝗛𝗜𝗗𝗗𝗘𝗡 𝗠𝗘𝗔𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦 looking for celebrity dirt (although there is one telling story about Madonna). Instead, RuPaul uses this memoir to reflect on his dysfunctional upbringing and the battles he fought to not only to become a star, but just to survive.Listening to him tell his story, it's not the hyped up, over-the-top superstar you see on Drag Race. This is the vulnerable and scarred queer black boy who grew up in the South. He stresses the importance of taking what makes you different and finding a way to making it your superpower, and also how much of a role self-belief plays in finding your way. Ru had to reinvent himself over and over in order to achieve what he has, and there's a lesson in that for all of us - it's never too late to start again.",4.0

291,One Way Back: A Memoir,Memoir,"The compelling true story behind the testimony that awed the nationOn September 27, 2018, Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee which was considering the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. She described an alleged sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee that took place at a high school party in the 1980s. Her words and courage on that day provided some of the most credible and unforgettable testimony our country has ever witnessed.  In One Way Back , Ford recounts the months she spent trying to get information into the right hands without exposing herself and her family to dangerous backlash. Drawing parallels to her life as a surfer, she explains the process of paddling out into unknown waters despite the risks and fears, knowing there is only one way back to shore. The book reveals riveting new details about the leadup to her testimony and its overwhelming aftermath and describes how she continues to navigate her way out of the storm.This is the real story behind the headlines and the soundbites, a complex, page-turning memoir of a scientist, a surfer, a mother, a patriot and an unlikely whistleblower. Ford’s experience shows that when one person steps forward to speak truth to power, she adds to a collective whole, causing ""a ripple that might one day become a wave.”","Dr. Ford's story of how she tried to get her story out as well as the abuse she suffered before, during, and after her testimony is an indictment of our current political climate. Sadly, it's no surprise that the FBI didn't follow-up on the more than 4500 calls to the FBI Tip Line about Kavanaugh, nor did they even interview her in their so-called investigation after her testimony. Along with Catch and Kill, One Way Back shines a spotlight on how abusive powerful men are protected.",5.0
292,"The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church",Nonfiction,"Persistently worried that her gay grandfather would go to hell unless she could reach him, or that her Muslim friend would need to be converted, and that she, too, would go to hell if she did not believe fervently enough, McCammon was a rule-follower and--most of the time--a true believer. But through it all, she was increasingly plagued by fears and deep questions as the belief system she'd been carefully taught clashed with her expanding understanding of the outside world.After spending her early adult life striving to make sense of an unraveling worldview, by her 30s, she found herself face-to-face with it once again as she covered the Trump campaign for NPR, where she witnessed first-hand the power and influence that evangelical Christian beliefs held on the political right. McCammon also came to discover that she is among a rising generation of the children of evangelicalism who are growing up and fleeing the fold, who are thinking for themselves and deconstructing what feel like the “alternative facts” of their childhood.Rigorously reported and deeply personal, The Exvangelicals is the story of the people who make up this generational tipping point, including McCammon herself. Part memoir, part investigative journalism, this is the first definitive book that names and describes the post-evangelical movement--identifying its origins, telling the stories of its members, and examining its vast cultural, social, and political impact.","As a member of what I consider the Christian Left, I often wonder if I’m reading the same Bible as the Evangelicals that follow Trump. Where is the compassion for our fellow man? Where is the concern, not just for an embryo, but also the child? So, I was interested to see what Sarah McCammon had to say about the supposed growing number of younger people leaving the movement. I think one of the important things she says is that it’s not just a religious sect, it’s a community and a culture and leaving it often leads to the loss of family and friends. McCammon walks the reader through the mindset of the Evangelical culture, especially the belief that the Bible is infallible, scientists are not to be trusted and only they know the “truth”. She spends a lot of time on their refusal to believe in evolution. It actually gave me a better understanding of how so many can fall for Trump’s claptrap. When your belief system doesn’t allow for any wavering or skepticism, for any allowance for change, it makes it more plausible that you’ll only accept the “facts” that suit your narrative, regardless of their accuracy. “Information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe’s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. ‘Good for our side’ and ‘true’ begin to blur into one.”The one problem I had with the book is that she never really makes her case for “the massive social movement” of people leaving the evangelical church. She cites individuals and their reasons - LGBTQ+ issues, women’s roles, sexual freedom and corporal punishment. But I never got a sense of how many people she was talking about. Likewise, while I found the section on religious trauma enlightening, I was curious to know how widespread it was. Maybe there’s no way to know. But I would have been interested to know if there were any studies. This is probably a book that will “preach to the choir”. I can’t envision many still firmly invested in the evangelical movement reading it. But maybe it will provide a sense of community to those who have left but feel they’re alone in their situation. I was impressed by the number of folks she mentions that have social media presences. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.Update - this book is really sticking with me. I find myself recommending it right and left.",4.0
293,Cloistered: My Years as a Nun,Nonfiction,"An astonishing memoir of twelve years as a contemplative nun in a silent monastery.Cloistered takes the reader deep into the hidden world of a traditional Carmelite monastery as it approaches the third Millennium and tells the story of an intense personal journey into and out of an enclosed life of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Finding an apparently perfect world at Akenside Priory, in Northumberland, Catherine trusts herself to a group of twenty silent women, believing she is trusting herself to God. As the beauty and mystery of an ancient way of life enfold her, she surrenders herself wholly to its power, quite unaware of the complexity and dangers that lie ahead.Cut off from the wider world for decades, the community has managed to evade accountability to any authority beyond itself. When Sister Catherine realises that a mesmerising cult of the personality, with the distortions it entails, has replaced the ancient ideal of religious obedience, she is faced with a dilemma. Will she submit to this, or will she be forced to speak out?An exploration of the limits of trust, Cloistered shows us how far youthful idealism can take us along the road of self-surrender, and of how much harm is done when institutional flaws go unacknowledged. Catherine’s honest account of her time in the monastery – and her dramatic flight from it – is both a love song to a lost community and an exploration of what is most compelling, yet most potentially destructive when closed human groups become laws unto themselves.","I love reading about the secret culture of nuns, and since this was an actual memoir I was even further intrigued. A young woman in her twenties found refuge in the Catholic Church after the death of her father. She joined the Carmelite order, embracing the silence. Her ""cell"" which was her assigned bedroom in Akenside Priory was a safe haven, with its large, spare black cross, its white walls, rolling hills of greenery out the window, and most of all- its solitary quiet. However, during her twelve years within its confines, Catherine experienced cliques, politics, unfairness, and power plays. I felt a bit detached reading the many passages that went into the weeds about the deep religious concepts. It was all ""over my head"" and I didn't feel like delving into those tenets. There was also a lot of talk about nature because of the locale of the monastery and the necessity of the nuns working the property, tending the gardens. I'm not a fan of extensive conversation and description about nature either. I did feel a kinship with Catherine feeling the peace and quiet of her room, as she gazed out her window at the gentle, rolling fields. I enjoyed learning about the intake process and inner workings of living the Carmelite order, including the schedules for each day. The person who was the most gifted at cooking quite possibly would not be the one assigned to cook. I loved hearing about the bread baking, mixing up dried milk (because it was cheaper), having a ""Little Jug"" (a quick, small breakfast eaten standing up before chores), and the half hour set aside for conversation each day. It was very disturbing hearing about some of the diabolical maneuverings.This book clocked in at just over 350 pages, which felt pretty long. If some of the religious philosophical meanderings and nature talk could have been excised out, I would have enjoyed this memoir even more, as it was a pretty interesting story.Thank you to the publisher St. Martin's Press who provided an advance reader copy via NetGalley.",3.0
294,A Very Private School: A Memoir,Memoir,"A Very Private School offers a clear-eyed, first-hand account of a culture of cruelty at the school Charles Spencer attended in his youth and provides important insights into an antiquated boarding system. Drawing on the memories of many of his schoolboy contemporaries, as well as his own letters and diaries from the time, he reflects on the hopelessness and abandonment he felt at aged eight, viscerally describing the intense pain of homesickness and the appalling inescapability of it all. Exploring the long-lasting impact of his experiences, Spencer presents a candid reckoning with his past and a reclamation of his childhood.","I've long been fascinated by the nature of evil. It seems that evil can be tackled only when humans understand its deceptiveness. One truism is that evil is often to be found hidden beneath convincing veneers of caring authority. It's one of the best covers that exists. And what is more evil than destroying and crushing a vulnerable child? Charles Spencer (otherwise known as Earl Spencer) offers a searing, uncompromising account of some highly formative years spent at a boarding prep school, Maidwell Hall, in England in the 1970s. The traditional tendency of the upper classes in England to send their children to such boarding schools at ridiculously young ages is well known. Less well known is the fact that these students were often subjected to the same sadistic brutality that seemed to be accepted in many educational institutions up until at least the early 1980s (in Ireland also). Although I prefer reading paper books, as I find audiobooks fairly hit and miss, I suspected the quality of the narration would be high in this case, as it was the author reading. He has been known for strong, powerful delivery of uncomfortable truths since his eulogy at his sister Princess Diana's funeral many years ago, which somehow managed to be full of righteous anger and dignified at the same time. Similar could be said of this book.Spencer doesn't shy away from providing disturbing details of the sadism and perversions of some staff at Maidwell, as well as the horrendous life-long emotional impact it had on the students as they went on in life. I've always admired his commitment to staring reality in the face, but this takes things to a whole new level. It starts a conversation that is probably long overdue in England about children's emotional welfare and how boarding schools affect their relationships and ability to be intimate in later life. The details of this book are disturbing in the extreme, with Spencer himself going into a lot of depth about the assistant matron who predated on himself and other boys in her charge, causing them extreme confusion and essentially stealing an important part of their childhood. Details about the school's headmaster are highly unsettling, and it's clear he was a predator also, who was clever at disguising this fact to parents with jaunty school reports. Parents were regularly deceived into thinking he was a genial man with humorous insights about their children, and that he cared deeply about their welfare. Spencer, on the other hand, describes how men still had visible stripes from vicious canings well into mid-life, not to mention the psychological scars to accompany them.The book also describes the obligatory violent teacher who hates the boys because of his class hangups about their upper-class backgrounds. It's a stark reminder of the fact that child abuse is no respecter of social rank. Abusers will find their interal excuses one way or another to defend the indefensible.This is a depressing, sorry tale on one level. However, it also offers a huge spark of hope for the future of education and therefore humanity generally. It's not a book that can be ignored by the establishment, given who wrote it, and what it must have taken emotionally to put the words on paper so powerfully. The interviews with other Maidwell students from that time are equally poignant and often heartbreaking, with some men's lives irretrievably ruined due to their time in the school. This book is an impressive achievement on the part of Charles Spencer, a person who has had more than his fair share of upheaval and loss. He has gifted the world with difficult truths more than once, and everyone should thank him for this unflinching courage.",5.0
295,Waiting for the Monsoon,Memoir,"In the tradition of When Breath Becomes Air,  the New York Times's legendary war correspondent delivers his unforgettable final dispatch: a deeply moving meditation on life inspired by his sudden battle with terminal brain cancer.Rod Nordland shadowed death for thirty years as one of his generation's preeminent war correspondents, include posts as bureau chief in Kabul and Baghdad. Then on July 5, 2019, he collapsed in the middle of a morning jog in Delhi's beautiful Lodhi Gardens. He was taken to the local hospital, where doctors diagnosed a brain tumor that turned out to be terminal cancer.Confined to a hospital bed after so many vagabond years spent chasing the next conflict across the globe, Nordland discovered a curious side effect: he was gifted the chance to stop, reflect, and reconnect with those he loved but had been apart from for decades.In the months that passed after his stint in the hospital, he no longer flinched at love and intimacy but exalted in its balm and power. He and his children made peace and enjoyed a closeness he had once thought impossible. He repaired a friendship broken twenty years earlier after decades as the best of friends. Gone was the old arrogance, the certitude that dominated his every action, the combination of which--overweening arrogance and self-confidence--likely helped make him a successful foreign correspondent but denied him the opportunity of becoming so much more.Nordland writes, ""Friends and family members and editors have often raised their eyebrows at my frequent assertions that my tumor was the best thing that ever happened to me, a gift that has enriched my life ever since.""Nordland's account of those first days in the hospital, published in the New York Times two months after his diagnosis, was widely shared and praised by readers for its honesty and beautiful writing. Now he expands on this piece, sharing the lessons he's learned over the last few years. Deeply moving and inspiring, Waiting for the Monsoon is a remarkable story about the human capacity to persevere even in the most difficult of times.","A foreign correspondent, diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, looks back at a remarkable life of overcoming adversity and reporting from war zones. Nordland has already outlived his surgeon's prognosis by more than three years, taking advantage of what he calls his ""Second Life"" to cultivate gratitude and healthy habits, and, of course, to write this. Growing up in poverty with a physically abusive father encouraged self-sufficiency. Much of the book is given over to stories from the field. Nordland thrived on excitement, and conveys the thrill and danger to readers. Part II, ""After the Monsoon,"" marks an inevitable change of pace as the author considers the setbacks of the past few years. Overall, I was more interested in his upbringing and cancer journey than in his wartime experience, but others will feel differently. By virtually anyone's standards, though, he has lived a fascinating life, full of hardship but consistently hopeful. (More of a 3.5, really.)See my full review at BookBrowse.

Determined to break the cycle of being “a statistic,” she knew that even though her parents couldn’t stay, there was no way she could let go of the opportunities the U.S. could provide.Armed with only her passport and sheer teenage determination, Elizabeth became what her school would eventually describe as an unaccompanied, homeless youth, one of thousands of underage victims affected by family separation due to broken immigration laws. For fans of Educated by Tara Westover and The Distance Between Us by Reyna Grande, My Side of the River explores separation, generational trauma, and the toll of the American dream. It’s also, at its core, a love story between a brother and a sister who, no matter the cost, is determined to make the pursuit of his own dreams easier than it was for her.","Should anyone in their twenties write a memoir? My Side of the River is my latest attempt at reading one, and I ultimately concluded that this author should have waited. While Camarillo Gutierrez has a compelling life story to date, there needs to be more substance, self-reflection, and maturity to constitute a memoir. Reading her book, I felt it was another box checked by the author as she plans a political career. Much of the narrative chronologically accounts for the author's day-to-day activities - TMI. I kept waiting for some tension to develop, but the moment never arrived. I wasn't very excited about picking it up, and I was going to DNF it, but I decided to read the book as an anthropologic observation of a GenZ coming of age - then I enjoyed it more.This said I have a strong interest in Elizabeth's story. An undocumented young man joined my family in 9th grade when he had a family crisis not unlike Elizabeth's. So I get it. But what does the author want us to take away from her book? There are no policy recommendations, no recommendations on how we could help children like her, and no way forward.

298,Troubled,Memoir,"In this raw coming-of-age memoir, in the vein of The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, The Other Wes Moore, and Someone Has Led This Child to Believe, Rob Henderson vividly recounts growing up in foster care, enlisting in the US Air Force, attending elite universities, and pioneering the concept of “luxury beliefs”—ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while inflicting costs on the less fortunate.Rob Henderson was born to a drug-addicted mother and a father he never met, ultimately shuttling between ten different foster homes in California. When he was adopted into a loving family, he hoped that life would finally be stable and safe. Divorce, tragedy, poverty, and violence marked his adolescent and teen years, propelling Henderson to join the military upon completing high school.An unflinching portrait of shattered families, desperation, and determination, Troubled recounts Henderson’s expectation-defying young life and juxtaposes his story with those of his friends who wound up incarcerated or killed. He retreads the steps and missteps he took to escape the drama and disorder of his youth. As he navigates the peaks and valleys of social class, Henderson finds that he remains on the outside looking in. His greatest achievements—a military career, an undergraduate education from Yale, a PhD from Cambridge—feel like hollow measures of success. He argues that stability at home is more important than external accomplishments, and he illustrates the ways the most privileged among us benefit from a set of social standards that actively harm the most vulnerable.","Troubled, the part memoir, part manifesto from Rob Henderson is a fascinatingly structured book, softening the reader up with two hundred pages about his undeniably harrowing childhood and adolescence, adding some reasonable analysis of the importance of children growing up in stable, loving family units, before hammering them with his half-baked hypothesis about class. Each chapter is written from the perspective of Henderson at a different ages, from very young childhood to late twenties, and the author makes it clear from the outset that he will leave the analysis and reflection to the later chapters because this is the point at which he had the distance, knowledge and understanding to reflect on what had happened to him and what his experiences represented for society more broadly. His story of being shuttled between overcrowded foster homes, and then of the series of misfortunes that befell him after being adopted, is both heartwrenching and compelling. Henderson's points about the importance of firm boundaries, high expectations and secure attachment are eminently sensible and backed by not only anecdotes from his own life and his friends' lives but by comprehensive research. The main theme which underpins Henderson’s recollections of his early life is family, and the importance of stability and security to children growing up. He rallies against schemes aimed at helping young people from disadvantaged communities get into college, for example, citing considerable research suggesting that educational opportunities cannot make up for a chaotic homelife. However, while he is very clear on what is not helping these children to be happy and fulfilled, he fails to posit any solutions to what he believes is the biggest problem afflicting poor Americans.Henderson makes interesting observations about 'trickle-down meritocracy' at top universities, whereby positive discrimination policies have been put in place to address the lack of diversity (racial and economic) in the hope that the advantages these chosen members of a community accrue will ultimately benefit their whole community. But then, seemingly without irony, he writes that, 'Representation certainly benefits a handful of people who are chosen to enter elite spaces, but it doesn't seem to improve the lives of the dispossessed. In fact, it might backfire. Elite institutions strip-mine talented people out of their communities. Upon completing their education, most of these graduates do not return to their old neighborhoods. Instead, they relocate to a handful of cities where they live alongside their highly educated peers, eroding the bonds of solidarity they had with those they left behind. And who could blame them? It is reasonable to use your talents to advance your career and financial prospects. But if the original intent was to help languishing communities, then this particular solution is failing.' It is unclear how he squares this belief with the hope that children will be inspired by his story, which can only be heard because he wae selected for these opportunities.  I had not read Henderson’s 2018 New York Times op-ed Luxury beliefs are the latest status symbol for rich Americans prior to beginning Troubled - possibly because, to paraphrase Henderson, I don't have 'the kind of job that allows you to browse Twitter' or affords you the time to 'stay current on the proper way to think about social issues.' Thus, I came into Henderson’s book under-prepared: I expected a memoir but wasn't ready for the proselytising. Henderson’s theory about luxury beliefs evolved from Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), his angle being that in the 21st century, rather than indulging in frivolous, economically unproductive hobbies such as golf or beagling, the upper class fritters their time away thinking about the irrelevance of religion, cultural appropriation, and the legalisation of drugs, amongst other ideas which ordinary people cannot spare a thought for because 'they have real problems to worry about.'According to Henderson, the only reason why anyone would hold these beliefs is to show off their class and education to their peers, just as one might flaunt a designer handbag or expensive car. Somehow, he is able to categorically know that no one has come to these conclusions through their own research, or that they truly understand the stances they are endorsing. Henderson glibly muses that, 'Maybe the luxury belief class is ignorant of the realities of who is most harmed by crime. Or perhaps they don't care that the poor will become even more victimized than they already are.' And yet, a cursory amount of reading would reveal that the American War on Drugs, to use an example of a policy counter to one of Henderson’s luxury beliefs, is responsible for swollen prison populations, single parent families and millions of families ruined by addiction. This is just one example of Henderson’s argument seeming under-researched and flawed. He just isn't that informed about some of the issues that are central to his hypothesis, he makes lazy presumptions about the net benefit of ideas he supports, and his ignorance only serves to patronise those whom he purports to speak for. Henderson’s theory is littered with contradictions; it is painfully ironic that the people who would have the time to read his op-ed, his newsletter and his book, and to ruminate on his ideas, are the very same  people he decries. At the time of writing, he has spent time in poor working class communities, in the United States Air Force, and at some of the world's top academic enclaves. How does he know what 'ordinary' people believe about these issues? The rigour of his research into the role of the family has been replaced by anecdotal evidence camouflaged by statistics, and, while I do not dispute that he observed a correlation between students from specific backgrounds subscribing to specific views, this does not prove causation. Indeed, if Henderson were to spend time in a town with similar deprivation markers to his adopted hometown of Red Bluff, but with a predominantly Black population, he would likely find support for the idea of police reform. Furthermore, in having the time to conjecture on his ideas whilst pursuing a PhD at Cambridge University, has Henderson himself not become one of the elites he so despises? Georges Prat, a Canadian criminal lawyer, writing for Medium in 2021, had this to say of Henderson’s hypothesis:If I were to guess, I’d say Henderson is simply a highly conservative person who arrived at university and hadn’t been in touch with left-wing woke politics prior to that. He had a strong sense of certainty in his own views, so when he encountered opposing views, he didn’t even bother entertaining them to evaluate their merits. Instead, he dismissed them as nonsense. After that, he had to find a way to reconcile the apparent intelligence of his peers with the “nonsense” views they held... One gets the sense he feels so certain in the correctness of his conservative views that he came up with a way to explain away the opposing views held by his university peers, i.e. “they only believe that because they’re affluent status seekers displaying their luxury beliefs as a way to move up the social hierarchy. Obviously the ideas themselves have no merit.'It is a shame that Henderson chose to conclude his book with his soap-boxing, as the rest of the book is moving and rousing. Thank you to NetGalley and Swift Press for the opportunity to read and review an ARC of this book.",3.0
299,Splinters,Memoir,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Recovering and The Empathy Exams comes the riveting story of rebuilding a life after the end of a marriage—an exploration of motherhood, art, and new love. Leslie Jamison has become one of our most beloved contemporary voices, a scribe of the real, the true, the complex. She has been compared to Joan Didion and Susan Sontag, acclaimed for her powerful thinking, deep feeling, and electric prose. But while Jamison has never shied away from challenging material—scouring her own psyche and digging into our most unanswerable questions across four books— Splinters enters a new realm. In her first memoir, Jamison turns her unrivaled powers of perception on some of the most intimate relationships of her her consuming love for her young daughter, a ruptured marriage once swollen with hope, and the shaping legacy of her own parents’ complicated bond. In examining what it means for a woman to be many things at once—a mother, an artist, a teacher, a lover—Jamison places the magical and the mundane side by side in surprising ways: pumping breastmilk in a shared university office, driving the open highway in the throes of new love, growing a tender second skin of consciousness as she watches her daughter come alive to the world. The result is a work of nonfiction like no other, an almost impossibly deep reckoning with the muchness of life and art, and a book that grieves the departure of one love even as it celebrates the arrival of another. How do we move forward into joy when we are haunted by loss? How do we claim hope alongside the harm we’ve caused? A memoir for which the very term tour de force seems to have been coined, Splinters plumbs these and other pressing questions with writing that is revelatory to the last page. Jamison has delivered a book with the linguistic daring and emotional acuity that made The Empathy Exams and The Recovering instant classics, even as she reaches new depths of understanding, piercing the reader to the core. A master of nonfiction, she evinces once again her ability to “stitch together the intellectual and the emotional with the finesse of a crackerjack surgeon” (NPR).",Jamison writes beautifully and brings a depth of wisdom to her prose I really admire. As a memoir of motherhood and divorce there is a lot going on here. Very introspective. The parts about always trying to make yourself into what romantic interests want you to be is relatable. The overall pace and balance of the book felt off. An engrossing read overall.,4.0
300,Burn Book: A Tech Love Story,Nonfiction,"Part memoir, part history, Burn Book is a necessary chronicle of tech’s most powerful players. This is the inside story we’ve all been waiting for about modern Silicon Valley and the biggest boom in wealth creation in the history of the world.When tech titans crowed that they would “move fast and break things,” Kara Swisher was moving faster and breaking news. While covering the explosion of the digital sector in the early 1990s, she developed a long track record of digging up and reporting the facts about this new world order. Her consistent scoops drove one CEO to accuse her of “listening in the heating ducts” and prompted Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg to once observe: “It is a constant joke in the Valley when people write memos for them to say, ‘I hope Kara never sees this.’”While still in college, Swisher got her start at The Washington Post, where she became one of the few people in journalism interested in covering the nascent Internet. She went on to work for The Wall Street Journal, joining with Walt Mossberg to start the groundbreaking D: All Things Digital conference, as well as pioneering tech news sites.Swisher has interviewed everyone who matters in tech over three decades, right when they presided over an explosion of world-changing innovation that has both helped and hurt our world. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Iger, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meg Whitman, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are just a few whom Swisher made sweat—figuratively and, in Zuckerberg’s case, literally.Despite the damage she chronicles, Swisher remains optimistic about tech’s potential to help solve problems and not just create them. She calls upon the industry to make better, more thoughtful choices, even as a new set of powerful AI tools are poised to change the world yet again. At its heart, this book is a love story to, for, and about tech from someone who knows it better than anyone.","18th book for 2024. Audiobook—Author ReadingWhen I was a psychology undergraduate at university in Australia in the early 1990s I was given access to the university VAX computers as part of our compulsory statistics course. This was still a time when typing up an essay, with errors corrected in tippex was seen as fancy, most students still handwrote course assignments, and most professors still hadn't learnt of email, and HTML was a few years away. What my professor didn't know was that having a VAX account came along with Internet access and when I realized this I went wild. Suddenly I had access to email and Usenet discussion groups. On a backgammon group I suggested we stop talking about games and actually play them, and so ended up running the first International BG tournament through my statistics account—non-trivial as email was the sole form of communication for players (how do you show a board? how do you roll dice in a way that players see as fair?). My professor commended me for being so hard working as my time online was audited.It's clear from her account that Swisher got the Internet as I did, and took the jump, leaving a golden path to politics reporter at the Washington Post to the (then) very niche job of tech reporter on the West Coast. She was there at the beginning and broke many key stories on Silicon Valley as it developed, and in the process becoming a Silicon Valley icon herself.So this book should have been a easy win for me. However, it turned out to be a vapid nothingburger. The book is made up of chapters where Swisher mostly bashes Internet founders as narcissistic white man children—something I can get behind—but her analysis is so shallow it basically exists at the level of name calling. The Google Founders are labelled the weird twins and criticised in a mild way for ripping off intellectual property. Mark Zuckerberg is apparently still a teenage arsehole that sweats a lot when he's nervous. Bezos is super ambitious and given a star for getting internet delivery sorted out—but is also an arsehole. Musk was apparently a great guy until he bought Twitter and ruined it for Swisher (what about all the shitty things he did before then with Tesla??). Steve Jobs was an arsehole, but a visionary and so he gets a pass. Nothing she says is interesting or deep or new here. The other chapters are a sort of Wikipedia style summary of her life. She got a job here, she dated so and so, married someone else, had a child, started this business or that business. None of it is anywhere deep or personal enough to be of much interest. Most of this seems to be either to puff-up her self worth or aid in her slagging off of this or that boss from decades past. She also has this annoying habit of constantly talking about how ""tough"" she is, how ""mean but fair"" she is. Isn't that what any decent journalist is? The only thing I'll take from the book is Sergey Brin's baby shower in 2008, where the rich and famous attendees were forced to choose between wearing nappies or onesies, and could drink expensive vodka dripping from an ice statue's nipple. Normally I don't give one-stars, as I usually abandon these sorts of books before the end, but since I finished this one I'll rate it.1-star.",1.0
301,This American Ex-Wife: How I Ended My Marriage and Started My Life,Nonfiction,"A deeply validating manifesto on the gender politics of marriage (bad) and divorce (actually pretty good!) in America today, and an argument that the former needs a reboot—from journalist and proud divorcée Lyz LenzStudies show that nearly 70 percent of divorces are initiated by women—women who are tired, fed up, exhausted, and unhappy. Lyz is one such woman whose life fell apart after she reached a breaking point in her twelve-year marriage. In this exuberant and unapologetic book, Lyz Lenz is flipping the script on that narrative and preaching the good gospel of the power of divorce.The end of a marriage is often seen as the failure of the individual—most often, the woman. We've all seen how the media portrays divorced sad, lonely, drowning their sorrows in a bottle of wine, desperate for a new man. It’s as though they did something wrong, so they’ve been cast out from society. Lyz sees divorce as a practical and powerful solution for women to take back the power they are owed, while examining why we call divorce a failure, when it's heterosexual marriage that has been flawed all along. How can women succeed in marriage when our relationships are based on inequality?This book weaves reportage with sociological research, literature with popular culture, and personal stories of coming together and breaking up to create a kaleidoscopic and poignant portrait of American marriage today. Lyz argues that the mechanisms of American power, justice, love, and gender equality remain deeply flawed, and that marriage, like any other cultural institution, is due for a reckoning. Unlike any other book about divorce, this raucous manifesto for acceptance, solidarity, and collective female refusal takes readers on a riveting ride—all while pointing us all toward something a little more free.","This had a lot of the same problems as Lenz's two previous books but now that we're on book #3 I'm frankly out of patience. This is similar to a lot of contemporary nonfiction these days in that it blends memoir with social commentary in an attempt to tie the author's own experience to a larger narrative but it fails badly due in part to the fact that Lenz isn't a strong enough writer to pull it all together and in part because she seems either unaware or unwilling to acknowledge her experience is not the typical 2020s heterosexual marriage. Lenz was the homeschooled daughter of evangelical conservatives and her marriage dynamics could have come straight from the 1950s (at one point she mentions packing her husband lunch's every day for years). As glad as I am Lenz is no longer living a life she clearly felt suffocated by, I was frustrated by how broad a brush she painted with. I wish she had followed a similar vein as other ex-evangelical women who have written heartbreaking and powerful memoirs in recent years detailing how badly the promises of Christian patriarchy fail women (Shannon Harris' 'The Woman They Wanted' is a recent example) because Lenz clearly has important things to say but her attempt to paint marriage as an overwhelming net negative with little room for nuance in chapter after chapter felt very one-note. None of her criticisms of heterosexual marriage feel particularly groundbreaking if you've had any prior engagement with feminist theory, and some of the data she uses to support her arguments feel cherrypicked. I was also very thrown by this line in a Time Magazine essay  Lenz wrote as part of her book promotion, which is not mentioned in the actual book: ""I knew money would be tight when I left. I didn’t have access to our joint account and had to set up a secret account to save money for a lawyer."" This is not just a description of an unhappy marriage, this is financial abuse. That word--abuse--is to my recollection never included in  This American Ex-Wife . Maybe it should have been.",2.0
302,"Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood",Nonfiction,"This heartfelt and wry career memoir from the director of Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Legends of the Fall, About Last Night, and Glory, creator of the show thirtysomething, and executive producer of My So-Called Life, gives a dishy, behind-the-scenes look at working with some of the biggest names in Hollywood.“I’ll be dropping a few names,” Ed Zwick confesses in the introduction to his book. “Over the years I have worked with self-proclaimed masters-of-the-universe, unheralded geniuses, hacks, sociopaths, savants, and saints.”He has encountered these Hollywood types during four decades of directing, producing, and writing projects that have collectively received eighteen Academy Award nominations (seven wins) and sixty-seven Emmy nominations (twenty-two wins). Though there are many factors behind such success, including luck and the contributions of his creative partner Marshall Herskovitz, he’s known to have a special talent for bringing out the best in the people he’s worked with, especially the actors. In those intense collaborations, he’s sought to discover the small pieces of connective tissue, vulnerability, and fellowship that can help an actor realize their character in full.Talents whom he spotted early include Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Denzel Washington, Claire Danes, and Jared Leto. Established stars he worked closely with include Leonardo DiCaprio, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Daniel Craig, Jake Gyllenhaal, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Jennifer Connelly. He also sued Harvey Weinstein over the production of Shakespeare in Love —and won. He shares personal stories about all these people, and more.Written mostly with love, sometimes with rue, this memoir is also a meditation on working, sprinkled throughout with tips for anyone who has ever imagined writing, directing, or producing for the screen. Fans with an appreciation for the beautiful mysteries—as well as the unsightly, often comic truths—of crafting film and television won’t want to miss it.","Why do we rush to read books from our favorite celebrities? Why do we immerse ourselves in the lives of our favorite actors, singers, writers, filmmakers, and others? While it seems like everyone right now is reading books from Britney Spears or Jada Pinkett-Smith or others, I barely raised an eyebrow when those titles were released and instead my heart went aflutter when I caught sight of ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood"" by Oscar winner Ed Zwick. Filmmakers, it would seem, are loathe to write traditional biographies. Instead, they take the worlds they've spent their lives creating and invite us even deeper into them. I've read a number of memoirs authored by filmmakers over the years, I am a professional film journalist after all, and the vast majority of them have been rather light on personal revelations yet filled to the brim with cinematic nuggets of insight and wisdom. The same is true here. Ed Zwick is the acclaimed director of such films as Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Legends of the Fall, About Last Night, and Glory among others. He created the television show Thirtysomething and executive produced My So-Called Life. He's worked with a number of the film industry's greats, often discovering them or at least empowering them early in their careers, and over four decades in the industry his projects have claimed eighteen Academy Award nominations (seven wins) and sixty-seven Emmy Award nominations (22 wins). He himself claimed the Oscar for producing Shakespeare in Love, a victory made, perhaps, more sweet by his lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, which he won, after Weinstein tried to squeeze him out. ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions"" is, quite simply, one of the best of the many books I've read written by filmmakers. The book is less a personal memoir than a creative one. Chapters are organized primarily by films, projects, or creative periods and while Zwick doesn't avoid personal revelation neither does he immerse us in it. Instead, Zwick invites us into his creative process as he grows as a filmmaker and encounters the ""self-proclaimed masters-of-the-universe, unheralded geniuses, hacks, sociopaths, savants, and saints"" he's worked with over the years. Refreshingly, he doesn't really hold back whether heaping enormous praise or honestly sharing details regarding his most challenging relationships. We learn about the complex and complicated relationship, for example, that he shared with a fresh off Ferris Bueller's Day Off Matthew Broderick during the subsequent shooting of Glory. While he's quick to share that the two have since made amends, the vivid storytelling makes it clear this was among his most difficult relationships during filming. There were others.Throughout ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions,"" there are others where he shares lovingly, ruefully, or even with some degree of existing exasperation as he truly does reflect upon his hits, flops, and other experiences over the years. I found myself loving nearly every page of ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions,"" though I'll confess I found the ending rather abrupt and perhaps lacking the personality that had filled the pages before it. Yet, this is a minor quibble for a book that informed, enlightened, entertained, and widened my view of Zwick and the cinematic worlds he's created over the years. Each chapter also includes what could almost be called a meditation on the work itself, tidbits and insights and teachings often hard-earned and clearly never forgotten. I'm not always sure why I choose to read a book by filmmakers, however, what I do know is that what I long for is exactly what I've gotten from Ed Zwick's ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions."" Written with tremendous heart and humor, honesty and vulnerability, ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions"" is no doubt a must-read for anyone who wants to gain greater knowledge and insight into the creative process and those who commit their lives to entertaining us all.",5.0
303,What Have We Here?: Portraits of a Life,Nonfiction,"A film legend recalls his remarkable life of nearly eight decades—a heralded actor who's played the roles he wanted, from Brian’s Song to Lando in the Star Wars universe—unchecked by the racism and typecasting so rife in the mostly all-white industry in which he triumphed.Billy Dee Williams was born in Harlem in 1937 and grew up in a household of love and sophistication. As a young boy, he made his stage debut working with Lotte Lenya in an Ira Gershwin/Kurt Weill production where Williams ended up feeding Lenya her lines. He studied painting, first at the High School of Music and Art, with fellow student Diahann Carroll, and then at the National Academy of Fine Art, before setting out to pursue acting with Herbert Berghoff, Stella Adler, and Sidney Poitier.His first film role was in The Last Angry Man , the great Paul Muni’s final film. It was Muni who gave Billy the advice that sent him soaring as an actor, “You can play any character you want to play no matter who you are, no matter the way you look or the color of your skin.” And Williams writes, “I wanted to be anyone I wanted to be.”He writes of landing the role of a co-starring alongside James Caan in Brian’s Song , the made-for-television movie that was watched by an audience of more than fifty million people. Williams says it was “the kind of interracial love story America needed.”And when, as the first Black character in the Star Wars universe, he became a true pop culture icon, playing Lando Calrissian in George Lucas’s The Empire Strikes Back (“What I presented on the screen people didn’t expect to see”). It was a role he reprised in the final film of the original trilogy, The Return of the Jedi, and in the recent sequel The Rise of Skywalker.A legendary actor, in his own words, on all that has sustained and carried him through a lifetime of dreams and adventure.","""I have a glass of wine in front of me and am enjoying a warm spring day when I having nothing to do and no place I need to be other than where I am at the moment. Screw the pandemic, the politics, the divisions and name-calling, and the hate that is all we hear about these days."" -- on page 3I was mentioning to a friend the other day that actor Billy Dee Williams has a rare type of crossover appeal - women love him for his suave ladies' man persona (such as his hit '75 flick Mahoghany or a long-running series of Colt .45 commercials); men appreciate him for his part in the classic TV-movie biopic Brian's Song, in which he had memorable chemistry with co-star James Caan; and children (of all ages) recognize him for his swashbuckling role as Lando Calrissian in three of the Star Wars films. Williams' good luck and diligent work ethic but trademark laidback ethos is represented well in his autobio / memoir What Have We Here? - title copped via his smooth introductory dialogue as Lando from way back in 1980 - in which he lovingly details growing up in a nurturing middle-class family in New York City of the 40's and 50's, the struggle of his working actor days throughout the 60's, and the mainstream success he finally achieved in the 70's and 80's. I really enjoyed the many sections on his family - it is apparent that his mother, father, twin sister and grandmother all served as quite the positive and long-lasting influences on him - as well his memories of the various projects that established / solidified his acting credentials. Although it only received a brief mention in the text, I'm glad he referenced his part in the somewhat-forgotten 1983 miniseries Chiefs - based on an early bestseller by Stuart Woods - which is probably my favorite role that he has ever done. As a quietly heroic and recently-appointed police chief in a southern town during the early 60's Civil Rights-era, Williams' character has a great introductory scene in which he stuns the incredulous officers newly under his command with the line ""My name is Tyler Watts . . . but you can call me CHIEF!"" as he slams his badge on the station countertop. Somewhere, Sidney Poitier's Virgil Tibbs is applauding.",4.0
304,I'm Glad My Mom Died,Nonfiction,"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that. Do read this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars",4.0
305,Greenlights,Nonfiction,"I’ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.” So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It’s a love letter. To life. It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck.","A rambling book with great stories but flawed execution. McConaughey was a C student in college, claiming he was normally an A student but wanted to devote time to real world instead of books, and at the end of this books says he'd rather ""take an experienced C over an ignorant A any day."" Well, this book is a C at best and could have been an A if he would have been less self-satisfied and allowed others to guide him to objective conclusions. Instead it's all about subjective Matthew living his life only as he wants.The good parts are very good--he is a gifted storyteller and this is one of the rare Hollywood memoirs that has a lot of great personal stories in it. Most of them occur before he becomes famous, but halfway through the book something changes. He goes from an average guy to a movie star, and that's when the book (and possibly his personal character) starts to fall apart.If you're looking for insights into his movies you won't find any here. He just lists most of them, more interested in his life experiences. He's like a playful pup that doesn't want to be tied down and runs away to avoid being bored. It's fun to read about his decision to drive an RV around the country and his settling in Austin, Texas. I admire his belief in God, his somewhat conservative nature, and his very pro-life stance in wanting children.There are also many negatives. The title and structure of the book are ridiculous. A waste of a misguided concept. He focuses on supposed ""greenlights,"" yet he doesn't define them clearly and claims everything is a greenlight, whether he manipulates a situation or things just happen to him. Then the pages are filled with his scribbling, journal entries, and one-sentence sayings that often make little sense. This guy is very self-involved and while he does say some interesting nuggets you have to dig through all the crap to get to them. Almost nothing about girlfriends, sex, dealing with other performers, and drug use. And at the start he mentions in a list of life experiences being blackmailed to have sex for the first time and being molested by a man at age 18, then he never says anything about it again.McConaughey also paints a very negative picture of his bizarre parents. He talks positively about them but then gives stories of how mean, rude, violent, immoral, and insulting they were. How he is having his mother live with him now is hard to believe--she comes across as a crazed liar who couldn't be trusted, slamming him even more as he became famous.Which brings us to the biggest problem in the book--the author's belief that lying is totally acceptable, as is stealing, backing out of commitments, and using others for personal gain. His parents taught him all that. He calls it ""outlaw"" rules, where the only right and wrong involves getting caught. So he brags about doing many bad things, and only regrets the few times he is caught. This immoral justification of lying and cheating coming from a guy who claims to be living an honest life. He is delusional but appears to have convinced many others who admire his charming ways of getting what he wants.He's quite a character, and the book is very entertaining. But as he gets near the end he skips most of the last seven years of his life, summarizing it into a couple pages. And the conclusions he draws ignore many of the truths that become obvious to an objective reader of the book--that McConaughey doesn't really have any objective truths he holds to and is just making things up as he goes. While I admire his attractive ability to pivot and go with the flow, it's hard to justify his drug use, thoughtlessness, selfishness, and defense of lying. He needed to notice many more redlights in his life and not interpret so many as greenlights.",3.0
306,Untamed,Nonfiction,"Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is.","Audiobook... read by Glennon DoyleMy thoughts and feelings changed ‘several’ times - from positive to negative - back to positive- back to negative!!!By the end.... I was just glad to be DONE! If this book was ‘clearly’ a memoir... I wouldn’t have felt annoyed. I often didn’t buy her strategies in achieving emotional balance—-because ‘she’ lacked balance in important areas of life: true empathy for others.Glennon will ALWAYS put her needs and desires ‘before’ others. She demonstrated several times how she swung that pendulum from being a person who didn’t know how to please herself to no longer pleasing anyone. Glennon’s selfish tone towards others was brutal - rather than unflinching honest. She was down right mean, righteous at times. I began to wonder if Glennon had respect for ‘anyone’ other than herself. Does she realize that many women know who they are? We don’t all judge our value ourselves by the size of thighs? ‘Part’ of being a whole contributing human being is sometimes putting other people’s needs first ( at cause), before our own.Glennon is not there yet....she still needs to ‘prove’ that she’s her own woman goddamnit!! Power to Glennon! This review would make ZERO DIFFERENCE to Glennon. She said herself, she doesn’t give a rats ass about my opinion - or what I think of her, anyway. So how do people contribute ‘back’ to her? Where is her opening to ‘hearing’ that there might be a reason some of us readers ‘might’ (the Glennon sin?), feel she has a few things to still learn about the balance between being who we are - without verbally purging righteousness onto others. Glennon clearly’ states she only cares about herself - over and over and over again.Yes... this is a happy world with Glennon’s savvy wisdom.She transferred one disorder… (over-eating, purging, over drinking, trouble with the law,), to a self serving shaming-others for not being like ‘her’. PARTS WERE GOOD - in the beginning - until she chewed the human race to threads! Her self righteous me me me - ME FIRST - no-pleasing others rule became annoying. I lost total respect!!!I appreciated a few chapters in this book... I liked her ‘own’ discovery about parenting - and where she went south in giving her son the message that his life (studying for school, tests the next day, etc.), were more important than his responsibility as a contributing member to the family. After Glendon’s realization- that she was raising a self- centered - self serving kid- she made corrections. She began to demand his respect and contributions to the family. Now her kid did the dishes after dinner -(she made the meal after all). Glennon’s ‘a-ha’ moments of parenting ‘discoveries’ ....that raising a privileged son wasn’t doing him any long term service, was admirable. I had much respect for Glennon’s ‘moral’ discovery—I wished I had made that discovery myself when I was raising our daughters, myself. I ‘allowed’ our daughters to do their homework ( skip dishes) because why? because their life wellness out in ‘their’ world was more important than them ‘contributing’ to ‘our’ family. I did the fricken dishes -I made the meals -I did the cleaning - Paul supported our family financially. Hell - I made their lunches - drove them to their many activities every single day - ( private independent schools, music lessons, sports, dance, theater, Hebrew school, etc) I was their slave and I was wrong!!! I never taught them to sincerely value and respect Paul and I. Guess what? Both daughters are successful in the world and independent - but only one of them respects Paul and I fully and expresses it.So... I felt that Glendon did have some very valuable insights into the role of parenting. But...I never got the impression that she respected her ownparents. She patted herself on the back about how great she was. So... I thought Glennon shared some useful tips about parenting from morality rather than kids accomplishments in the outside world.However, every time Glennon moved away from ‘sharing’ her experiences -and started preaching her views - I lost total respect for her. Glennon is ‘not’ a talented compassionate INSPIRATIONAL or SPIRITUAL leader...Her lack of empathy and appropriate speaking skills fell apart. I spent a couple of days trying to figure out what it was that she did that DROVE ME NUTS....She was self serving and annoying in her ME FIRST Philosophy. Too much swinging-that pendulum with her good girl/ bad girl themes. ...Glennon is a recovered alcoholic-...A recovered bulimic-...A girl who had destroyed all her relationships at one time as well.I’m happy Glennon found her own voice - and did some repair work - learned to look inward at her own needs and desires - rather than self harm herself. BUT...I was incredibly embarrassed by many things she said - and the tone in which she said them. Even her words about being a feminist were cringe-shaking off the wall. RIGHTEOUS is as RIGHTEOUS is!!! ( yuck)It was her ASSUMPTION that most woman were just like her - Only focusing on makeup-clothes- getting others to love ‘us’... Glennon Doyle crossed the line into PUSHING HER RIGHTEOUSNESS on others. One minute she talked about nurturing relationships and the next minute she slammed any person who called her on the telephone or sent her a text message for the gall of interrupting her life. My God then she compared the last presidential race to the apocalypse. What the hell? I think this is the last book I ever plan to read by Glennon Doyle.She’s not Eckhart Tolle, Brené Brown, Lama Surya Das, or Don Miguel Ruiz....This is a MEMOIR — that bordered closely to PREACHING! Glennon Doyle is a woman who took many years to find her own voice.... years of healing from self harm - harming others as well. She still has a few loose marbles about the totality of humanity.....I don’t want to live inside her ‘ME FIRST’ bubble. There are many shades of gray. Life is not all black or white - as Glennon would have us to believe. She was down right mean to people who asked her questions. Glennon Doyle is not a person I trust to teach me HOW TO BE A POWERFUL WOMEN!2.5 stars - rating down.",2.0
307,Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,Nonfiction,"From internationally renowned writer and Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, a searing, deeply personal account of enduring—and surviving—an attempt on his life thirty years after the fatwa that was ordered against him On the morning of August 12, 2022, Salman Rushdie was standing onstage at the Chautauqua Institution, preparing to give a lecture on the importance of keeping writers safe from harm, when a man in black—black clothes, black mask—rushed down the aisle toward him, wielding a knife. His first thought: So it’s you. Here you are.What followed was a horrific act of violence that shook the literary world and beyond. Now, for the first time, and in unforgettable detail, Rushdie relives the traumatic events of that day and its aftermath, as well as his journey toward physical recovery and the healing that was made possible by the love and support of his wife, Eliza, his family, his army of doctors and physical therapists, and his community of readers worldwide.Knife is Rushdie at the peak of his powers, writing with urgency, with gravity, with unflinching honesty. It is also a deeply moving reminder of literature’s capacity to make sense of the unthinkable, an intimate and life-affirming meditation on life, loss, love, art—and finding the strength to stand up again.","A must read Words can't be destroyed in a healthy society. As long as they hold meaning for people, books are indestructible, especially in the digital age. Unfortunately, humans are more fragile, and authors become targets for dangerous extremists who cannot accept another opinion.Salman Rushdie is a powerful man. He not only survived an attempted murder but also decades of attacks and restrictions.'Knife' talks about all that in a profound and meaningful way. It is a rare non-fiction book written by one of the greatest contemporary fiction writers. It shows a courageous man who, despite all the hate he received, still found a way to live a happy and fulfilled life.",5.0
308,A Promised Land,Nonfiction,"A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making, from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy. In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation’s highest office.Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.","Our expectations for elected officials aren’t always very realistic, and none more than for those elected to the highest office in our country. We’ve never had a perfect President and never will, but there are certain qualities that I believe are essential. Intelligence, a respect for the office and more importantly a reverence for our democracy, a strong sense of responsibility for protecting our nation and its citizens, leadership skills that bring together qualified people in the government, a recognition that we have a role to play as citizens of the world, to name a few. Former President Barack Obama was not a perfect President, but I believe that he embodied all of these things that I expect in a President and I believe that even more now, after listening to this book.No matter what you think about Barack Obama, the man can write! It’s illustrated in this first volume of his memoir, as well as the other books he’s written. There are beautiful descriptions of walking along the promenade from the White House residence to the West Wing, the Rose Garden, the Oval Office, intimate descriptions of his family life, his love for his wife and daughters, his love for his deceased mother and grandparents. My favorite introspective passage is the following quote which I played over and over to be sure I got the words right, but also because they represent in such a meaningful way how he viewed his enormous responsibility. “ I would never fully rid myself of the sense of reverence I felt when ever I walked Into the Oval Office, the feeling that I entered not an office, but a sanctum of democracy. Day after day it like comforted and fortified me reminding me of the privilege of my burdens and my duties. “My favorite parts of the book were early on when he talked about making the decision to run and the stories of the campaign were just so fascinating, funny at times and so informative. Michelle asked him just before he announced that he would run , “Why you?” Obama responded that if he became President, “the world would look at America differently, that kids , Black and Hispanic or kids who don’t fit in will see themselves differently, their horizons lifted, their possibilities expanded .” I enjoyed so much hearing about the grass roots campaign, using the internet, how the field organizers in Iowa worked was just fascinating. With love and respect, he tells of his relationships with David Axelrod, Robert Gibbs, the young Reggie Love and David Pfluffe, who Obama thought was so brilliant that he became his Campaign Manager and so many others. I loved hearing the origins of “Fired up ! Ready to Go ! “ Always prepared, he wrote both a concession and acceptance speech.” The book is also laden with dense discussions on the economic crisis the country was facing when he took office, his first G20 conference, foreign policy, health care and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the war in Afghanistan. I have to admit that there were some chapters where I sped up the audio, but for anyone who is a policy wonk, these might be more interesting. These chapters, though, reflect the complexity of the issues before him and the country at this time. They also reflect the intelligent, pragmatic yet caring ways he approached things.Barack Obama always felt the weight of the office and the responsibility to protect the nation, the huge responsibility of being Commander in Chief, the casualties of troops in Afghanistan, writing letters to their families. He read security briefings every morning, and then had meetings with security staff right after - imagine that ! (Couldn’t help myself.) This narrative reflects part of his first term and I can’t wait for the second volume. I love this man . I cried when he won in 2008, a good, heartfelt cry and I cried when his second term was over, a sad and horrified cry. ( Again , I couldn’t help myself.) I have missed him every single day since January 20, 2017. Clearly, I’m biased so you might want to read it yourself, and I do highly recommend it .",5.0
309,Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard,Nonfiction,"Tom Felton’s adolescence was anything but ordinary. His early rise to fame in beloved films like 
The Borrowers 
catapulted him into the limelight, but nothing could prepare him for what was to come after he landed the iconic role of the Draco Malfoy, the bleached blonde villain of the 
Harry Potter
 movies. For the next ten years, he was at the center of a huge pop culture phenomenon and yet, in between filming, he would go back to being a normal teenager trying to fit into a normal school.  Speaking with great candor and his signature humor, Tom shares his experience growing up as part of the wizarding world while also trying to navigate the muggle world. He tells stories from his early days in the business like his first acting gig where he was mistaken for fellow blonde child actor Macaulay Culkin and his 
Harry Potter
 audition where, in a very Draco-like move, he fudged how well he knew the books the series was based on (not at all). He reflects on his experiences working with cinematic greats such as Alan Rickman, Sir Michael Gambon, Dame Maggie Smith, and Ralph Fiennes (including that awkward Voldemort hug). And, perhaps most poignantly, he discusses the lasting relationships he made over that decade of filming, including with Emma Watson, who started out as a pesky nine-year-old whom he mocked for not knowing what a boom mic was but who soon grew into one of his dearest friends. Then, of course, there are the highs and lows of fame and navigating life after such a momentous and life-changing experience. Tom Felton’s 
Beyond the Wand
 is an entertaining, funny, and poignant must-read for any 
Harry Potter
 fan. Prepare to meet a real-life wizard.",I think I'm a little in love with Tom Felton. I had this on audio and it was brilliant. The insights into Tom's world when filming the Harry Potter movies and some of his other movies was really cool. I appreciated how honest he was about some of his problems. His voice was magnificent and really captured that raw emotion. Loved it!,5.0
310,The House of Hidden Meanings,Memoir,"From international drag superstar and pop culture icon RuPaul, comes his most revealing and personal work to date—a brutally honest, surprisingly poignant, and deeply intimate memoir of growing up Black, poor, and queer in a broken home to discovering the power of performance, found family, and self-acceptance. A profound introspection of his life, relationships, and identity,  The House of Hidden Meanings  is a self-portrait of the legendary icon on the road to global fame and changing the way the world thinks about drag. Central to RuPaul’s success has been his chameleonic adaptability. From drag icon to powerhouse producer of one of the world’s largest television franchises, RuPaul’s ever-shifting nature has always been part of his brand as both supermodel and supermogul. Yet that adaptability has made him enigmatic to the public. In this memoir, his most intimate and detailed book yet, RuPaul makes himself truly known. Stripping away all artifice, RuPaul recounts the story of his life with breathtaking clarity and tenderness, bringing his signature wisdom and wit to his own biography. From his early years growing up as a queer Black kid in San Diego navigating complex relationships with his absent father and temperamental mother, to forging an identity in the punk and drag scenes of Atlanta and New York, to finding enduring love with his husband Georges LeBar and self-acceptance in sobriety, RuPaul excavates his own biography, uncovering new truths and insights in his personal history. Here in RuPaul’s singular and extraordinary story is a manual for living—a personal philosophy that testifies to the value of chosen family, the importance of harnessing what makes you different, and the transformational power of facing yourself fearlessly. If we’re all born naked and the rest is drag, then this is RuPaul totally out of drag. This is RuPaul stripped bare.","Don't go into 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗘 𝗢𝗙 𝗛𝗜𝗗𝗗𝗘𝗡 𝗠𝗘𝗔𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦 looking for celebrity dirt (although there is one telling story about Madonna). Instead, RuPaul uses this memoir to reflect on his dysfunctional upbringing and the battles he fought to not only to become a star, but just to survive.Listening to him tell his story, it's not the hyped up, over-the-top superstar you see on Drag Race. This is the vulnerable and scarred queer black boy who grew up in the South. He stresses the importance of taking what makes you different and finding a way to making it your superpower, and also how much of a role self-belief plays in finding your way. Ru had to reinvent himself over and over in order to achieve what he has, and there's a lesson in that for all of us - it's never too late to start again.",4.0
311,Rebel Rising: A Memoir,Memoir,"For decades, Rebel Wilson had single-mindedly focused on her career, making a name for herself through her iconic roles in Pitch Perfect, Bridesmaids, and Isn’t It Romantic. Now, she’s ready to chronicle the emotional and physical lessons she learned, as well as her most embarrassing experiences. A malaria-induced hallucination? An all-style martial arts fighting tournament? Junior handling at dog shows? And this was all BEFORE she moved to Hollywood!Rebel Rising follows Rebel Wilson’s incredible journey of “making it,” constantly questioning, “Am I good enough? Will I ever find love? Will I ever change and become healthy?” Rebel writes for the first time about the most personal and important moments in her life—from fertility issues, weight gain and loss, sexuality, overcoming shyness, rejections, and, well...okay there’s at least one story thrown in about Brad Pitt! It’s all here. This memoir shows us how to love ourselves while making us laugh uncontrollably.","I've seen several Rebel Wilson films Bridesmaids, How to be Single, all 3 Pitch Perfect films but I wouldn't say I'm a fan. I don't think much about her or her personal life but I heard that she thinks Sasha Baron Cohen is an asshole and I've always thought he was a asshole so why not read her book. I'm not sure how I feel about this book. Rebel Wilson has had an interesting life but her book is kinda boring. I don't know how to describe it but I just didn't feel anything while reading this. I think Rebel is a nice person and I'd probably like her if we met in real life but she's just not a very compelling writer( I'm sure she probably had a ghost writer but still). I know lots of people don't rate Memoirs because they don't want to rate someone's life but I do because they put a price on their life. They got paid to write their book and they charge money to buy it....so I'm giving this book 2.5 Stars.",2.0
312,Burn Book: A Tech Love Story,Nonfiction,"Part memoir, part history, Burn Book is a necessary chronicle of tech’s most powerful players. This is the inside story we’ve all been waiting for about modern Silicon Valley and the biggest boom in wealth creation in the history of the world.When tech titans crowed that they would “move fast and break things,” Kara Swisher was moving faster and breaking news. While covering the explosion of the digital sector in the early 1990s, she developed a long track record of digging up and reporting the facts about this new world order. Her consistent scoops drove one CEO to accuse her of “listening in the heating ducts” and prompted Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg to once observe: “It is a constant joke in the Valley when people write memos for them to say, ‘I hope Kara never sees this.’”While still in college, Swisher got her start at The Washington Post, where she became one of the few people in journalism interested in covering the nascent Internet. She went on to work for The Wall Street Journal, joining with Walt Mossberg to start the groundbreaking D: All Things Digital conference, as well as pioneering tech news sites.Swisher has interviewed everyone who matters in tech over three decades, right when they presided over an explosion of world-changing innovation that has both helped and hurt our world. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Iger, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meg Whitman, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are just a few whom Swisher made sweat—figuratively and, in Zuckerberg’s case, literally.Despite the damage she chronicles, Swisher remains optimistic about tech’s potential to help solve problems and not just create them. She calls upon the industry to make better, more thoughtful choices, even as a new set of powerful AI tools are poised to change the world yet again. At its heart, this book is a love story to, for, and about tech from someone who knows it better than anyone.","18th book for 2024. Audiobook—Author ReadingWhen I was a psychology undergraduate at university in Australia in the early 1990s I was given access to the university VAX computers as part of our compulsory statistics course. This was still a time when typing up an essay, with errors corrected in tippex was seen as fancy, most students still handwrote course assignments, and most professors still hadn't learnt of email, and HTML was a few years away. What my professor didn't know was that having a VAX account came along with Internet access and when I realized this I went wild. Suddenly I had access to email and Usenet discussion groups. On a backgammon group I suggested we stop talking about games and actually play them, and so ended up running the first International BG tournament through my statistics account—non-trivial as email was the sole form of communication for players (how do you show a board? how do you roll dice in a way that players see as fair?). My professor commended me for being so hard working as my time online was audited.It's clear from her account that Swisher got the Internet as I did, and took the jump, leaving a golden path to politics reporter at the Washington Post to the (then) very niche job of tech reporter on the West Coast. She was there at the beginning and broke many key stories on Silicon Valley as it developed, and in the process becoming a Silicon Valley icon herself.So this book should have been a easy win for me. However, it turned out to be a vapid nothingburger. The book is made up of chapters where Swisher mostly bashes Internet founders as narcissistic white man children—something I can get behind—but her analysis is so shallow it basically exists at the level of name calling. The Google Founders are labelled the weird twins and criticised in a mild way for ripping off intellectual property. Mark Zuckerberg is apparently still a teenage arsehole that sweats a lot when he's nervous. Bezos is super ambitious and given a star for getting internet delivery sorted out—but is also an arsehole. Musk was apparently a great guy until he bought Twitter and ruined it for Swisher (what about all the shitty things he did before then with Tesla??). Steve Jobs was an arsehole, but a visionary and so he gets a pass. Nothing she says is interesting or deep or new here. The other chapters are a sort of Wikipedia style summary of her life. She got a job here, she dated so and so, married someone else, had a child, started this business or that business. None of it is anywhere deep or personal enough to be of much interest. Most of this seems to be either to puff-up her self worth or aid in her slagging off of this or that boss from decades past. She also has this annoying habit of constantly talking about how ""tough"" she is, how ""mean but fair"" she is. Isn't that what any decent journalist is? The only thing I'll take from the book is Sergey Brin's baby shower in 2008, where the rich and famous attendees were forced to choose between wearing nappies or onesies, and could drink expensive vodka dripping from an ice statue's nipple. Normally I don't give one-stars, as I usually abandon these sorts of books before the end, but since I finished this one I'll rate it.1-star.",1.0
313,The Wives: A Memoir,Memoir,"” —Publishers Weekly, starred review“A fearless, engaging, and important memoir.” —Library Journal, starred review“[A] gorgeously rendered peek behind the curtain of military life.” —Booklist, starred reviewA captivating memoir that tells the story of one woman’s experience of joining a community of army wives after leaving her New York City job—a profoundly intimate look at marriage, friendship, and the power of human connection.When her new husband joins an elite Army unit, Simone Gorrindo is uprooted from New York City and dropped into Columbus, Georgia. With her husband frequently deployed, Simone is left to find her place in this new world, alone—until she meets the wives.Gorrindo gives us an intimate look into the inner lives of a remarkable group of women and a tender, unflinching portrait of a marriage. A love story, an unforgettable coming-of-age tale, and a bracing tour of the intractable divisions that plague our country today, The Wives offers a rare and powerful gift: a hopeful stitch in the fabric of a torn America.","Release Date April 9, 2024I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir.The author was able to share her life as an army wife and helps to shed light on the trials and tribulations of the army life that spouses experience when their loved one is deployed.Written in a way that non-military individuals can understand, it also allows a connection for those of us who do understand the life because we’ve lived it.I found the genuine connections the author made with other wives to be heartwarming. The relationship aspect with her husband was also a highlight for me. Told in such a way that this feels part novel, part real life, I found myself highly interested from the start.Would highly recomend if you are looking for a memoir that gives you all the feels, pulls your heartstrings and gives you a glimpse at military life.",5.0
314,Me,Nonfiction,"In his only official autobiography, music icon Elton John writes about his extraordinary life, which is also the subject of the film Rocketman.Christened Reginald Dwight, he was a shy boy with Buddy Holly glasses who grew up in the London suburb of Pinner and dreamed of becoming a pop star. By the age of twenty-three, he was on his first tour of America, facing an astonished audience in his tight silver hotpants, bare legs and a T-shirt with ROCK AND ROLL emblazoned across it in sequins. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again.His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with song-writing partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with the Queen; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation. All the while, Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade.In Me Elton also writes about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father.","EDIT: I’m changing this to FIVE stars (from four). I keep recommending it and thinking about it and loving on Elton’s infectious and unique personality. I watched the movie last week and kept adding details where I thought they glossed over and narrating to my husband as we watched (haha sorry husband!) and it made me realize how much his book has stuck with me. Then we saw his concert which was phenomenal and now I just can’t get enough Elton in my life which tells me this book deserves ALL THE STARS!!!!Read the official autobiography: ✅Watch ‘Rocketman’: ✅See Elton John LIVE on his official farewell tour!: ✅“When you reminisce about the good old days, you naturally see it all through rose-tinted spectacles. In my case in particular, I think that’s forgivable, because I probably was literally wearing rose-tinted spectacles at the time, with flashing lights and ostrich feathers attached to them. But if you end up convincing yourself that everything in the past was better than it is now, you might as well give up writing music and retire.”This was marvelous. What an unapologetic, authentic, entertaining autobiography. I literally laughed out loud on more than a few occasions and even shed a few tears. I only wish I was more familiar with artists from the 1960s and 1970s so I could have had more context. I think for anyone who grew up listening to Elton and his peers, and even if you didn’t, this book will blow you away.Here’s hoping our show isn’t a “very occasional” one ☺️“I’ve played with my childhood heroes and some of the greatest artists in the history of music; I’ve played with people who were so hopeless they had no business being onstage and I’ve played with a group of male strippers dressed as Cub Scouts. I’ve done gigs dressed as a woman, a cat, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, a Ruritanian general, a musketeer, a pantomime dame and, very occasionally, I’ve played gigs dressed like a normal human being.”",5.0

I was in my mid 20’s when Jersey Shore exploded on televisions everywhere. I was not a fan of Mike “The Situation”. I thought he was an arrogant jerk. I was into the first few seasons of Jersey Shore but then my interest faded. I wasn’t even interested in the revival that happened years later with Jersey Shore Family Reunion.Fast forward to 2019, I’m lying in bed recovering from a root canal infection and I see a Jersey Shore Family Vacation marathon on tv. I think to myself, “What the hell? I have nothing better to do.” I didn’t know if it was the fever from the infection or what, but all of a sudden I saw Mike in this new light. Who is this mature, respectful man I see? Big Daddy Sitch, that’s who. This memoir made me gasp, laugh, recoil, and cry. But, that’s what any good memoir will do to you. His story is told in an incredibly honest and painful way. As someone who has had family members that struggle with addiction, I could relate to nearly every character in Mike’s story. Feeling sympathy for Mike, wishing throughout the book that he’d get the help he needed. Feeling the frustration from family members as they relive each drug addled episode like the Groundhog Day from hell. Feeling profound disappointment when he was sentenced to prison after turning his life around. And feeling hope when Mike recited one of his many mantras, “Calm seas never made a good sailor”.If memoirs are your jam, please pick up this book. If you know and have seen Mike since the beginning of Jersey Shore, you will understand him completely after reading this book.Long Live Big Daddy Sitch.",5.0
316,"Love, Pamela",Nonfiction,"My dreams often come true -- a curse, and a blessing.Pamela Anderson's blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands during a Canadian football game, she was quickly launched into superstardom, becoming Playboy's favorite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sex appeal. Yet the Pamela Anderson we think we know was created through happenstance rather than careful cultivation. Love, Pamela brings forth her true story: that of a small-town girl getting tangled up in her own dream.Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unwittingly stylish parents, Pamela lived a hardscrabble childhood but developed a deep love for nature, populating her world with misfits, apparitional friends, and injured animals. Eventually overcoming her natural shyness, Pamela's restless imagination propelled her into a life few can dream of, from the beaches of Malibu to the coveted scene at the Playboy Mansion. As her star rose, she found herself a fixture of tabloid fodder, at the height of an era when paparazzi tactics were bent on destroying a person's image and self-esteem.Pamela forged ahead with grace, finding sanctuary in her love of art and literature, and emerged a devoted mother and activist. Now, having returned to the island of her childhood, after a memorable run starring as Roxie in Chicago on Broadway, Pamela is telling her story, a story of an irrepressible free spirit coming home and discovering herself anew at every turn. With vivid prose interspersed with bursts of original poetry, Love, Pamela is a pensive, layered, and unforgettable memoir.",I fucking loved this. It was a true surprise. I was expecting a spill the tea dishy memoir and got poetry and existential philosophy in a completely palatable way. Truly an enigma in a red bathing suit. I highly recommend this book. Hers is a story worth learning about.,5.0
317,"The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church",Nonfiction,"Persistently worried that her gay grandfather would go to hell unless she could reach him, or that her Muslim friend would need to be converted, and that she, too, would go to hell if she did not believe fervently enough, McCammon was a rule-follower and--most of the time--a true believer. But through it all, she was increasingly plagued by fears and deep questions as the belief system she'd been carefully taught clashed with her expanding understanding of the outside world.After spending her early adult life striving to make sense of an unraveling worldview, by her 30s, she found herself face-to-face with it once again as she covered the Trump campaign for NPR, where she witnessed first-hand the power and influence that evangelical Christian beliefs held on the political right. McCammon also came to discover that she is among a rising generation of the children of evangelicalism who are growing up and fleeing the fold, who are thinking for themselves and deconstructing what feel like the “alternative facts” of their childhood.Rigorously reported and deeply personal, The Exvangelicals is the story of the people who make up this generational tipping point, including McCammon herself. Part memoir, part investigative journalism, this is the first definitive book that names and describes the post-evangelical movement--identifying its origins, telling the stories of its members, and examining its vast cultural, social, and political impact.","As a member of what I consider the Christian Left, I often wonder if I’m reading the same Bible as the Evangelicals that follow Trump. Where is the compassion for our fellow man? Where is the concern, not just for an embryo, but also the child? So, I was interested to see what Sarah McCammon had to say about the supposed growing number of younger people leaving the movement. I think one of the important things she says is that it’s not just a religious sect, it’s a community and a culture and leaving it often leads to the loss of family and friends. McCammon walks the reader through the mindset of the Evangelical culture, especially the belief that the Bible is infallible, scientists are not to be trusted and only they know the “truth”. She spends a lot of time on their refusal to believe in evolution. It actually gave me a better understanding of how so many can fall for Trump’s claptrap. When your belief system doesn’t allow for any wavering or skepticism, for any allowance for change, it makes it more plausible that you’ll only accept the “facts” that suit your narrative, regardless of their accuracy. “Information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe’s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. ‘Good for our side’ and ‘true’ begin to blur into one.”The one problem I had with the book is that she never really makes her case for “the massive social movement” of people leaving the evangelical church. She cites individuals and their reasons - LGBTQ+ issues, women’s roles, sexual freedom and corporal punishment. But I never got a sense of how many people she was talking about. Likewise, while I found the section on religious trauma enlightening, I was curious to know how widespread it was. Maybe there’s no way to know. But I would have been interested to know if there were any studies. This is probably a book that will “preach to the choir”. I can’t envision many still firmly invested in the evangelical movement reading it. But maybe it will provide a sense of community to those who have left but feel they’re alone in their situation. I was impressed by the number of folks she mentions that have social media presences. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.Update - this book is really sticking with me. I find myself recommending it right and left.",4.0
318,Yearbook,Nonfiction,"Hi! I’m Seth! I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so… here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it’s likely the former, which is a fancy “book” way of saying “the first one.”)  I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day. I hope you enjoy the book should you buy it, and if you don’t enjoy it, I’m sorry. If you ever see me on the street and explain the situation, I’ll do my best to make it up to you.","This essay collection is a fucking delight. The stories are incredibly funny and the hilarity builds to a crescendo with an essay about meeting musicians. I rarely laugh out loud while reading even very funny books but this one has me cracking up over and over and waking up my wife. There are a lot of interesting observations about fame, drugs, coming of age, and the like. The authorial voice is the strongest part of this book. Rogen knows he is a good storyteller and it shows, throughout. This is one of those collections of personal essays that are personal but impersonal. I respect it! Boundaries are good but there are places where I would have appreciated more personal insight or getting to know about the man behind the humor. What I’m saying is that there isn’t an essay about pottery and I would have loved to read about how he got into throwing clay. As an aside, I would also love to read an essay or book from him on screenwriting and storytelling.Anyway, like I said, a fucking delight and there is a level of self-awareness and an acknowledgment of privilege re: consuming weed as a white man that I appreciated. Hilarious! Charming! Sweet!",4.0
319,The Diary of a Young Girl,Classics,"Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover","Why do we write reviews?You have a lot of reasons I guess.But for this review there is only one. I am writing this for my conscience. Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with-DO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresome.I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world. No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now?Well she didn’t survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back.",5.0
320,Becoming,Nonfiction,"In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.","Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-	Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”-	Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?-	Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-	Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-	Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?-	Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite” -	Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?-	Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-	Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).-	Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.-	Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-	Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-	Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.-	Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-	Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”-	“Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97-	“Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97-	“I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97-	“Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99-	“There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99-	“He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101-	“Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103-	“He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105-	“Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105-	“Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111-	“This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112-	“I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117-	 “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123-	“All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131-	For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-	She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-	Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-	She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-	She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-	She failed the bar exam the first time around-	She very much dislikes politics-	She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-	She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-	Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-	She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.-	She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”. That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.	As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. 	Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the pussy” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.",3.0
321,Educated,Nonfiction,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.","On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.
Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times
We had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene’s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.
…he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers’ award is a really exciting one.

322,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,Nonfiction,"The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.","I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart's successor on 
The Daily Show
. I inherently knew that they wouldn't pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart's, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he'd be able to tough it out and show the stuff—comedic and otherwise—of which he was made.After reading 
Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood
, I realize that I needn't have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media's eye, he'd have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!!""On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.""Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn't be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn't walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way.""She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.""
Born a Crime
 provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn't white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah's day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It's also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other.More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends).I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on 
The Daily Show
. This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn't go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show—other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap.I've heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah's story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn't heavy-handed; it's fun, insightful, and very compelling.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.",4.0
323,I'm Glad My Mom Died,Nonfiction,"A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life.Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that. Do read this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars",4.0
324,Bossypants,Nonfiction,"Before Liz Lemon, before ""Weekend Update,"" before ""Sarah Palin,"" Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.She has seen both these dreams come true.At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.","Tina Fey's Bossypants was a disappointment. I don't know that expecting much from a comedy writer's cash-in big-font-with-pictures essay/memoir...thing...is fair, but I've been a Tina Fey fan since 30 Rock began, ready to trust her literary aspirations, and even to me this book barely scratches onto the two star plateau.What did I expect? Well, it's probably easier to explain what I didn't expect. I wasn't counting on a sour, muddled, defensive screed against anyone who pissed off the author in the last thirty years. I wasn't hoping for forced, obvious stories about the professional discrimination in Fey's history. I wasn't looking forward to insecure ramblings about the long hours she put into Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. And I definitely wasn't expecting all of the above to be sugarcoated by a combination of weak, insecure meta-analysis and self-conscious “oh, I'm really not that great” coverups. You know why Bossypants bugged me? Tina Fey has nothing for which to apologize. She's smart, she's funny, and she's talented. So I assume this book had some sort of cathartic impact and she needed to get this bile out of her system. Bossypants gets credit for three short, quality sections. First, Fey tackles the “what's that scar on your face?” question right up front and follows with some funny, interesting commentary on how she can gauge people by how they respond to the scar. Second, she answers a few critical emails/blog comments as a “question and answer” chapter. Third, she walks the reader through a detailed analysis of the whole “I look like Sarah Palin” era. I read this book quickly, over two nights, and while Bossypants is well-written, for the most part, the subject matter's dour nature left me cold, oh, 75% of the time.Listen. I didn't pick this book up whispering, under my breath, “Make me laugh right NOW, Tina Fey! Dance, monkey, dance!” But I feel like Tina Fey wrote this book for 1) young women she's trying to inspire, and 2) all the people who hate her who will never read this book, anyway. Maybe 41 year old white guys weren't her target audience. I can live with that. I'll still watch 30 Rock, though, and not just because she's hot. I just hope next time Fey writes a better book.",2.0
326,The Autobiography of Malcolm X,Nonfiction,"Alternate cover for ISBN 9780345350688Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself ""the angriest Black man in America"" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind. An established classic of modern America, ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" was hailed by the New York Times as ""Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book."" Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcolm X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, and the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared.","“I’ve had enough of someone else’s propaganda. I’m for truth, no matter who tells it. I’m for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I’m a human being first and foremost, and as such I’m for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.”  - Malcolm XIn High School my history syllabus covered just a few pages on African-American civil rights heroes. The majority of those pages were on Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X was barely mentioned. After reading this book I was perplexed! I wonder why Malcolm X hasn't been given the same respect as Dr. King; he contributed so much to the civil rights movement as well, yet my knowledge on this man was very minimal.How did Malcolm Little become Malcolm X aka El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz? This is what this book is all about. His transformation was remarkable especially as he spent time in foster homes and was a hustler in Detroit. He lived in an America where smart black kids were discouraged from being lawyers etc, and thus dropped out of school at young ages. It made me think for the umpteenth time just how can society malign and vilify black people, especially black men, when society itself is responsible for restricting them in the first place?Among the many things I admired about Malcolm X was his thirst for knowledge. He is a great advertisement for autodidactism and how effective and transformative self-education can be:  “I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there, in prison, that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive.” It was hard for me to read this book and not compare Malcolm X’s philosophy to Dr. King’s. I always thought I would adhere more closely to Dr. King’s peaceful, nonviolence philosophy, but after reading this book I do agree with Malcolm X’s ideology as well. Not that I am advocating violence, but radicalness and action is sometimes needed, as are anger and indignation. As Malcolm X said, ““So early in life, I learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise.” I feel there is so much to learn from both men so I won’t say I prefer one doctrine over another. At the same time I wonder, how can people not become militant and revolutionary after having experienced so much cruelty and discrimination?Another thing I found interesting in this autobiography was Malcolm X’s religious transformation; from having been raised Christian, to entering the Nation of Islam (NOI), he finally found his spiritual home in “mainstream” Islam. His depiction of his trip to Mecca in particular was very enlightening and a turning point in his life. His adoration of Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the NOI, was quite sad, especially as Muhammad seems to have been a bit of a weirdo. Muhammad said something along the lines of too-short women marrying tall men and vice versa is ridiculous. Also, he said that a man should ideally marry a woman half his age plus 7 years. Malcolm is unapologetic about his views in this book and that's what I love best about this autobiography. His writing is very candid and so informative. This is an important book for all to read. The prevalence of eurocentrism in the world is astounding and I don’t think we really realize just how established it is. Malcolm X dissected the race problem so well, I felt inspired.",5.0
327,I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban,Nonfiction,"I come from a country that was created at midnight. When I almost died it was just after midday.When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate.I Am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.","Reading this book reminded me of how much I take for granted every day: Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion. The freedom to go to the store without needing a male escort. And the ability to get an education, regardless of gender.""I was a girl in a land where rifles are fired in celebration of a son, while daughters are hidden away behind a curtain, their role in life simply to prepare food and give birth to children.""Malala, who is now 16, is an outspoken advocate for girls to have the same right to go to school as boys. In her native Pakistan, she lost that ability when the Taliban took over: ""I was 10 when the Taliban came to our valley ... It seemed to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires. They appeared in groups, armed with knives and Kalashnikovs ... They looked so dark and dirty and that my father's friend described them as 'people deprived of baths and barbers.'""The Taliban started bombing schools and decreed that girls couldn't get an education. Malala's father was a school principal and encouraged her to speak out. She was only 15 at the time, but threats were made against her and her family. And in October 2012, when she was riding the school bus with her friends, a man with a gun climbed aboard the vehicle and shot Malala in the head.Amazingly, Malala survived the bullet and was able to recover. She and her family currently live in England, but Malala writes about how much she misses her home country and wishes she could return to be with her friends. Her graciousness was such that she did not wish revenge on her attacker, and instead prays for peace.""I thank Allah for the hardworking doctors, for my recovery and for sending us to this world where we may struggle for our survival. Some people choose good ways and some choose bad ways. One person's bullet hit me. It swelled my brain, stole my hearing and cut the nerve of my left face in the space of a second. And after that one second there were millions of people praying for my life and talented doctors who gave me my body back. I was a good girl. In my heart I had only the desire to help people.""Malala's story is both heartbreaking and inspiring. I admire her courage and her tenacity, and also hope that her country will one day find peace. ""Why are we Muslims fighting with each other? ... We should focus on practical issues. We have so many people in our country who are illiterate, and many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.""The book is lovingly written, and I also appreciated her stories about the history of Pakistan and her people, the Pashtuns. While reading the book I realized that I knew more about the history of other countries in the region, such as Afghanistan, Iran and India, than I did about Pakistan, and it was very informative. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in women's rights, current events, history or inspirational memoirs.""Today we all know education is our basic right. Not just in the West; Islam too has given us this right. Islam says every girl and every boy should go to school. In the Quran it is written, God wants us to have knowledge. He wants us to know why the sky is blue and about oceans and stars ... The Taliban could take our pens and books, but they couldn't stop our minds from thinking.""Update October 2014:I was thrilled to hear that Malala had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. I have recommended this book to numerous people in the past year, and am still amazed by her courage. Three cheers for Malala!",5.0
328,The Glass Castle,Nonfiction,"When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family. The Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered.The Glass Castle is truly astonishing--a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family.","My sister saw The Glass Castle on my coffee table and said, “Oh, I read that. It’s kind of . . .” then she paused and we both were awkwardly silent for a minute. “Well, I was going to say, it’s kind of like us, a little bit, but not –““Yeah,” I said. “I wasn’t going to say it – because not all of it – ““Yeah, not all of it.”We didn’t talk about it again. When I first saw this book, I think I died a little inside because of the cover. I didn’t hate The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood like I hated The Mermaid Chair or (*shudder*) Bastard out of Carolina, but when there’s a little girl on the cover of a book, looking all innocent, it’s like a movie with the word “Education” in the title. You just know you’re in for a published trip to the psychiatrist’s couch. Kiddy-sex and soul-searching. I’m not saying people shouldn’t tell their stories (I mean, look at me, I’m all up in your website telling my stories), but I do think people should get a handle on what their story is before they try to tell it. Or at least before they make me read it. Sorry, that’s kind of asshole-ish of me to say, but I just think a lot of books with innocent little girls on the cover are really arrogant. They have this sense that since some man did something horrifying, everything that women do, including dancing around a fire with girlfriends or taking exotic lovers, is just part of the loving circle of nature’s healing. I am such a fan of women, and so I take it personally when we look like morons. This book has absolutely nothing in common with its cover. I haven’t written a review of it before because I think it is a perfect book, and how do you review a perfect book? I’m like Wayne and Garth when they meet Alice Cooper. This book is my Alice Cooper. I’m sure it wouldn’t be everyone’s Alice Cooper, but to me this is exactly what a book should be. Everything about the book is simple, concise, and action-packed. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. The people are incredible, but deep and smart and human. In some ways, I think this book is the Great American Story, but it’s the story none of us talk about and all of us live. In other ways, the book is so specific and personal to the Walls family that I never would have imagined the stories if I had not been told them. Virginia Woolf and Rainer Maria Rilke, two of the wisest people I have read, both ask when and how women will be able to tell stories without being self-conscious that they are women. How can we write, or even live, not as reactions to men, but as separate masters of our own experiences? I don’t know where the genders are on the space/time continuum of respecting each other, and I think there are probably gender-related specifics to any story (maybe that’s just natural and not even bad), but there is something about this book that is just human and strong. It is compassionate and unflinching. Oh, I hate adjectives. Just, read the first chapter of this book, and if you don’t think it’s compelling, don’t keep reading because it’s probably not for you. My family was nomadic, like Jeannette Walls’s family, but, like I say, all of her stories, and my stories, are unique. When I last lived with my parents, it struck me that we never really understand other people’s relationships with each other. I grew up, probably as many of us did, thinking that my parents never really got along and that my mom was a victim of my dad’s anger and wild scheming. But, later, I realized they probably both got something that I never understood out of their relationship. I think a lot of this book is about how we know the people we are close to and, also, never really do – how it is useless to hold other people to our own standards of what love or responsibility looks like. But, still, it is about holding each other responsible. Or, maybe the book is just about her family with no real moral lesson at all. Walls is so loyal to her stories in an almost scientific way. None of the adult outrage that contaminates so many stories of children creeps into Walls’s. She tells you what happened, and maybe how she felt about it at the time, but she doesn’t impose emotion on the reader. Here’s just a small part (well, actually, half . . . I couldn’t resist) of the first chapter to give you a little taste:Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She’d made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men’s shoes. She’d washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. “It’s my baby girl!” she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. “A little snack for later on,” she explained.We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. “You know how I love my seafood,” she said.She started talking about Picasso. She’d seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn’t really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.“I’m worried about you,” I said. “Tell me what I can do to help.”Her smile faded. “What makes you think I need your help?”“I’m not rich,” I said. “But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need.”She thought for a moment. “I could use an electrolysis treatment.”“Be serious.”“I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good.”“Come on, Mom.” I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. “I’m talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better.”“You want to help me change my life?” Mom asked. “I’m fine. You’re the one who needs help. Your values are all confused.”“Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago.”“Well, people in this country are too wasteful. It’s my way of recycling.” She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. “Why didn’t you say hello?”“I was too ashamed, Mom. I hid.”Mom pointed her chopsticks at me. “You see?” she said. “Right there. That’s exactly what I’m saying. You’re way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it.”“And what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?”“Just tell the truth,” Mom said. “That’s simple enough.”It’s been a while since I read this book, so a lot of the stories aren’t fresh in my mind, but some are so vivid to me that I think of them whenever I see a trash can or think of the desert. In high school, I thought that American history was the most boring topic imaginable. Then, in college, I took a class called the History of Women in the U.S., and I realized that I think the history of industry and conquest is mind-numbing, but the history of actual people is riveting. The Glass Castle is a real, honest history (or as honest as histories can be) of people in America. It is so close to me and so foreign in just the way this country is. It is also, in a way, a tribute to family oral histories. My dad has a . . . loose . . . relationship with the truth, as I’ve probably mentioned on this site before. In the past couple of years, every time I see one of my siblings, we sit around and tell stories from my dad or about my dad, trying to weed out what actually happened, what got a nice polish in the story factory, and what is an outright lie. I get that same feeling from this book – of siblings sitting around and saying, “Do you remember . . .” and “You weren’t there this one time . . .” or “No, that’s just what Dad said happened, what actually happened was . . .” I’m sure someday, my siblings and I will put together a history of our own, since every one of us seems to have inherited the storytelling gene. Whatever I write will be in some way inspired by this book.",5.0
329,Night,Nonfiction,"Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania, Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944 to Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is the terrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jew confronting the absolute evil of man. This new translation by his wife and most frequent translator, Marion Wiesel, corrects important details and presents the most accurate rendering in English of Elie Wiesel's testimony to what happened in the camps and of his unforgettable message that this horror must simply never be allowed to happen again.","The author, who is actually in the above picture, said it best in the forward; “Only those who experienced Auschwitz know what it was.” I think we can all agree with that. But can we, the reader, even understand what happened there? Can modern men and women comprehend that cursed universe? I’m not entirely sure.I first read this in my eighth grade History class. I was 13. It changed my life. Before this book my world was sunshine and rainbows. My biggest concern was whether or not a boy named Jason liked me back. I got mad at my mom when she made me go to bed on time, I complained if I didn’t like what we were having for dinner and I argued about what I was and wasn’t allowed to watch on TV. I thought I knew about WWII. Both of my grandfathers served in it and so my parents wanted to make sure that we understood the sacrifices they made, the things they saw. I watched documentaries about it with my father, the history nerd, listened to the few stories that my grandfathers would tell, but up until that point I had been intentionally sheltered from the horrors of the holocaust. I had only been told in the vaguest terms what had happened, that so many millions of people had been killed, that Hitler and his men had sought to exterminate the Jewish people. My parents wanted to spare me from what exactly that meant until they thought I was mature enough to be able to absorb it. But then I read this. And for the first time in my life I was completely self-aware. I felt like a child, like a complete and utter fool. For what were my “problems” compared to those of this narrator? How “hard” was my life compared to what he endured? What millions of people similarly endured? I now understood my own insignificance in the grand scheme of things and suddenly the reality of the world was a crushing weight. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. It was dark. It was ugly and unforgiveable. I remember getting really angry when I finished this. Mostly I was angry at the world and at humanity as a whole but I unfairly turned some of that on my father. After all, he hadn’t prepared me for what I found in this book. At one point I even demanded that he explain this…thing to me. He couldn’t. Fifteen years later, my second read of this book has impacted me just as much as the first. There’s this question I kept asking myself while reading. That question, was ‘How?’. I’m sure that ‘Why?’ might seem the more obvious choice here but I couldn’t let myself wander down the rabbit warren that is that question. Madness lies at the end of it. So I’m left with ‘How?’. How did this happen? How did so many average human beings contribute to this? How did the SS working in the camps reach the point that they were physically and mentally able to toss live infants into flames? How were the German girls that lived within smelling distance of Auschwitz able to pass love notes to the soldiers that marched their skeletal prisoners past? How did these same starving prisoners manage to run 20 kilometers in the freezing snow? How could the SS officers that shot them if they stopped on the first day of their death march then shout encouragements to them the next? How could the German citizens near the train tracks throw bread into the prisoners’ cattle cars just to watch them murder each other for it? How could human beings do these things to each other? How? HOW? 
HOW???
 Like my father, I have no answers.And that, I believe, is why many modern humans will never really be able to comprehend the things that happen in this book. Absorb it, yes. Bear witness to it, yes. Understand it? Hopefully never. I finished this at lunch today. And now I’m sitting in my cubicle, glancing at my neighbors and wondering if they’re capable of this kind of depravity. Am I? What would I do to survive? Would I beat my own father to death for the bread in his hand? I hope to God that none of us will ever have to find out the answers to these questions. If you read a single book in your life, this should be it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest",5.0
330,Yes Please,Nonfiction,"In Amy Poehler’s highly anticipated first book, Yes Please, she offers up a big juicy stew of personal stories, funny bits on sex and love and friendship and parenthood and real life advice (some useful, some not so much), like when to be funny and when to be serious. Powered by Amy’s charming and hilarious, biting yet wise voice, Yes Please is a book full of words to live by.","This is not a comedy book. I mean, it's funny. Amy Poehler can't write a book and not be funny, because she's Amy fuckin' Poehler. But (and this is not the first time I'm going to compare the two memoirs) where Tina Fey's Bossypants contained humorous essays written specifically for the purpose of being funny, Poehler's does not. Everything is presented in a straightforward, matter-of-fact, fashion, and although a lot of the book is very, very funny, it never seems like this was the specific goal behind the essays. This is also not a book about comedy. Although Amy Poehler discusses her time on improv groups in Chicago and New York, Saturday Night Live, and Parks and Recreation, she never gets more in-depth than ""then we moved to New York and started working at this theater."" Her time on SNL is reduced to a chapter of brief (but fantastic) anecdotes. Amy Poehler is renowned for her ability to play vastly different characters - somewhere on the internet is a photo gallery of all her Second City characters - but she never discusses what goes into each character. The closest we get is this description of her preparing her Hillary Clinton imitation and finally getting a bead on the character by playing her as someone who is tired of always being the smartest person in the room. Okay, so it's not a comedy book, and it's not a book about comedy, and it's really not even much of a memoir - Poehler does not discuss her divorce because ""it is too sad and too personal. I also don't like people knowing my shit."" So what, exactly, is Yes Please?It feels weird to classify this book as a self-help book. But that's what I got out of it. Maybe your experience with Poehler's book will be different, but as I was reading it, the parts that left the greatest impressions on me are the ones where she is demonstrating how to be a good person. The title itself references this - Poehler spends some time discussing how the improv rule of always replying with ""yes, and..."" is also a good rule for life, and how she tacks ""please"" onto that because Amy Poehler is truly, genuinely, wonderfully nice, and that's always refreshing. But lest you think she's some kind of pushover, rest assured that Amy Poehler is also a badass who gets what she wants, and if you pay attention, she can teach you how to do that:""When someone is being rude, abusing their power, or not respecting you, just call them out in a really obvious way. Say, 'I can't understand why you are being rude because you are the concierge and this is the part of the evening where the concierge helps me.' Act like they are an actor who has forgotten what part they are playing. It brings the attention back to them and gives you a minute to calm down so you don't do something silly like burst into tears or break their stupid fucking glasses.""She also teaches you how to be good at what you do, in a very good essay called ""Treat Your Career Like a Bad Boyfriend"":""Now, before I extend this metaphor, let me make a distinction between career and creativity. Creativity is connected to your passion, that light inside you that drives you. That joy that comes when you do something you love. That small voice that tells you, 'I like this. Do this again. You are good at it. Keep going.' That is the juicy stuff that lubricates our lives and helps us feel less alone in the world. Your creativity is not a bad boyfriend....You have to care about your work but not about the result. You have to care about how good you are and how good you feel, but not about how good people think you are or how good people think you look.""I don't want to imply that this is all heavy, here's-how-to-be-a-successful-person stuff. There's lightness in this book, and like I said, it's funny and fluffy, but there's a solid gold center deep within this seemingly light read that makes it stand out from other comedy memoirs I've read. I treated this book as a manual on how to become Amy Poehler, and there are worse things we could be. Have I mentioned that Amy Poehler is nice? She's so nice. She does the same thing Tina Fey did in her book where she lists a lot of the people who work on her TV show with her and it's basically an excuse for her to gush over how much she likes the people she works with (she calls Aubrey Plaze ""a big-hearted warrior""). She spends a long chapter talking about her sons and how much she loves them. Tiny Fey's book featured a chapter called ""We Don't Care if You Like It (One in a Series of Love Letters to Amy Poehler)."" Amy Poehler's book returns the favor by including an acrostic poem about Tina Fey, which might seem disingenuous, but it's clear on every page how much these two great people love each other:""Sometimes Tina is like a very talented bungee-jumping expert. All it takes is for Tina to softly say, 'We can do this, right?' and I suddenly feel like I can jump off a bridge.""I don't know how you guys reacted to that line, but when I read it I had to put the book down and immediately send a text to my best friend telling her I loved her. That's the effect Amy Poehler's book had on me: it taught me how to do what I wanted, how to feel good about myself, how to deal with whatever terrible things life throws at you, and it reminded me to be kind. And it's pretty fucking funny, so there's that.",5.0
331,When Breath Becomes Air,Nonfiction,"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","I finished the book and I'm glad that I perservered with it. It's quite an odd book and an overall rating might be the sum of the parts, but is not going to reflect the writing or content of those parts. Ratings, part I, 1 star, part II, 3 stars and part III, 5 stars.The first part, the foreword, by Abraham Verghese, was verbose, hagiographic and contradictory ie. full of shit. He said he didn't know the author at all until after his death. Then he says well he did meet him and they had a long email correspondence. And so it goes. He says it's the foreword but should be the afterword. Verghese must have sat there with a thesaurus composing endless sentences of praise for the author, who had, like most of us, never accomplished anything much out of the ordinary. I dnf'd this part and give it a whole, rounded-up 1 star.The second part, I feel churlish writing this, I really do. The author had an interesting career in his short life, mostly as a student. He had a MA in English Literature, another MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, a BSc in Human Biology and finally an MD from Yale, before going on to be a neurosurgeon. It was in his brief career as a neurosurgeon and scientist he was diagnosed with cancer. He tried his best to be introspective and give guidance through the exponentially-increasing awfulness that is the journey through this dread disease. The problem was, he wasn't a natural writer although he'd wanted to be one all his life. His prose might have been just the stuff of essays at his Ivy League universities, but to me it was reminiscent of a writers' group where each attempt to outdo the other with portent-laden phrases and lots of deep literary references. It was tedious in parts. But... he did his best and he was a good doctor, husband and father, and this was only his debut book. Five stars for the man, but three stars, just, for this central section of the book.The long afterword was written by his widow. She is a doctor too, but could easily be a writer. She just has 'it' and her late husband, who wanted it so much, didn't. She rounds out the story he told, and continued on at length in the most interesting and well-written part of the book. Her ability to convey emotion without getting either lyrical or sappy was excellent. Five stars. Dr. Lucy Kalanithi should have been credited as co-author. I hope she goes on writing.It won't make sense to read the last part without the second, but you can easily skip the foreword, all it adds is unnecessary verbiage and lots of pages to make it look more than just the thin tome it really is.________________An example of the really rather awful writing that got me down. You may disagree, you may feel that the three words I suggest - dawn came up, are no substitute for the 150 poetic, lyrical, descriptive ones the author wrote instead. I'm too hard, right? ""And then we would sit and watch as the first hint of sunlight, a light tinge of day blue would leak out of the eastern horizon, slowly erasing the stars. The day sky would spread wide and high until the first ray of the sun made an appearance. The morning commuters began to animate the distant south Lake Tahoe roads but craning your head back you could see the day's blue darken halfway across the sky and to the west the night remained yet unconquered. Pitch black, stars in full glimmer, the full moon still pinned in the sky. To the east the full light of the day beamed toward you. To the west, night reigned with no hint of surrender. No philosopher can explain the sublime better than this, standing between day and night. It was as if this was the moment God said, ""Let there be light.""Very poetic, very beautiful image. So anyway, dawn came up.",3.0
332,Spare,Nonfiction,"It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and horror. As Princess Diana was laid to rest, billions wondered what Prince William and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how their lives would play out from that point on.For Harry, this is that story at last.Before losing his mother, twelve-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more serious Heir. Grief changed everything. He struggled at school, struggled with anger, with loneliness—and, because he blamed the press for his mother’s death, he struggled to accept life in the spotlight.At twenty-one, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure, and two combat tours made him a hero at home. But he soon felt more lost than ever, suffering from post-traumatic stress and prone to crippling panic attacks. Above all, he couldn’t find true love. Then he met Meghan. The world was swept away by the couple’s cinematic romance and rejoiced in their fairy-tale wedding. But from the beginning, Harry and Meghan were preyed upon by the press, subjected to waves of abuse, racism, and lies. Watching his wife suffer, their safety and mental health at risk, Harry saw no other way to prevent the tragedy of history repeating itself but to flee his mother country. Over the centuries, leaving the Royal Family was an act few had dared. The last to try, in fact, had been his mother. . . .For the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, unflinching honesty. A landmark publication, Spare is full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.","This is the most difficult review I’ve ever written. So much so I had 4 attempts at writing it, and in the end scaled back much of what I wanted to say (including 17 of my most important themes and issues), to just a core few. Unlike Harry I deliberately tried to moderate what I have to say, which is incredibly challenging when reviewing this memoir. It is also especially challenging but important to keep your review concentrated on what is actually written in this book (including its publicity) and for that reason, I have made great efforts to set aside what I know and what I'm hearing, because to review this honestly it is important to ignore the rumour mill and the other news stories, and set aside your own perceptions. So my comments are based on what Harry has written in his book and in part his media circus surrounding its publication. All in the name of privacy.The reality is this. I too can highlight the many holes and inaccuracies in Harry’s stories, dates, and his own conflicting verbiage. I too can lash out at his many frivolous and insulting remarks that were so unnecessary and excruciatingly petty. I too can argue that many of Harry’s claims are based on his perception and personal choice and do not come with a fact base or credible evidence. However, my dislike of this fictional story goes much deeper, is much more fundamental and gets to the heart of someone’s character, their motives, and principles or lack of. Now you can see why I struggled with this so much, yet much of my own personal views will remain private.Regardless of which side you take on this, everyone that cares enough will find this all very sad. I am sure there are lessons to be learned on all sides in this family saga, and no shortage of regrets. Yet one thing I know for sure, we will never get to the real truth because one side will not resort to the petty and sometimes damaging allegations made by Harry, in this book. So William is nothing but an easy open target because he is part of an establishment that “never complains and never explains”, even when his wife is subjected to abuse from the media (much more than Meghan over the years).The themes and core issuesWhose privacy rules and standards do we follow and when? By writing this book Harry has sought worldwide media attention. He has signed a multiple book deal, featured in the Netflix series and engaged in a number of nonchallenging interviews, which is completely contrary to what he espouses which is privacy. And by doing so he has denied the Royal Family the privacy he supposedly craves. He has broken the privacy rules with regards to the late Queen, the now King, the future King, his stepmother, his sister-in-law, his friends, wider family, and his army colleagues - just about everyone really and that I find incredibly hypocritical. He even has the audacity to complain about his mother’s former butler, Paul Burrell, in the book when he is doing much worse- in his book. This is sheer hypocrisy on a monumental scale. Whose safety do you really care about? The second issue I have is that Harry left the UK to allegedly keep his family safe. I say allegedly because the narrative keeps changing. Even after reading the book, I am still unclear what the current version of events are and what his story is today. At what point will he be or was he telling the truth? Here is my deep concern. By publishing a kill count of 25 Taliban fighter’s aka chess pieces (in his own words) he has increased the risk to himself, his family, and many others in military service. I find this abhorrent and immoral, because every death is someone’s child, father, brother, or friend, and even in war we should respect that. What prudent person publishes a tally? My GR friends may recall, I recently read Diamond Eye, where the MC was a female sniper and whilst a heroine in the eyes of many, she actually kept a body count of her kills which did not sit well with me, for the same reason. Respect. Who does that? Yet once again Harry takes no responsibility and has since tried to change the narrative by blaming the press for manipulating his words despite the fact that this sordid comment is written by him in his own memoir. Diana had two sons, remember that when reading this story. I for one will always remember the heart-breaking image of Diana’s two sons walk behind their mother’s coffin. A life changing event for the boys she loved, which caused mental health issues for BOTH sons growing up, something they jointly opened up about and campaign for. Yet Harry does this publicly to William. Whilst the pain is evident in Harry's story, I ask myself, what mother, and particularly Diana, would be pleased and supportive of a son who has consciously and deliberately set out on a campaign to work against the other. By writing a book that will be forever in print and with allegations that don’t stack up in my opinion, Harry has created this impossible situation for Diana’s eldest son, knowing that William won’t or can’t respond. Does Harry believe that the mother he refers to often in the book would be proud?. William is a soft open target for Harry, which is why I have lost so much respect for Harry having taken this course of action. It would appear he is emotionally obtuse or ill advised or both. Either way someone is on the receiving end and its Diana's eldest son who she was very protective off as the future King. A life she knew would be dedicated to 'service' and 'duty' while Harry had much less restrictions and more freedom. See here is the different lens to 'Spare'.Have you ever tried to warn a family member against their choice? It is not easy but what does a loving sibling do when you have deep concerns? You do what William did - voice your reservations, but unfortunately, this seems to be what sits behind much of this sorry affair. Harry doesn’t want to hear or accept it. From what Harry has shared it would appear these conversations did not go well, and neither son comes out blameless, particularly the one when William allegedly grips Harry’s shirt. A lesson I hope all will learn from. Time will tell who was right though.There was one point in this whole saga that had me seething and sad and its when Harry claims that William recently says …I love you, Harry, on our mothers life I love you… God you can hear the anguish felt by William in those words. Yet Harry admits to throwing it back in William’s face, and then this guy claims he wants a reconciliation. Sorry Harry, as was your response - I don’t believe you and bleep bleep to the rest of what you said here. Disgraceful.I’m in a minority here on GR, by rating this a ‘1’ because most people I know who have a problem with Harry’s behaviour, integrity, and motives for writing this book have chosen not to waste their money or time on it. Which potentially provides a distorted view of UK public opinion, in particular.Comments about the book’s writing style and structureHad Harry thought about what he wanted to achieve from the book, he might have structured the book differently and placed greater emphasis on what was important for us to hear and what was important for the narrative he wanted to share. Instead this came across as an emotional download and mental dump of Harry’s lifelong grievances, and aimed at anyone who had an opposing view. This does not make him a victim, instead the pendulum swung the other way and this overload for the reader just painted him as vengeful and spoilt in my eyes. Yet we do know from our own history that Harry had some genuine issues with the press for example (the press also managed his image during his years of alcohol and drug abuse -which he admits to in the book) but all this was lost amongst so much needless complaints and insults directed towards others, and I just reached saturation point, with little accountability accepted or owned by Harry.Let me explain what I mean about having an objective. For example, if you wanted reconciliation then share the wrongs in a considered and constructive way and explain what it is you hope to fix and then let your actions support that. If you want the world to know you are at peace with yourself, then remove these rantings, because this book has achieved the opposite. If this story was to expose the media as part of your unwinnable war against the press, then why attack William the way you have?. By trying so hard to paint himself as victim, he created too many so called ‘enemies’ that in the end you could see why some people like me could conclude that the common problem here is in fact …. Harry. I am deliberately leaving Meghan out of this review.In terms of writing style, the book felt as though it was written by many different authors. Clipped sentences were replaced with more descriptive prose and much longer sentences, which seemed at odds with a book that had so many chapters. However, it was a stroke of genius to narrate your own story. A very clever marketing accomplishment that no doubt will have lured people and captured the sympathy of many readers. Even I was moved in the early chapters when I relived Diana’s death in particular, but when the venom kicked in and the objectivity was notably missing. Harry lost me.Had a level of sensitivity and maturity been applied to this story I might have responded differently. Had he shown some restraint and not made such unnecessary and insulting remarks about other people, I might have had some sympathy for the unsavoury press coverage he receives. Had I not believed in my heart that this was financially motivated, then I would have reacted differently. Had I not found the level of hypocrisy so distasteful, then I would have appraised this differently altogether. Had I not read Harry’s own words then I might never have been aware that this was in some part or largely driven out of revenge or jealousy, for his older brother and an accident of birth that he was born second. And finally, had Harry applied some level of objectivity then I might have respected some of what he was saying. For example the royal family have chosen a different approach to dealing with the press instead of Harry’s unwinnable war and his 20+ lawsuits. They want to rise above it and often ignore the stories written about them and advised Harry to do the same. Not only does he disagree with them, but he actually accuses them of planting the petty stories, he refers to in his book. Really - just sit back and think about it!!!Unfortunately one of my biggest issues with this book is its credibility. Is the book to explain the narrative? or is the narrative being written to suit and sell a book and his story now?. Had Harry come out at the beginning and stated his case or even hinted at the hurtful and damming accusations he is now making about his family. Had we been given a glimpse of this story he is now pedalling, (with the exception of the media) then the book might have felt more credible, his version more believable. Instead, it feels like it is only after his proposals to become a part time Royal were rejected that he has decided to be angry with his family so much so that he needs to tell the world about it. You would want out of this situation altogether if all this were true - not negotiate a different ‘Royal’ role that would allow you to pursue the celebrity lifestyle and fame that this couple appear to crave. I know what I think but it is up to you to draw your own conclusions.There was something to be said about the mystery and speculation surrounding the RF which allowed people like me to keep an open mind, because I thought there was more to it than what we were being told. Harry has dispelled any of those doubts. There is nothing of substance and no significant revelations that would go any way to justifying and explaining Harry’s betrayal of his family and their privacy.In summaryHarry claims to have secured his personal peace, but at what cost? The cost of betraying his family, army colleagues, friends, and the institution of the monarchy whilst at the same time compromising the privacy and potentially the security of others, including his family. Publishing his body count was immoral and insensitive to those impacted and his military colleagues. The way he has attacked William, feels disproportionate to anything William might have done and if there was something else then I’m sure Harry would have told us. So all of this has exacerbated an already strenuous relationship and makes any kind of reconciliation unlikely, but certainly more difficult. In my view, his gripe over being a ‘spare’ is disrespectful to the institution and the tax payers who support it, Many of us who have witnessed Harry's indulgent and privileged lifestyle over the years, when he was 3rd in line to the throne, will find this discourteous. Harry has had life handed to him on a silver plate, had the best of everything, and lived in some stunning homes. Yet he is that out of touch with the 'public mood' in the UK and so blinkered he would hope you would see him as a 'victim' and justified in ripping his family apart because he has had disagreements with his family, he was born second and had a smaller bedroom in Balmoral castle for example. Enough. Please, no more. Some readers will feel empathy for Harry’s statement that the RF will someday regret not being there for him during the second most difficult period of his life because they failed to defend him publicly. Yet they DO NOT defend themselves, their wives, and the wider family because it is their motto to ‘never complain, never explain’. Not some elaborate plan to oust a couple that could have offered so much. Not a case of treating couples differently as they would have you believe. Perhaps the RF need to reevaluate this motto they live by. Perhaps not because by in large it has prevented them from being embroiled in petty skirmishes with the media, that Harry himself seems intent on having when he’s not using them to support his book or to his own ends. Instead, they have risen above it and not challenged the stories, and if Harry really believes the RF would invest time in sharing stories with the press over lipgloss, a flower girls dress or whether a prince should wear a beard - then I fear for him. So, by publishing this bitter book that is heavily weighted against and critical of William, Harry has likely created the second most difficult time in Williams life and this course of action was deliberate and venomous. You are right, there will be regrets someday and it will be for writing this book. Hopefully you have now exhausted your bile. Now ‘spare’ us any more of this!!!And to remove any notions of bias, as a pro royalist. I am not a Royalist or in favour of keeping a large royal family. Some maybe because of the charity work they do and the causes they champion like William's 'Earthshot' programme, which is the stuff we really should be focused on. I also have issues with the lives of some of the RF but I am not here to comment on those. I am here to respond to Harry's book, his one-sided oxymoronic self indulgent story and his unverified allegations.So please ‘spare’ us anymore of this. Please enjoy your life in America. I sincerely wish you do something meaningful with your life, instead of swapping financial support from the RF with money gleaned from attacking the Royal Family. Having listened to Harry’s story, I have come out of this believing the real victims here are William and Kate. William who conducts himself so well publicly, but is restricted by protocol and Kate who has always remained dignified and classy. A wonderful ambassador for the RF. If only they could tell their side of the story. Yet Harry would have you believe Williams story is out there and this is Harry’s chance to tell his - what an insult to everything we have seen, witnessed and endured. Spare us please. Go live your life.And no more memoirs for me. I found this too challenging but I stand by my considered views that I deliberated over for a long time, although it has still pained me to express them, because Harry was once my favourite Royal.",1.0
333,Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,Nonfiction,"An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here.At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother’s death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life. With no experience or training, driven only by blind will, she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State — and she would do it alone.Told with suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.","EDIT 4/4/2014: I changed this from two stars to one, because I realized that it's been about two years since I read this book and I still get ragey and fist-shakey just thinking about how much it sucked. So, bonus star deducted. This book sucks on wheels. Read on for more...Okay. I gave myself plenty of time to cool off before writing this review, because man, was I ever pissed at this book by the time I finished reading it. And I really wanted to love it! I'm a backpacker, and I've often fantasized about doing the PCT solo (a pretty stupid idea for anybody who's not much more experienced than I am.) I was excited about a memoir of one woman's experience on the trail. I dug into this book eagerly, but within a few chapters my enthusiasm began to deflate, and by the end I was basically doing this at every other paragraph:After some cooling-off time, I gave it what I feel is a very generous two stars. That bonus star is for the first couple of chapters, which do in fact pull a person in, and which do share some impressive openness on the author's part. I was particularly impressed with her ability to share her weird dreams about killing her mother, which were raw and real and touching and disturbing. Also, the scene where she recalls how  the horse is ""put down"" was particularly affecting. Otherwise, this book just doesn't have all that much to offer. Cheryl Strayed's life doesn't, so far, have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments -- the kind of things that make for good memoir reading. Or if her life does contain those things, she's not a good enough writer to make the reader feel it. Brief rundown: Strayed lost a loving parent with whom she had a great relationship, and had a very difficult time accepting that loss. Not particularly different from the experiences of many people I've met. As a result of her grief, she lost all impulse control and sabotaged her marriage to a really wonderful man, then started using heroin. Okay, that's a little more interesting, but unfortunately the full impact of these momentous choices is lost in an unblazed forest of vague, unremarkable prose and confused chronology, making it hard to give a damn. At the nadir of her downward spiral, she hears about the PCT and just decides to hike it, which is not surprising, I guess, since she's proudly established that she suffers from a total lack of impulse control (a condition she never really seems to try to correct throughout the course of the book.) So hike it she does, all unprepared, derping off into the wilderness, as is par for the course, apparently. She can't even be assed to read the essential (and very short, I might add) book Staying Found: The Complete Map and Compass Handbook, an absolute essential for anybody who determines to walk off into the wilderness and survive by whatever she can carry on her back. Oh, she bothered to buy the book, but she neglected to read even a page of it on the flight from Minnesota or wherever she's from to southern California, although she brought it on board the plane intending to educate herself BEFORE she began her blissed-out hippie walkabout. But I guess, hey, free peanuts and a bad Adam Sandler movie, so....If you're getting the impression from the review that this memoir fails mostly because Strayed just doesn't make herself a very sympathetic character, you're getting the right idea. But it gets worse. Once she actually gets the high of hiking (under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT, for god's sake) the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature Walk.Everybody -- yes, literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her. She is that irresistible, all hairy and smelling like a sasquatch and hobbling from miles of carrying half her body weight. All the men she meets eye her appraisingly. Most of them hit on her and ask her out for dinner and drinks (wait...dinner and drinks on the Pacific Crest Trail? Yes, more on that later.) One of them actually does seduce her with the erotic power of his Wilco t-shirt. But the one message she clearly wants you to take away from her allegedly inspiring story of a complete personal transformation on the PCT is that the author is preternaturally sexy, and virtually nothing with a penis can resist her. Strayed's relentless hotness actually becomes such a prevalent theme that I began laughing out loud each time she described yet another man expressing his interest in her hot hiker self. I laughed a lot, O Reader. I laughed a lot.Don't worry; those people she met who didn't want to stick their trekking poles into her worshiped her for other reasons. Every single person she met except for some Totally Grumpy Old Camp Hosts and a couple creepy hunters (who still wanted to have sex with her) couldn't stop telling her how amazing and wonderful she was for hiking the PCT alone. Without any knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness. Everyone said things to reinforce her belief that she was a ""badass motherfucking Amazonian queen."" Hooray! The world is your oyster, 'cause that's all the world is!How did she meet so many people hiking one of the least-trammeled of the world-famous trails on the continent? Well, Strayed actually didn't hike all that much of the trail. She started well north of the Mexican border and had to take a Greyhound around most of the High Sierras, because it was socked in that year and she was unprepared for snow hiking, as she was for most other contingencies. (She got rid of her ice axe after crossing one small snowfield, figuring she wouldn't need it again, y'know, where the elevation got higher. Jesus Christ. Not that she really knew how to use an ice axe anyway.) Her intent was to do only the California stretch, not the entire trail, though she did extend the trip through Oregon after she found out about the impassability of the trail (another thing she should have checked on before she started walking.) So she motored through a good 400+ miles of her ""hike,"" and left the trail for various reasons at various points to hitch-hike instead. Thus, she ended up with a lot of non-hiker people in a lot of non-hiking situations, making this more a memoir of disjointed hippie travel-by-any-means than a memoir of HIKING THE EFFING PCT, as all bookbuyers were led to believe.The parts of the book that actually DID take place on the Trail were interrupted by flashbacks to her life with her mother or the destruction of her marriage or her experimentation with heroin or the fallout from these events. So much so, as soon as she began actually talking about the Trail again, I knew to brace myself for yet another forced emotional flashback to the ordinary tragedy of Strayed's typical American life. Now, in spite of the choking Mary Sueism of the author's self-depiction, I could forgive her utter dumbness in wandering onto the PCT unprepared if she actually learned anything about what a bad idea it is to wander into the wilderness unprepared. If her unpreparedness for the PCT taught her how to be a better person, more aware, more focused, more capable, more responsible, more honest about herself, GREAT. Bring on the stupidity. I like a good redemption tale. But it didn't. It didn't! If it did, those passages were lost in editing, or were never written at all. The book's big climax involves Strayed eating a peach in a grove of azaleas, and it's all very pretty and a deer walks into the clearing, and she realizes that it's totally okay to be who she is. And yeah, it's totally okay to be who you are if you're good with that, but she sets up her personal tragedies as a) being unable to cope with loss, b) intentionally destroying her relationship with a very good man, c) doing potentially deadly drugs, d) lacking all impulse control, and the big take-away lesson from her experience on the PCT is...don't ever change? What? The thing she learned from this experience was that it's just fine to fuck up other people's lives, because now she's A-Okay with herself?Come on!But even that...even that I could forgive if the writing were good. I will forgive anything for gorgeous writing. My favorite book of all time is Lolita, and I can forgive the existence of a fictional character like Humbert Humbert because, damn, have you ever read Lolita? (Strayed has, at least once, and apparently learned nothing about the value of lovely writing.) But the writing in Wild is, if you will forgive the pun, pedestrian at best. I suppose it's serviceable enough for a general memoir of an American woman having a typical American experience of loss and confusion and coming to accept her past. But for describing nature? Ugh. I wasn't expecting ""Annie Dillard hefts a Kelty"" from this book, but one would think that a book which alleges to focus on the great transforming power wilderness would at least give a little time or effort to, you know, wilderness. Miles and miles of trail are dismissed in the tritest and most cliche of short sentences, and as far as describing action, Strayed often resorts to such apprentice work as ""we kissed and kissed and kissed""; ""I walked and walked and walked""; ""I cried and cried and cried."" I yawned and yawned and yawned. I raged and raged and raged. The most vivid scene of actual trail action I can recall is where she falls asleep beside a muddy tarn and wakes to the feel of frogs hopping all over her body. The rest of the prose fell utterly flat, particularly in scenes involving nature. What a crashing disappointment. And what a rip-off, since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT. And there is virtually none of that here.It's no surprise to me that this book was selected for Oprah's Book Club (2.0, no less!) Oprah's selections have become, over the years, increasingly vapid and serving only the ""rah-rah, you go girl"" branding of the Club. I remember, long ago in a distant past, when she actually chose books that had good writing and fascinating characters. I should have been warned off by the fact that this book was picked, but I wanted so, so badly to read a well-written memoir about the enchantment of backpacking, about the way the strife and the loneliness and the rawness of nature pull the packer into another realm of existence, where life is fragile and valuable, where the sky and the earth and the line of the trail itself live, and by turns cradle and sustain the hiker and try and reject her. Instead, I got ""gee, my feet hurt."" The great American memoir of the PCT still remains to be written. I'm sad that it's not already here, that I don't get to read it. I'm elated that maybe I'll yet have the chance to accomplish what this book didn't accomplish. Maybe I'll get a chance to write it. I'm already planning my own trip from Mexico to Canada. (Not solo, though. That's just dumb.) Who knows.",1.0

""But what you call different, I call unique. I don’t mind being different.""
I won’t spoil the story *see, I can also write spoil-free reviews*. Sarah’s character could be described with this one line: 
""…as long as I could stand back up, I could fight.""
You know the typical romance ‘alpha’? You won’t find this a§§hole here, instead we have a real strong and honorable Man. No man is perfect and this one wasn’t either, but he was a good one. Stoic soldier, a good son of his country, a strong man. 
""Albert Einstein once said that the world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything.""
For my readers, who like possessive heroes – ladies, he is your man (but without OTT childish cavemanish tantrums – or, well, yeah, he was still sexy jealous).
""I don’t deserve you,"" he told me. ""I have more blood on my hands than you’ll ever know. I’m not good at the romance stuff or talking about how I feel. Shit, there’s going to be times you’ll scream at me in frustration because I don’t know how to do shit like normal people. But I’m never letting you go, buttercup. And until the day comes when they put me in a box in the ground, I’m yours.""
Loved how he loved her!
""My beautiful splash of colour in a sea of grey.""
The action was on a heavy side, but it made the story real. Some dark moments, mention of violence. Not everything was plausible, maybe some small plot holes. But overall highly enjoyable read!I really hope the fiction of this story would never become a reality.Safe! She wasn’t a virgin. He wasn’t a virgin either *lmao*, only little information about his sexual past (meaningless sex, no sleepovers and yada yada), but I wouldn’t call him a manwhore. No OW drama.I have so many amazing friends on GR and unfortunately we’ll very probably never meet in real life *sad*, but with this story you had an opportunity to meet my ‘doppelgänger’ - aka me in 30 years.Nan.

337,Wolf Trouble,Paranormal,"..There's never been a female on the Dallas SWAT team and Senior Corporal Xander Riggs prefers it that way. The elite pack of alpha male wolfshifters is no place for a woman. But Khaki Blake is no ordinary woman.When Khaki walks through the door attractive as hell and smelling like heaven, Xander doesn't know what the heck to do. Worse, she's put under his command and Xander's protective instincts go on high alert. When things start heating up both on and off the clock, it's almost impossible to keep their heads in the game and their hands off each other...","Reviewed by: Rabid Reads.Men in uniform is already a winning combination for the majority of romance readers, but then Paige Tyler went ahead, and sweetened the deal by casting sixteen alpha werewolves as this series’ heroes. WOLF TROUBLE was an improvement on the first book thanks to its less foreseeable plot twists, stronger amorous components, and because the shifter aspects were explored in greater detail. I thoroughly enjoyed my second SWAT experience, and will, without fail, be back for thirds!My two main criticisms of HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF were with regards to its lack of insight into the author’s wolves, and the overall cheesiness of the love story. Both of those issues were addressed in this installment, and as a result, I now have no problem committing to this series for the long haul. Tyler didn’t disclose all of her furry secrets, but she did provide an answer to my query about female werewolves, and explored it at length, so on that front I was completely satisfied.This novel’s plot was more along the lines of what I’ve come to expect from the Romantic Suspense genre as a whole with its multiple threads—none of which were overly predictable—and a generous helping of action to help offset the steamier bits. The author excelled at weaving in the various law agencies’ procedures by tackling things like inter-department collaboration, and bringing all of their specialized training to the fore. This book lived and breathed SWAT.Khaki and Xander’s relationship was a huge step in the right direction compared to the previous couples'; there were no eye rolling moments, and its progression felt more natural due to the female protagonist already being a cop… among other things. Yes, there were still a couple of things that were lost in translation, but it was normal men are from Mars, and women are from Venus stuff. The boss / subordinate dynamics also made the stakes more interesting to say the least.WOLF TROUBLE was a sexy game of tug-a-war between two alphas, and a must read. ~4.5 Stars",5.0
339,Witness to Passion,Romantic Suspense,"Under his protection and in his bed…For Fallon Wayland, birthdays are just another reminder of her looming spinsterhood. This year is shaping up to be no different. Unfairly fired from her job, dumped by her boyfriend, and oh yes, witnessing the murder of a high-ranking lieutenant in the local crime family… Yeah, birthdays suck.Ever since a disastrous, hot-as-hell kiss years ago, soldier-turned-security specialist Shane Roarke has avoided his baby sister’s reckless—and gorgeous—best friend. Yet when her life is threatened after she witnesses a gang hit, he insists on protecting her…even if she objects. The two are forced to hole up in a safe house. Alone. Passion long denied erupts between them, burning away their inhibitions. But even as layers—and clothes—are peeled away, danger closes in. Shane and Fallon might finally have a chance at love…if they survive long enough to see it.","3.5 Stars!!Fallon is a twenty-five years old girl who grew all her life without love and attention from her family. She saw what marriage did to her parents, so she’s not looking to tie the knot anytime soon or to be involved in a serious relationship. She may consider a no strings attached relationship with someone, but the thing is her lust interest doesn’t seem to notice her, or more exactly he doesn’t seem to see her like a woman. The reason? He is the big brother of her best friend. Shane Roarke is a former soldier turned security specialist, co-owner GDG Security Solutions. Shane knows Fallon for more than ten years. He saw her blossom in a lovely girl and later in a beautiful woman. He’s attracted to her, more than he wants to be and this is a bad, bad thing because he knows she’s off limits. For seven years since the ‘kiss incident’ he avoided his baby sister’s best friend like the plague, but when Fallon is in danger he’s ready to forget about their past and do anything to protect her. 

“She kissed like a sinner, not a saint. A sinner who enjoyed it. Just one crush of lips and tangle of tongues seven years ago, and he still remembered her taste. Sunshine and sex.”

Fallon still remembers that night when she embarrassed herself kissing Shane Roarke. She can admit to herself she still has a huge crush for this man who still insists she’s only like a sister to him. The two of them are forced by certain circumstances to hole up in a safe house. Alone. For an indefinite period of time. With too much free time. Well, well,...what can they do to fill their free time...especially when their chemistry is so sizzling. 

“Need was a living animal writhing inside her as she gripped his cock directly above his fist. Hot. Steel. Velvet. She tightened her hold, and it bucked and pulsed in her hand. This close his fresh wind scent was sharper, distilled, and combined with the unique musk that belonged solely to him, it made her mouth water for a taste. A taste…hell. She wanted to gorge herself on him.”

This read surprised me in a very good way. It had a little bit of everything, it was entertaining from start to finish and the writing was really engaging. While the suspense was low, the steam here was pretty high and I was more than fine with that. Both Fallon and Shane were likeable characters and their characterization was well done. Fallon is a girl who knows who she is and especially what she wants. She’s determined and funny and I just loved her sassiness. Shane was not as alpha as I expected, but I have to say he was just as good as one. He’s sexy, caring, considerate and protective. What annoyed me a little was the fact at times he acted like a high school kid...he thought too much..Anyway...I enjoyed their interactions, their sweet banter and of course the smexy sex scenes between them, which were hot as hell.  Overall, a great read!",4.0

341,Broken,Romantic Suspense,"Ex-SEAL and LOST founder Gabe Spencer is accustomed to the unusual in his job. But when knockout Eve Gray steps into his office, he's rattled. For the mysterious woman is a dead ringer for the heiress thought to be the latest prey of the serial killer who goes by the name Lady Killer.When Eve awoke in an Atlanta hospital, her past was a blank slate. Then she recognized her own face in the newspaper and vowed to learn the truth. Determined to confront the nightmares hidden in her mind, she never expects to find a partner in Gabe.As Gabe and Eve work together, their explosive attraction becomes irresistible. Gabe knows that his desire for Eve is growing too strong, bordering on a dangerous obsession, but nothing pulls him away from her. And when another Eve lookalike disappears, Gabe vows to protect Eve at all costs. While Eve may have forgotten the killer in her past, it's clear he hasn't forgotten her.","I actually don’t read romantic suspense very often anymore.  I used to read it slavishly but then I found I was galloping  through the story to get to the end expecting to see the Bad Guy come after the heroine and our hero ride in like a white knight and rescue her and I was skimming over the story and kind of missing the romance so I only dip my toes back in the suspense pool occasionally and when I do, I want it to be a good one.I’ve read Cynthia Eden’s Deadly series in the past and I know, as a romantic suspense, author she gives me what I’m looking for – seriously nasty and sadistic bad buys, a hot sexy romance and a highly suspenseful story and that’s what I was looking for in Broken and I definitely found it.Broken gives us not only a hot romance and a suspenseful story but also works hard at setting the scene for the rest of the LOST series, introducing us to the main characters who will no doubt star in future books and giving us a little bit of their background.  It seems all these people have something very dark in their past which has driven them to be part of Gabe Spencer’s new missing persons agency and there’s just enough here to whet your appetite to want to carry on with the series.So we have Gabe Spencer, head honcho of the LOST organisation, and Eve Gray who has survived torture and near death to wake up with no memory of what happened that day or anything before.  The only thing she knows is that she’s escaped a killer and she looks uncannily like a missing heiress, suspected to be one of the killer’s victims.  She turns to Gabe and his organisation for help and they share an incredible attraction and, once he realises that the killer is coming for again, Gabe’s protective and possessive traits come rising to the surface and he vows to keep the woman he’s falling in love with safe from the clutches of her would-be murderer.This is a highly complex, multi-layered suspenseful story with plenty of red herrings and potential suspects. Pay close attention to all the details as there is plenty of little clues out there – some to definitely throw you off the scent but some do point straight at the killer.  When he’s eventually unmasked, he was one of my suspects but I had several so I don’t think it was at all predictable.  The plot is intriguing enough to keep me reading and gathering pace as I found myself dying to find out who the killer is and I once again found myself reading just a little too fast.  I tried to slow myself down, to appreciate the growing feelings between Gabe and Eve but I found it nigh on impossible!  Suspense novels just do this to me – I just have to know!I think the mystery pretty much takes centre stage here but it’s interwoven pretty well with the romance between the two central characters and, for the most part, I really did feel their overwhelming passion and desperation at the gathering danger for Eve.  It was very well done with some truly emotional and very hot sex scenes.  I very much enjoyed it, devoured it in fact.  The Killer truly was a fucked up, sadistic bastard and I think Cynthia Eden does this type of bad guy really well.  I very much liked Gabe and his crew who will no doubt entertain us for several books to come and I look forward to reading them.  If I have any complaints, it’s that I didn’t always completely get Gabe and Eve’s connection – it seemed to come out of nowhere, a kind of insta-love but I did eventually get on board with it and start rooting for them.  A good start to what promises to be a great series.

342,Beg for Mercy,Romantic Suspense,"He lurks in the shadows, waiting and watching . . . And once he has you, all you can do is. . .Beg For MercyMegan Flynn thought she was falling in love. Cole Williams wasn't just handsome and passionate, he was one of the good guys. Or so she thought, until he arrested her brother-the only family she has left-for a murder she knows he couldn't have possibly committed. Now, with her heart broken and her brother's life hanging in the balance, Megan will risk everything to prove his innocence. Even if that means throwing herself into the path of a killer with a hauntingly familiar MO.Seattle Detective Cole Williams had given up on making Megan see reason where her brother is concerned. But when she insinuates herself into the most shockingly brutal case Cole has ever worked, he can't stand idly by. Plunged into a secret world where the city's elite indulge their darkest desires, Cole will do whatever it takes to bring down a madman who has made Megan his most coveted prey.","Wow, what a book! I'm not even going to attempt much of a review, since my head is still spinning and I'm all jumpy with too much adrenaline! The suspense in this book was just awesome--Jami Alden, you hit this one out of the park! From page one I could not put it down. Everything worked in this book, and it pushed all my buttons and hit all my switches--a perfect romantic suspense.This isn't a lightweight RS at all--it's gritty, often graphically violent, deals with prostitution, rape, and human trafficking, and will leave you anxious as our heroine tries to save her brother who's been sentenced to die by lethal injection in just over a week. She's convinced her war hero brother didn't commit the rape and murder that he's been convicted of, and she doggedly pursues every lead she can follow to clear her brother's name.I had to admire her faith in her brother's innocence and her determination to get him exonerated, even when the facts all pointed to him being guilty. She put her own life on hold for 3 years, and was the only one who believed in him. Her blossoming romance with the tough cop who ended up arresting her brother was destroyed, yet that didn't stop her. She was going to prove her beloved brother's innocence or die trying (which nearly happened)!I love how Jami Alden plotted this book, even though I had a strong suspicion who the killer was almost from the start. But that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book at all. And when she revealed the killer's backstory, darn if I didn't feel a bit sorry for him! No wonder he turned out to be such a twisted, violent sicko!This book was very reminiscent of a Karen Rose thriller, only...dare I say it? It was better! Because she also gave us a romance with some heat! The book starts out 3 years prior, when our heroine (Seattle free-lance writer/ volunteer child advocate/ aspiring social worker Megan Flynn) and our hero (by-the-book homicide detective Cole Williams) are about to 'get busy' when they're interrupted by a phone call (this happened more than once when they were about to get intimate in this story). Of course this phone call sets the whole plot in motion, since it involves a murder that Megan's brother is a part of. Cole is the arresting officer, and you can kiss his and Megan's relationship goodbye at this point. Three years later their paths cross again (during a murder investigation with striking similarities to her brother's case), and despite a lot of left over animosity from Megan, they both realize that they still have feelings for each other. Cole still thinks that Megan's brother (Sean) is guilty, but he tries to help her anyway in what he thinks is her futile search to find the 'real' killer. As Cole and Megan get closer, he starts to realize that maybe Megan is on to something--did they arrest the wrong man?Yesss, lots of nail-biting suspense in this one, lots of gruesome violence, some sexual tension that pays off nicely in some wickedly hot bedroom (and kitchen and bathroom) scenes, and a conclusion that will leave you frantically biting your nails...Hurry, Cole! When the book ended I still had a few unanswered questions, which hopefully will be answered in the next book.Awesome work--Jami Alden, I think you should write nothing but RS, and I can't wait until Hide from Evil comes out! Beg For Mercy is one of my favorite books of the year--5 big stars!",5.0
343,Hotter After Midnight,Paranormal,"A Seductive Nighttime World. . . Dr. Emily Drake's psychotherapy patients tend to be a little unusual.

344,When You Dare,Romance,"The tougher they are, the harder they fall…Professional mercenary Dare Macintosh lives by one hard and fast rule: business should never be personal. If a cause appeals to him and the price is right, he'll take the mission he's offered. But then the lovely Molly Alexander asks him to help her track down the men who'd had her kidnapped—and for the first time, Dare's tempted to combine work with pleasure.Fiercely independent, Molly vows to trust no one until she's uncovered the truth. Could the enemy be her powerful, estranged father? The ex-fiancé who still holds a grudge? Or the not-so-shy fan of her bestselling novels? As the danger heats up around them, the only anchor Molly has is Dare himself. But what she feels for him just might be the most frightening thing of all…","First impressions: Hello, pretty cover. I'd ask how you are, but I think it's fairly obvious. You're doing great. So what's going on back there, behind your beautiful abs of awesome? No, you're right. I don't really care.Lasting impressions: A smart, strong woman meets a smart, strong man and somehow both are surprised they fall in love. I'm all about the slow burn, but with this one I was snapping my fingers hoping they'd move it along. I gots thangs to do.Conflicting impressions: Dare is a mercenary, and a lot of time is spent talking about his job or watching him protect Molly, but we get snubbed when it comes to actually seeing his dare I say, daring rescue? I could pun all day with this guy.Overall impressions: It took me probably three weeks to get through this book. I would read a few chapters, put it down, then not ever really get the urge to pick it back up. I was on board with a handsome mercenary who rescues a young woman, then falls in love while trying to track down her kidnappers. If only that was the book I got.Instead, I got a really boring but handsome rich dude who says he's a killer mercenary but in reality is just dull and likes dogs. A LOT. He calls them ""his girls"" and I think that's supposed to be cute but I thought it was weird. The author wanted to make us think he had daughters by using this vague phrase. Yeah. We get it. Very clever.The book starts after the main event, which annoyed me. Dare has just rescued this woman out of the goodness of his heart while actually in Mexico to rescue his friend's sister from human traffickers. There was this extra American lying around so he just scooped her up and put her in the bin with the others. It's a good thing Lori Foster doesn't try to make Molly feel indebted to him for going out of his way to save her because that would be super extra annoying.But no. Molly feels indebted not because Dare rescued her, but because she hasn't paid him. She spends the rest of the book worrying about the expenses Dare is racking up in order to get her things like food, clothing, and shelter (the nerve!) and is so overly apologetic about being scared and seemingly weak that she drives Dare (and us) crazy.The secret is that Dare doesn't think she's crazy for being scared. He thinks she's actually handling things really well and is so impressed with how awesome and strong she is that he wants to smooch her. Instead of going all Moonstruck and slapping Molly while Cher-ily telling her to ""Snap out of it!"" he just dives in and plants a kiss on a shell-shocked recovering kidnapping victim who was beaten and starved in a Mexican shack for almost two weeks.Surprisingly, Molly reacts by wondering if she can get some more of that smooching. That pain in your eye? That's called an eyeroll sprain. You may want to go put some ice on that.The single most frustrating part of this book was that despite the somewhat forgivable back-and-forth nature of the characters' escalating feelings, the plot itself didn't really go anywhere. We come in after the exciting rescue and then spend a few hundred pages watching Molly try to build her life back up to normal, then spend the last 50 pages finding out whodunnit and watching Dare take them down in a very brief scene. Where was the danger I was promised in the summary? I wanted way more action than I got, and was disappointed with how slowly the book moved.Our main characters spent most of the book telling each other the same thing over and over again, highlighting their mutual admiration. ""You're perfect."" ""No, you're perfect."" ""You're so strong."" ""No, you're so strong."" ""I secretly love you."" ""No, I'm the one in love with you secretly."" Ad nauseam. If you can stomach the slow pace and just want to follow the romance, this is for you. If you're looking for some excitement or surprises, I wouldn't recommend it.",2.0

WOW.I almost didn't give this book a chance. I tried reading it a long time ago (twice) but I never got past the prologue. I thought I wouldn't like it.But, oh how wrong I was!Because this is, hands down, best Linda Howard's book. I will never forget it. Never.The hero and the heroine are one of the most lovable characters in the entire romantic suspense genre. How can you not love them?Milla. One of the best heroines ever. She is such a strong character. She's honest, fierce, loyal, persistent. I love her and admire her from the bottom of my heart.Diaz.
There was nothing romantic about Diaz, no murmured sweet things, no gallant gestures, just this kiss that went on and on, deep and voracious. She’d never been kissed like this before, with an intensity that stripped everything down to the simplest components: male, female. He held her with his hand burrowed into her hair, her skull gripped in his palm, her head tilted back while he fed from her mouth. That was what it felt like, a taking. And yet he gave, too.It was sex as she had never known it before, raw and powerful, surprisingly sophisticated in execution but primitive in design and intent.
He is NOT just another perfect book boyfriend. He is NOT just another hottie you forget as soon as you start the next book. He deserves a shelf of his own. He belongs to the Best Hero Ever Hall of Fame. Right next to Joe Callahan, Remington Tate, Lee Nightingale and other badassest of all the badass heroes out there. Because they are in a league of their own. Dark. Deadly. Dangerous. Stoic. Silent. Brooding. Rugged. Hot. Faithful. Devoted. Strong men. Manly men. Real men in every sense. Yum.I'm not going to lie, this book is not an easy read. It ripped my heart out. It deals with a very difficult subject matter but the author handled it beautifully. But don't worry, it doesn't deal with dead exes, love triangles or cheating and it does end with a HEA .If you’ve read Linda Howard’s books before then you already know how talented she is. But this book is written with such passion and intensity that you will never forget it for as long as you live.It is perfect style-wise, plot-wise, character-wise and length-wise.If you loved this book as much as I did, please recommend me another book as good as this one. I need more.",5.0

There have been far too many naïve virgins in this series.What I didn’t like:* What sort of a sloppy kidnapper doesn’t notice that their victim has stolen their phone from them?* What sort of a sloppy kidnapper doesn’t care when he eventually realises said phone is missing?* What sort of person rescues someone who’s been kidnapped and nearly been raped, and starts kissing them without their permission?* ‘I found myself wondering what he looked like in a uniform'really? You’ve been kidnapped, you nearly got raped, and now you're getting shot at, and you're wondering what your rescuer looks like in a uniform?

349,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
350,The Last Murder at the End of the World,Mystery,"Solve the murder to save what's left of the world.Outside the island there is nothing: the world was destroyed by a fog that swept the planet, killing anyone it touched.On the island: it is idyllic. One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death.

352,The Mystery Writer,Mystery,"A literary thriller about an aspiring writer who meets and falls in love with her literary idol—only to find him murdered the day after she gave him her manuscript to read. There's nothing easier to dismiss than a conspiracy theory—until it turns out to be trueWhen Theodosia Benton abandons her career path as an attorney and shows up on her brother's doorstep with two suitcases and an unfinished novel, she expects to face a few challenges. Will her brother support her ambition or send her back to finish her degree? What will her parents say when they learn of her decision? Does she even have what it takes to be a successful writer?What Theo never expects is to be drawn into a hidden literary world in which identity is something that can be lost and remade for the sake of an audience. When her mentor, a highly successful author, is brutally murdered, Theo wants the killer to be found and justice to be served. Then the police begin looking at her brother, Gus, as their prime suspect, and Theo does the unthinkable in order to protect him. But the writer has left a trail, a thread out of the labyrinth in the form of a story. Gus finds that thread and follows it, and in his attempt to save his sister he inadvertently threatens the foundations of the labyrinth itself. To protect the carefully constructed narrative, Theo Benton, and everyone looking for her, will have to die.","I have a habit of automatically requesting books from authors that I have enjoyed before-often without even reading the premise! Next year, I will have to be more discerning, and start reading the synopsis to determine if the particular story is REALLY a fit for me, despite past positive experiences with the author!Had I done so in this case, (and the synopsis really shares too much!) I wouldn’t have requested this book, as I know that I rarely enjoy a story about conspiracy theories or the people who believe in them. But, that wasn’t the only issue I had with this book…**Theo Benton has left the University she has been attending, convinced that her career path as an attorney is the wrong path for her, and shown up on her brother's doorstep in Kansas with two suitcases and an unfinished novel.She decides to finish her book at cafe/bar called “Benders”, which happens to already have a highly successful “writer in residence”, Dan Murdoch, who quickly becomes her mentor-until he is brutally murdered.Could his senseless death have anything to do with the Conspiracy Theories he has been researching?Was he involved or is there another agenda at work? Theo is determined to find out.Unfortunately, despite her good intentions, I could not connect with Theo, who comes across as a weepy, naive “damsel in distress” who needs continual rescuing from her brother Gus, and his friend and associate, Mac, whose family are “Doomsday Preppers”.Another issue-as written, you would believe that all Americans run around armed with a gun.In addition, despite 400 pages, the last 30% uses SEVERAL abrupt time jumps, to move the story to its denouement, making the ending feel extremely rushed. (and over the top)“After She Wrote Him” earned 4 stars from me, and “The Woman in the Library” earned 5 stars and a place on my FAVORITE READS shelf for 2022, so I am sure this is a one off and I am still looking forward to seeing what Sulari Gentill pens next.

353,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

354,Off the Air,Mystery,"Equal parts thought-provoking and entertaining, Emmy Award winning reporter Christina Estes introduces Jolene Garcia in her Tony Hillerman Prize winning debut, Off the Air .Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, splitting her time between covering general assignments―anything from a monsoon storm to a newborn giraffe at the zoo―and special projects. Stories that take more time to research and produce. Stories that Jolene wants to tell.When word gets out about a death at a radio station, Jolene and other journalists swarm the scene, intent on reporting the facts first. The body is soon identified as Larry Lemmon, a controversial talk show host, who died under suspicious circumstances. Jolene conducted his final interview, giving her and her station an advantage. But not for long.As the story heats up, so does the competition. Jolene is determined to solve this murder. It’s an investigation that could make or break her career―if it doesn't break her first.","Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, who splits her time between covering general interest assignments and working on special projects.

(Mostly the last two, but I guess that is what reporters see more of)It is also so loaded with facts about how reporting has changed over the years from just reporting a story and competing for ratings, to competing for clicks on Social Media, and racing to be the first to “tweet” a breaking story.So much so, that the story often reads more like an expose on the “cut throat day in the life of a journalist”- than as fiction-and the over abundance of facts took me out of the story, and slowed down the pace. Maybe those interested in this career might enjoy this more?Also, a negative for me-that POLITICS played a big role in the narrative.One thing I can say- when I found out what Lemmon did to get himself killed-I agreed with the PERP who declared that Lemmon got what was coming to him. 😉TRIGGER WARNINGS thoughtfully provided by the author in alphabetical order: References to abandonment, ageism, animal cruelty, child neglect, classism, homelessness, racism, sexism, sexual coercion, and substance abuse.A buddy read with DeAnn.

355,A Grave Robbery,Mystery,"Lord Rosemorran has purchased a wax figure of a beautiful reclining woman and asks Stoker to incorporate a clockwork mechanism to give the Rosemorran Collection its own Sleeping Beauty in the style of Madame Tussaud’s. But when Stoker goes to cut the mannequin open to insert the mechanism, he makes a gruesome discovery: this is no wax figure. The mannequin is the beautifully preserved body of a young woman who was once very much alive. But who would do such a dreadful thing, and why? Sleuthing out the answer to this question sets Veronica and Stoker on their wildest adventure yet. From the underground laboratories of scientists experimenting with electricity to resurrect the dead in the vein of Frankenstein to the traveling show where Stoker once toured as an attraction, the gaslit atmosphere of London in October is the perfect setting for this investigation into the unknown.

Will they unmask him in time to save his next victim? Or will they become the latest figures to be immortalized in his collection of horrors?","It's no secret that I ADORE the Veronica Speedwell series. When @prhaudio #prhaudiopartner granted me freeaccess to the audiobook of 𝐀 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐁𝐁𝐄𝐑𝐘 (PUB 03.12) early I threw all other plans aside and pressed play.I LOVE this series and this is a new favorite! I think that audio is the BEST way to experience this engaging historical mystery adventure of Speedwell and Stoker. This installment is dedicated to the audiobook narrator, Angele Masters, and her voice is masterful perfection. She has become the voice of Veronica and it's magic to my ears.(Yes- you must read them in order.)I was smiling and laughing within the first 2 minutes. I loved this installment so so much. As with any great series, I find great comfort in returning to these well-known, well-loved characters. I love seeing the character's relationship evolve. After 8 books, I was surprised to find myself swooning over Speedwell and Stoker in a fresh, new way. Tender and tenacious. Veronica Speedwell is my favorite kind of character: smart, quick-tongued, vivacious, and loyal. She knows who she is and won't sacrifice that based on anyone's expectations. She is full of moxie and gumption. I wish I could join her for a glass of aguardiente as she regales me with tales of her and Stoker's latest mystery.(P.S.- Stoker's not bad either) #speedwellandstoker4lifeDeanna Raybourn has this magical ability to bring the mystery to life through both her writing and storytelling style.

356,The Extinction of Irena Rey,Fiction,"Eight translators arrive at a house in a forest on the border of Belarus. It belongs to the world-renowned author Irena Rey, and they are there to translate her magnum opus, Gray Eminence. But within days of their arrival, Irena disappears without a trace.The translators, who hail from eight different countries but share the same reverence for their beloved author, begin to investigate where she may have gone while proceeding with work on her masterpiece. They explore this ancient wooded refuge with its intoxicating slime molds and lichens, and study her exotic belongings and layered texts for clues. But doing so reveals secrets — and deceptions — of Irena Rey's that they are utterly unprepared for. Forced to face their differences as they grow increasingly paranoid in this fever dream of isolation and obsession, soon the translators are tangled up in a web of rivalries and desire, threatening not only their work but the fate of their beloved author herself.This hilarious, thought-provoking second outing by award-winning translator and author Jennifer Croft is a brilliant examination of art, celebrity, the natural world, and the power of language. It is an unforgettable, unputdownable adventure with a small but global cast of characters shaken by the shocks of love, destruction, and creation in one of Europe’s last great wildernesses.","Jennifer Croft’s droll, brainteaser of a novel slowly shifts into the realms of the absurd. Like characters from Agatha Christie, eight translators are summoned to an isolated house on the edge of an ancient, Polish forest. Once there, their host, world-famous author Irena Rey, inexplicably vanishes, leaving her eight translators to work out what’s happened – and if it might happen to them too. The book we’re presented with is an account of their experiences and attempts to find Rey. It’s written by one of the eight - at first known only by her translation language Spanish, later as Emi. However, there’s a complication, the version of Emi’s autofictional piece on offer here is actually a translation from Polish to English. A translation carried out by English aka Alexis, another of the eight, and a character in Emi’s book. Alexis’s introduction makes it clear she considers Emi’s version of events highly suspect, casting doubt on her reliability as a narrator. But Alexis’s framing is also somewhat self-serving - since she’s obviously unhappy about her portrayal here - so could it actually be Alexis who’s unreliable? It’s a conundrum we’re left to ponder. Emi recounts the eight’s arrival at Rey’s house, she’s distraught that the once-luminous Irena now seems close to abject, apparently abandoned by her husband, and oddly tight-lipped about her new book Grey Eminence previously billed as her magnum opus. There’s a pervasive sense of foreboding, intensified by an ill-fated, expedition to nearby Białowieża Forest, a brooding, primeval place with a sinister history. The house too has a gothic feel despite its Japanese, organic design, filled with strange artefacts, it’s a veritable cabinet of curiosities. In Alexis’s translation, Emi’s style seems unintentionally amusing, mannered and bordering on archaic at times. But is this an accurate reflection of Emi’s writing or a parody that furthers Alexis’s agenda? Or could it be that Alexis just isn’t a very competent translator? Alexis muddies the waters even further by interweaving Emi’s text with detailed footnotes that veer between clarification, exasperation and outright intervention. It’s a move worthy of Borges, whose influence is detectable throughout Jennifer Croft’s novel. Borges alongside half-buried allusions to writers like Poe and Henry James, the interplay between Emi and Alexis, Emi’s excessive reverence for Rey as author of near-sacred work versus Alexis’s more pragmatic stance, all point to Croft’s underlying concerns. Croft’s intent on exploring and contesting popular notions of authorship and meaning, relations between author and translator. Croft is known for her award-winning translations, and her novel bears distinct traces of the Polish literature she’s most famous for - particularly Olga Tokarczuk’s fiction, there’s more than a hint of Gombrowicz here too. Croft challenges traditional binaries, divides between author and translator and also, through Białowieża Forest, nature and culture. Białowieża is a unique place that Croft’s visited more than once, it sustains a rich diversity of flora, fauna and wildlife, some no longer exist anywhere but there. Croft deliberately sets her story in 2017, a time when the Forest came under threat from extensive logging projects as a result of changes in government policy. Croft uses the Forest and Rey’s character to introduce wider questions around ecology, climate change and art in a time of extinction. Rey’s new book revolves around many of these issues including whether or not art is an essentially destructive force. They’re intriguing questions although not ones that Croft always fully, or entirely convincingly, addresses. Croft unites her interest in ecology and authorship by drawing on ideas circulating in literary, queer and feminist theory. She inserts a series of puzzling references and reflections on the fungi and lichen found throughout the forest - often regarded as discrete organisms, now understood as part of a collective, an inter-sustaining network of living things. Croft has dubbed translation a kind of ‘superlichen’ a process of interconnection and collaboration, embedded in a wider literary and cultural ecosystem. An understanding of translation which deeply troubles established notions of the author as celebrity or individual with a unique, authorial voice – an idea of authorship modelled by Emi in Croft’s narrative through Emi’s hyperbolic regard for Rey and her work. Croft’s novel of ideas is often entertaining and thought-provoking, but it can also be essayistic, dense and overpacked: Croft can't resist including commentaries on topics ranging from publishing culture to rising racism and xenophobia in Europe. I had mixed reactions to this one, it’s well-crafted and I admired its ambition. But it also felt a bit stretched out, overly long, and quite laboured at times – there are a number of points where the plot is too transparently operating as a vehicle for Croft’s ideas.

357,The Summer She Went Missing,Mystery,"Last summer, they searched for Audrey Covington. This summer, they'll search for the truth. Paige Redmond has always felt lucky to spend her summers in Clearwater Ridge, with lazy days sunning at the waterfalls and nights partying at the sprawling houses of the rich families who vacation there. The Covingtons are one of these families, and beautiful, brilliant Audrey Covington is Paige's best friend. And last year, when Audrey's crush-worthy brother Dylan finally started noticing Paige, she was sure it would be the best summer ever. Except Audrey didn't seem quite like herself. Then one night, she didn't come home. Though Audrey wasn't the first girl to disappear in Clearwater Ridge, she left behind more lies than clues. Now, one summer later, her case has gone cold, and nobody, least of all Paige, can make sense of what happened. When Paige stumbles across a secret hidden in Audrey's room, however, it changes everything she thought she knew about last summer. She and Dylan set out on their own investigation, discovering things even the police don't know about the people of Clearwater Ridge. But tracking down missing girls―girls who might be beyond saving by now―means entering a world far darker than Paige has ever imagined. And if she isn't careful, she'll become the next girl to vanish.","REVIEW TO COME FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME😭, I'm so behind on reviews at this point😂.",4.0

They vowed to never do it again; to stick their noses in where they don't belong, to make a podcast, none of it.Then they meet Mattie, a Freshman at their high school. Mattie shows up on the literal doorstep, begging for the girls' help with an unsettling family situation.Mattie's sister, Lola, disappeared mysteriously five years ago. The thing is, Lola has returned. She's not talking about where she has been all these years, and Mattie is convinced she's an imposter, but no one else believes Mattie; not her mother, not her brother, Luke, no one.Blair and Cam, Blair in particular, are moved by Mattie's story. They seem so passionate about it. It couldn't hurt to help them out, could it? Look into it a little...Before they know it, the two are neck deep in another dangerous investigation, but with secrets between them, how will they ever be able to get to the bottom of someone else's twisted family drama? I was intrigued by this initially, and did enjoy following Cam and Blair during the investigation. For me, it wasn't quite as compelling as the first book, but yeah, still a solid story.The audiobook has great narration and I would recommend that format. I was able to fly through this story and I did find that the narrator helped to keep me engaged, even when I was rolling my eyes a little bit.I felt like, and I could be misremembering, but for me, personal issues for Blair and Cam took much more of a front seat in this one than the first book. In a way, this almost felt like a straight YA Contemporary story, with a slight mystery happening in the background.By this I mean, the mystery almost took a back seat to Cam and Blair's interpersonal dramas. With this being said though, I do really enjoy both Cam and Blair as characters and I love their friendship. So, it's not like I was disappointed with those aspects of the story, it just seemed more difficult to get as invested in the mystery surrounding Lola because of it.Additionally, there were things at the end that I found unsatisfying; that just didn't make sense. I am mainly referring to the events following the big reveal, so sadly, I can't comment more without giving the ending away.Overall though, I still enjoyed Cam and Blair, their friendship and the idea of two smart high school girls taking on the world and solving mysteries. That's a fun concept, which is fairly well executed within these stories.There are hints that there could be more with these characters in the future. I would be interested in picking up future books, if that turns out to be the case.Thank you to the publisher, Wednesday Books and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copy to read and review.

361,To Slip the Bonds of Earth,Historical Fiction,"While not as famous as her older siblings Wilbur and Orville, the celebrated inventors of flight, Katharine Wright is equally inventive – especially when it comes to solving crimes – in USA Today bestselling author Amanda Flower’s radiant new historical mystery series inspired by the real sister of the Wright Brothers.December 1903: While Wilbur and Orville Wright’s flying machine is quite literally taking off in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina with its historic fifty-seven second flight, their sister Katharine is back home in Dayton, Ohio, running the bicycle shop, teaching Latin, and looking after the family.

It seems the patent is the least of her brothers’ worries. They have a far more earthbound concern—prison. Now Katharine will have to keep her feet on the ground and put all her skills to work to make sure Wilbur and Orville are free to fly another day.","Not only does this cozy mystery have an interesting and intriguing cover but the story is very good too. It’s like going back in a Time Machine to the late 1800s and the early 1900s.

She is a school teacher at the Steele High School in Dayton Ohio. She also does the book keeping for Orville and Wilbur’s bicycle shop. She is an extrovert with a feisty personality and outspoken nature. At the same time she is respected as a school teacher and a Bishops daughter. Kate is well educated and is loyal and dependable. She is always passed by when it comes to promotions at the school because she is a woman. Kate is a real go getter and an achiever. That’s why when one of her students got arrested for murder Kate wasn’t afraid to go all out to prove his innocence even if he was a trouble maker in the class room.This Author never disappoints This Reader. Amanda Flower is my favorite Cozy mystery Author. The book was well researched and I thought it was a delightful introduction of a new series. I always enjoy going back in history to my grandparents early years and enjoy reading about the lifestyle of that era. I thought Kate’s character was cute and mischievous. She had a knack of getting herself into trouble as you will find out when you read this book. I recommend this book to readers of cozy mystery, historical fiction and women’s fiction. This book is a clean read. To Slip the Bonds of Earth is scheduled to be released on 3/26/24.I voluntarily read an advanced readers copy of this book.

Aside from losing her sister tragically years ago, Tru has also been saddened and fascinated by the unsolved murders of two teen girls, Bailey and Celeste, and would LOVE to use the resources at her newspaper job to dig down deep into the cold cases...because there's something inside her that tells her that SHE is meant to find the truth...but 
why?
Tru is also hiding a secret from her longtime boyfriend and family...not only does she not plan to go to college with him at FSU in the fall...she's not even sure if this 'perfect' relationship feels right to her anymore. Her one solace is diving, and Tru spends a LOT of her time exploring the deep and looking for answers at the bottom of the water. Enter Rio, a fascinating, beautiful, and mysterious fellow diver, who appears seemingly out of nowhere...and forms an INSTANT bond with Tru.As the two become fast friends, their feelings start to spill into uncharted territory...and Rio reveals that she too feels a pull towards the Bailey and Celeste murders.

But when they find the aforementioned ""Don't fear the reaper"" note tacked to their tent one night, and hear terrifying sounds in the woods that same evening...it seems like the girls have stumbled upon dangerous information...information SOMEONE would kill to keep hidden. Can Tru and Rio uncover the secret of Bailey and Celeste's demise...
before they get PERMANENTLY swallowed by the deep?
There is something so theatrical and yet accessible about Ginny Myers Sain's books, and with this one as my third read of hers, I've come to expect certain qualities when 'diving' into her stories. 😉 There will be murder, intrigue, the tortured push and pull of teenage friendships (and love stories!), and an atmosphere that ALWAYS leaps off the page...and thrusts me headlong into somewhere completely unexpected...and of COURSE, also very creepy! This time, we land in sunny Florida, and there is certainly enough detail here to bring to mind the almost oppressive humidity found only in the Sunshine State. In this one, Tru and Rio (no coincidence that this is her name, I'm sure! 🌊) also spend a great deal of time on dives and underwater, and these passages also brought the dark and terrifying nature of the Deep to life...and had me holding MY breath each time they went down!Although I enjoyed these two main characters enough, I have to say in this one...I almost felt like TOO many of the 'townsfolk' had been invited to the party. Lots of the characters also have very odd or uncommon names (Derry, for example...and don't get me started on John Boy! 😣) I know we needed a SOMEWHAT larger cast to provide 'suspects' and give some depth to the plot itself, but unlike some of Myers Sain's previous books, this time I felt VERY much like I was reading teenagers...who were acting a LOT like teenagers. Of course, this is fine: this book IS YA, after all. But with so much emphasis on smoking, uh, 'alternative substances', and of course the burgeoning romances (or eroding romances) between several of the characters, it felt like there was almost too much going on at times...and yet, not the sort of events and feelings I WANTED to learn more about as we went along.And then there's of course the paranormal element that is always present in Myers Sain's books, and it WAS present here...but in a muted, downplayed way. Part of this was I think intended to keep the reader guessing (and it absolutely worked!) but I have to admit after lots of buildup and the ENTIRELY unfair and tragic death of one character that I truly liked 😢 the denouement felt like a bit of a letdown and steered sharply away from the groundwork that Myers Sain had laid and the trail of breadcrumbs I had been following...and it's hard to say that I wasn't slightly disappointed. There is also a pretty heavy emphasis on the relationship (?) or not between Rio and Tru, so if you aren't into a bit of romance in your thrillers, I would steer clear.And as to whether Tru can 'tru-ly' trust Rio?It'll be up to YOU to revisit these lyrics after reading and see if they turn out to be true!Love of two is oneHere but now they're goneCame the last night of sadnessAnd it was clear she couldn't go on😳😉4 stars, rounded up from 3.5",4.0
364,The Housemaid's Secret,Thriller,"As he continues showing me their incredible penthouse apartment, I have a terrible feeling about the woman behind closed doors. But I can't risk losing this job – not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It's hard to find an employer who doesn't ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything...That's when I make a promise. After all, I've done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

365,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars! OVERALL: SURPRISINGLY ENJOYABLE!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

 🤨Mmmmmm yeah, no. This was not good. I did not enjoy it at all, and I recommend it to nobody. Okay that’s the review, bye!!!!!Lol yeah, maybe one day I’ll be the person who can just rate and move on but today is not that day! And I am not that guy.As of now, I can see I am in the minority opinion. It wasn’t far into The Maid before I realized this wasn’t going to be a positive experience for me. But I’d like to give a shout out to Jan B’s review for bringing up a lot of things I was thinking while reading, and to Chelsea who lets me complain to her uninhibited. As a BOTM pick, a book slated for adaptation and an author who is a publishing executive, this one’s gonna have a lot of eyes on it, and I want to make sure there are perspectives present beyond the flurry of glowing reviews.The premise of The Maid is such: a hotel maid who is “different” from other people discovers the dead body of one of the hotel’s wealthiest patrons, foul play suspected. She gets further dragged into the fray and unintentionally incriminates herself, all while misreading what should be “obvious” social cues. There’s murder, money, drugs, off-page violence and ~mystery~ all wrapped in something meant to be somewhere between a cozy mystery and a genre thriller. The plot itself is fine, though nothing we haven’t seen before. Instead, what’s carrying the story is the titular Molly the Maid, set up as a lovable underdog that just gets in over her head. She works hard! She is a good person! She tries her best! And she LOOOOOVES to clean!!!!!!! Clearly this is meant to be cute and charming.But Molly is also written as neurodivergent in some never-specified way. I’ve seen a couple of weird arguments by people saying the author has not confirmed this, but she doesn’t have to. I read it; the writing is not exactly subtle. And I did not love the way she was depicted at all, to be totally honest. I can only guess that Nita Prose was trying to capitalize on that ‘quirky female main character who whoopsie-daisies her way into some trouble’ trend from like 5ish years ago. And frankly, she missed the boat. This isn’t a fresh, compelling character idea—and in the case of The Maid, it wasn’t even well done.Listen, I understand the intent behind a character like this. I’m not saying it’s necessarily offensive, but it sure as hell isn’t cute. And the idea of a gaggle of privileged, upper-middle class book club women reading and gigging at a character like Molly being framed for murder because she ‘doesn’t understand how people work’ makes me feel kind of weird. Molly appears as a caricature, dreamed up by someone who’s only exposure to ND people has been Rain Man and Eleanor Oliphant. As others have noted, Molly’s qualities aren’t very consistent. They wax and wane depending on the need of the story. She doesn’t understand what a rumba is or can’t tell if someone is smiling or not, but then is effectively spouting off complex behavioral analysis a few chapters later. The situations she finds herself in are beyond ludicrous, and the way she inevitably gets out of them even more ridiculous. And Molly isn’t the exception to bad characterizations. Every single other person, from the villain(s), to the fumbling police, to the rest of the hotel staff—are all cartoonishly portrayed. There’s probably more subtext I’m missing, with the two additional POC maids and the undocumented kitchen employee (I’m sorry, where is this supposed to take place again? The UK?? Is there a large number of undocumented Mexican immigrants working at British hotels that I’m unaware of???). Because this book isn’t about the challenges of operating in a neurotypical world or the difficulties of navigating a new country while undocumented, but instead those are just secondary stumbling blocks on the road to figure out who murdered this rich white guy. And I don’t feel as though Molly and Juan Manuel were treated with care, but instead a kind of passive cruelty.That said, the biggest offense for me though? This was boring as hell. I couldn’t read more than a dozen or so pages at a time, despite how short it was. I have genuinely no idea how or who chooses which mystery/thrillers to acquire, let alone adapt, but they need to have the company checkbook taken away immediately. Anything present in the story that was out of the ordinary was equal parts absurd and dumb, and anything remotely passable has been done a thousand times already. Seriously someone, anyone, clue me in to what was so compelling about this meditation on why ‘ummm service workers actually LOVE cleaning and waiting on our every whim?!’ with a side helping of murder. I’m literally begging you. I’ll refrain from ending spoilers even though I don’t think it’s worth reading, but that big ‘twist’ was so obvious while also being completely unnecessary. It cheapened every bit of plot up to that point, though by then it was mostly a lost cause for me. one additional note: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT ASSISTED SUICIDE ““TWIST””?!? EXCUSE ME.Anyways, someone please call Florence Pugh’s agent and have her pull out of this ASAP. I’m having war flashbacks of Maddie Ziegler and Kate Hudson in Sia’s MUSIC. 😐*Thanks to Random House - Ballantine for the advance review copy!**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!",2.0
368,A Flicker in the Dark,Thriller,"When Chloe Davis was twelve, six teenage girls went missing in her small Louisiana town. By the end of the summer, Chloe’s father had been arrested as a serial killer and promptly put in prison. Chloe and the rest of her family were left to grapple with the truth and try to move forward while dealing with the aftermath.Now 20 years later, Chloe is a psychologist in private practice in Baton Rouge and getting ready for her wedding. She finally has a fragile grasp on the happiness she’s worked so hard to get. Sometimes, though, she feels as out of control of her own life as the troubled teens who are her patients. And then a local teenage girl goes missing, and then another, and that terrifying summer comes crashing back. Is she paranoid, and seeing parallels that aren't really there, or for the second time in her life, is she about to unmask a killer?In a debut novel that has already been optioned for a limited series by actress Emma Stone and sold to a dozen countries around the world, Stacy Willingham has created an unforgettable character in a spellbinding thriller that will appeal equally to fans of Gillian Flynn and Karin Slaughter.","I almost always give even the shittiest books at least two stars because the author I'm bashing wrote words and got them published. Good job. However, given that the story has already been optioned by Emma Stone, I don't think the author will be weeping into her labradoodle's fur over my piddly little review. So, fuck it. ONE STAR.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD""Psychology,"" I said. ""I'm hoping to pursue my PhD here next fall - then, eventually get my master's."" Reader, my eyes closed in pain. I'd like to call this an editorial error, but I think the main character is actually this stupid. I have a master's degree. I also have a doctorate. Which one do you think came first - the doctor designation, or the dusty, useless piece of paper my mom put in a frame? Hmm.Where to even start with this book? Chloe Davis, the human equivalent of hold music, is very deeply damaged. She's the daughter of a notorious serial killer, and she's done everything she can to separate herself from that life. Those efforts include the following: not changing her name, moving an hour away from her hometown, giving an interview on how her serial killer father inspired her career, ETC. Girlfriend, have you heard of Google? Everybody knows you. Your Ken-doll fiancé - yeah, you didn't have to reveal nothing, because other people know how the internet works.Yep, let's discuss Ken-doll: he throws you surprise parties even though he knows you freak out about everything. He unilaterally decides to throw in a little surprise choking during some nice, relaxing morning sex. (Didn't your father's victims die by choking? Huh. Tacky). Dude disappears all the time and you never really bother to ask where he is or what he's doing. Sounds super great. A nice healthy relationship. At least you can call in prescriptions in his name! (Apparently psychologists can do that in Louisiana --solidifying the decision to set the book here, because this girl would have never made it through medical school).Elevator music drug and alcohol problem: Look, I realize I'm more Hunter S. Thompson than most, but this D & A problem ain't really that bad. I work with lawyers and criminal defendants, and ALL of us are taking benzos legally or illegally and in much higher quantities than Princess Chloe here. You're worried ONE xanax is going to muck up your day? If you're really an addict, you'd have to take half the bottle to even notice you took anything. Two glasses of wine after a xanax, and you wake up not remembering what happened? Two xanax and you lose a DAY AND A HALF? This is some amateur shit right here. Our girl talks about having done all of this since college (10-12 years?) -- this is your tolerance? LEAVE THIS PARTY RIGHT NOW. Some other random thoughts: they find Valium in the first victim's hair follicles approximately two seconds after they find the body. What coroner on what earth is looking at a hair follicle test first thing? Those things take days to process in a best case scenario. They would use a blood test, a vitreous fluid test, maybe even a urine test if there was any remaining. I've sat through enough expert witness testimony to feel personally affronted by this scene. This inattention to detail covered the entire book. I understand we don't all need to know the science. But if you don't have the science, you need the characters. Ergo, if there is neither science nor character, you have a fucking snoozer, my friends. Who even needs the Xanax at this point. SHE SLEEPS WITH THE FAKE REPORTER MURDERER. God! Was the choking the day before not enough? Also, there was chocolate on a pillow at a Motel 6? Laugh out loud. This is like Blair from ""Gossip Girl"" trying to write ""poor.""Then, revelation time. Chloe has solved this puzzle! The dang murderer is obviously taking these girls to Chloe's childhood home. She also apparently used to know him, because he's from her home town. EYE ROLL. She is going to drive right to the house and not tell anyone about it. She is also going to leave her phone in the car because why would you need that? (Aside: a famous serial killer's house has been sitting empty for 20 years and it's somehow completely intact, not vandalized, burned down...?) In what world?Well, thankfully Dr. Brilliant Chloe remembers to take the gun into the house, even though she's never shot a gun in her life. Earlier in the book, she even rues the fact. ""Golly gee, I should really learn to shoot this thing."" But, in this perfect moment, the benzos have steadied her hands, and she shoots that dumb fucker reporter lover murderer right in the fatal spot. Deus ex 9mm.But, of course that's not the end, because the killer from 20 years ago was Chloe's weirdo brother. Did that surprise a single person who read this? The serial killer sitting in jail never actually did it, duh. Turns out those porno mags Cooper kept in his room really pushed him over the edge. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE. Cooper feels the darkness, he says. Yeah, dude. We all feel the fucking darkness. Take this bottle of xanax and work it out.The ending is Chloe arriving at her former(?) fiancé's sister's house. She drove to Mississippi to return the ring (certified mail anyone?), but she doesn't actually want to talk to Ken-doll. In retrospect, and aside from not asking permission for the choking, he wasn't so bad. He's a pharmaceutical rep and she's a drug ""addict."" Match made in heaven, DUH.Chloe's dad gets out of jail because, also, DUH. My only emotional response to that was that everyone should watch the show Rectify and forget they read this stupid fucking book. If my kid was murdering people, you better believe I wouldn't take a murder rap for that little psycho!

369,Cut and Thirst,Short Stories,"Myrna, Leonie, and Chrissy meet every Thursday to sample fine cheeses, to reminisce about their former lives as professors, and lately, to muse about murder. Decades ago, a vicious cabal of male poets contrived—quite publicly and successfully—to undermine the writing career, confidence, and health of their dear friend Fern. Now, after Fern has taken a turn for the worse, her three old friends decide that it’s finally time to strike back—in secret, of course, since Fern is far too gentle to approve of a vendetta. All they need is a plan with suitably Shakespearean drama. But as sweet and satisfying as revenge can be, it’s not always so cut and dried.","I thoroughly enjoyed this short story featuring three retired professors who meet weekly to reminisce about their lives and careers over cheese and their beverage of choice. Their discussions turn to the topic of one of their common friends, Fern, a writer who was targeted in a coordinated effort instigated by a fellow writer to ruin her literary career years ago. The friends believe that this incident created a situation that exacerbated her declining health. We follow them as they go about devising a plan to avenge their friend (who is unaware of their intentions). As they weigh their options with meticulous precision, it soon becomes evident that framing and executing a foolproof plan might prove to be a tad more complicated than they had anticipated.Touching upon themes of aging, friendship, loyalty, revenge and professional jealousy Cut and Thirst by Margaret Atwood, is a quick entertaining read. I loved the banter between the friends (strong Golden Girls vibes!). With sharp dialogue, more than a few laugh-out-loud moments and interesting characters, this short story is perfect if you’re looking for a palate cleanser or just a good laugh in between more serious reading.

370,All Good People Here,Mystery,"Margot Davies was six at the time, the same age as January—and they were next-door neighbors. In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist, but she’s always been haunted by the fear that it could’ve been her. And the worst part is, January’s killer has never been brought to justice.When Margot returns home to help care for her sick uncle, it feels like walking into a time capsule. Wakarusa is exactly how she remembered: genial, stifled, secretive. Then news breaks about five-year-old Natalie Clark from the next town over, who’s gone missing under eerily similar circumstances. With all the old feelings rushing back, Margot vows to find Natalie and solve January’s murder once and for all.But the police, the family, the townspeople—they all seem to be hiding something. And the deeper Margot digs into Natalie’s disappearance, the more resistance she encounters, and the colder January’s case feels. Could the killer still be out there? Could it be the same person who kidnapped Natalie? And what will it cost to finally discover what truly happened that night?In the propulsive debut novel from the host of the #1 true crime podcast ""Crime Junkie,"" a journalist uncovers her hometown’s dark secrets when she becomes obsessed with the unsolved murder of her childhood neighbor—and the disappearance of another girl twenty years later.","Hmm…semi-satisfying -I was so close to love this book but that abrupt ending gave me second thoughts- review is coming up!True crime and podcast elements, tight knitted- conservative- nosy small town theme and two girls’ brutal murder investigations collide the past tragedies into present kind of intriguing plot line: were the strengths of this story!  Margot Davies who returns her hometown Wakarusa after 20 years where the brutal murder of her neighbor girl and her childhood best friend January Jacobs has scandalized the entire community and haunted the reputation of Jacobs family whose members keeping secrets that torn them apart. Margot is journalist and she returns to take care of her fifty years old uncle Luke who was the only father figure for her when her father failed at this job. As soon as she comes back, murder case of Natalie Clark shakes the neighbor town Nappanee! Townies of Wakarusa already start criticizing the situation and another vandalizing attack happens at Jacobs’ front walls just like twenty years ago when their daughter has been kidnapped and killed.  Even though she’s sacked from her job at the newspaper because of emergency situation her uncle created has prevented her to write a good article about the murder investigation, she is adamant to dig out more to bring out the skeletons townies his in their closets which mean she also has to dig out her own past, learning secrets about her own family. The book’s progress is extra slow burn after the strong opening. The chapters were a little dragging. Because of the interesting topic I kept on reading and I was about to round up 3.5 stars to 4 but that abrupt, weird ending which force us fill the blanks to write our own ending was semi satisfying for me! Unfortunately I cut the half star and I decided to give three solid, it’s not very good but it’s still okay read stars!  I’m still interested in reading more future works of the author. It was still a promising start!

371,The Paris Apartment,Mystery,"She’s broke and alone, and she’s just left her job under less than ideal circumstances. Her half-brother Ben didn’t sound thrilled when she asked if she could crash with him for a bit, but he didn’t say no, and surely everything will look better from Paris. Only when she shows up – to find a very nice apartment, could Ben really have afforded this? – he’s not there.The longer Ben stays missing, the more Jess starts to dig into her brother’s situation, and the more questions she has. Ben’s neighbors are an eclectic bunch, and not particularly friendly. Jess may have come to Paris to escape her past, but it’s starting to look like it’s Ben’s future that’s in question.The socialite – The nice guy – The alcoholic – The girl on the verge – The conciergeEveryone’s a neighbor. Everyone’s a suspect. And everyone knows something they’re not telling.","Meh. The Paris Apartment feels mostly like melodramatic dithering, but I guess I was somewhat entertained.Jess needs a place to stay, so she hits up her half brother. When she arrives at his residence, she finds a fancy building with questionable tenants, but no sign of Ben. As she digs deeper and asks around, she starts to realize that all is not as it seems at this apartment building. Dun dun dun!Having read a few of Lucy Foley's books, I feel like she's really good at building up anticipation. Every moment in this book is so dramatic, with dark shadows and scary sounds at every turn. That's all good, but after a while, it gets to be a bit much, you know? There's no natural ebb and flow in the tone. It's just all high anticipation, all the time.It doesn't help that every character acts so high-strung and paranoid, even when nothing is happening.
I watched as Nick's friend plucked a sprig of rosemary from one of the bushes, tearing hard to wrench it free. How he crushed it to his nose, inhaled. There was something presumptuous about the gesture. It felt like an act of vandalism.
What the heck. Who attacks a bush just to smell it? And who watches someone do that and calls it ""presumptuous""? Reader, if you're able to keep from rolling your eyes, you're a better person than I am.For a book advertised as a mystery, it sure doesn't feel like one. Jess doesn't so much suss out clues as she bumbles around, pilfering stuff, sticking her foot in her mouth, and just generally acts like an incompetent idiot. The other characters are all unlikable too, though each in their own way. And everyone is smelly, with stale breath and excessive sweat.After all that exaggerated writing, do the twists deliver? Eh, they seem pretty standard to me for the genre. I wasn't really surprised or shocked. In fact, it feels more ridiculous than anything else.Still, I was compelled to turn the pages, so I must've been somewhat entertained by all the antics.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Guest ListThe Hunting Party~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
372,Toxic Prey,Mystery,"Gaia is dying.That, at least, is what Dr. Lionel Scott believes. A renowned expert in tropical and infectious diseases, Scott has witnessed the devastating impact of illness and turmoil at critical scale. Society as it exists is untenable, and the direct link to Earth’s death spiral; population levels are out of control and people have allowed disarray and disorder to run rampant. While most are concerned about deadly disease, Scott knows that it is truly humanity itself that will destroy Gaia. It’s only by removing the threat then the planet can continue to prosper, and luckily, Scott is just the right man for the job…When Scott then disappears without a trace, Letty Davenport is tasked with tracking down any and all leads. Scott’s connections to sensitive research into virus and pathogen spread has multiple national and international organizations on high alert, and his shockingly high clearance levels at various institutions, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, make him the last person they’d like to go missing. As the web around Scott becomes more tangled, Letty calls in her father, Lucas, help her lead a group of specialists to find Scott as soon as possible. But as Letty and Lucas begin to uncover startling and disturbing connections between Scott and Gaia conspiracists, their worst fears are confirmed, and it quickly becomes a race to find him before the virus he created becomes the perfect weapon.","It’s been a while since population explosion and control has been at the heart of any thriller I’ve read. But in this, the 34th Lucas Davenport book, a scientist has decided the only way to save the planet is to significantly reduce the number of people living on it. Lionel Scott has spent his career studying infectious diseases, how they spread and the ability to make them more infectious. Now, he’s gone missing. In truth, the book is a Letty and Lucas story and Letty is at the forefront in the action. Lucas and Rae are brought in because of their ability to hunt down people. The book moves along at a brisk clip as the team tries to outthink the villains. For me, it’s important that thrillers stay on this side of the believability line. This one does that, especially given our recent experience with Covid. It works well to have a high level of tension, but with the inevitable downtime. Sandford realizes that even action heroes need to eat and sleep. The action is all within the realm of the possible. Sandford’s writing style is such that it’s easy to envision every scene. I also liked that Sandford has toned Letty down so she’s not some super girl character she displayed in her earlier books. Unlike some of Sandford’s other books, there’s not a lot of humor here. And while this is part of a long standing series, it can be read as a stand-alone. My thanks to Netgalley and Putnam Group for an advance copy of this book.",4.0

In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her.

374,The Family Upstairs,Thriller,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. The can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.","3.25 confused, restless, is it fair enough to give lower points because you’re die-hard fan of Lisa Jewell fan question flying over my head, creepy, oh those guests should urgently get the hell out of the house stars!  Personally, honestly, I love this author’s work starting from “Watching you”, “Then she was gone”, “I found you”. She is the master evil queen of thrillers taken place in creepy houses and the characters formed in dysfunctional families who have unresolved issues.  So this book is one of them. I enjoyed the prologue. I felt all the goose-bumps on my arm, sweat dripping down my forearm, shivered uncontrollably. My intellectual appetite increased and my level of curiosity hit to the top.  Plot was intriguing: Unwanted and never-leaving guests occupied house and their numbers increased every day till they completely turned into an ominous, cursed and chilling cult, whose members wear ugly shapeless black clothes, chose organic style diet by famishing children. And we met David and Birdie, they’re one of the creepiest couples as like Natural Born Killer’s “Mickey and Mallory”, or any adopted children of Woody Allen and him.  Those parts of the book about Henry, who is probably younger version of Dexter, undiscovered sociopath who hides his unconditional love for Phin, captured my attention. His mother who is about to lose the rest of her marbles, his passive and obedient, weak father and his sister who is suffering from puberty crisis and uncontrollable occupation of CREEPY GUESTS who became THE REAL OWNERS of the house were remarkable and well-rounded characters. The thing I didn’t like and found confusing is way of 3 POV-ed story telling. I got the writer’s motive to put a bridge between past and future and connect three main characters’ stories, mash them in harmony. But the parts are too detailed and you started to feel like you’re drifting apart the main story, the creepy, disturbing guest part and dive into too many details about the other characters’ lives. There are so much enough materials on this book to write two other ones.  Till we reach the encounter of characters and combination part of their stories we may already solve their mystery. Being two steps ahead of the writer doesn’t make me happy!  So I wished we only read about the house’s past, rising of cult, Henry’s searching about paganism and his slow but expected move to the dark side. We already have David and Birdie to be shaken to the core.  The ending of the book was nice touch made me give extra 0.25 stars but I still expected more from this writer and as soon as I saw this book on my dashboard and screamed ( not for seeing my morning self in the mirror, for finding out NetGalley provided me the book, it was one of the happy and joyous screams) and the beginning excited me but the pacing got slower in the middle. It was still good written, detailed, riveting book. Lisa Jewell is one of the best story tellers I’ve ever seen and as a hopeless fan, I will keep happy screaming before starting her upcoming books. But this time, this book didn’t work so much for me!Special thanks to Atria Books and Netgalley to send me this ARC COPY and lighten up my day in exchange my honest review.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",3.0
375,Apples Never Fall,Fiction,". .If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.","I've got to hand it to Liane Moriarty. Just when I think I've seen it all, she comes along and completely surprises me with this sparkling and startling gem of a tale.Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, has disappeared. Her adult children are rightfully aghast, but they're reluctant to report her missing. Because they know the prime suspect will be their father, and they're not really sure of his innocence. When the police start asking questions, it quickly becomes clear everyone in the family has stories to tell and secrets to hide. And before it's all over, everything will be revealed and laid bare.I've really been enjoying stories about dysfunctional families lately, and this is such a superb one. The four siblings are all trying to figure out if their father could've really murdered their mother, and if so, which side would they be on? It's a fascinating premise, and the progression of the story captures all of the nuanced facets that this dilemma would bring to the family.What I've always admired about Moriarty's writing is her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. She has this ability to peel back the layers of family relationships and what it means to be human, and to expose everything ugly and beautiful within, while injecting just that right dose of humor. This book hits upon tender subjects that everyone would recognize as familiar, yet instead of making me cry, it made me laugh.Needless to say, I found this whole thing to be utterly riveting and unputdownable. The characters are memorable, the strife feels all too real, and the dialogue is snappy. I devoured it in just a few days. While the mystery isn't the core of this book, there were still plenty of revelations along the way that kept me surprised and delighted.Liane Moriarty is back! This seemingly simple tale of dysfunctional families and relationships, of people's flaws and the messiness of their lives, of unmet expectations and unspoken dreams, hit all the right notes for me. It feels like Moriarty's last two books have been a little bit off of her true form. But with this one, she again returns to the pinnacle of her craft.My heartfelt thanks for the advance copy that was provided for my honest and unbiased review.",5.0

WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!i have put off writing this review since reading the ARC back in MARCH because i didn't want to poop on anyone else's pre-release anticipation with my less-than-glowing reaction, but now that it's been out for a bit, i'm gonna let my poop out, too. stand back.i didn't get around to reading The Silent Patient until The Great Lockdown of 2020, and it was just the twistyfun distraction i needed from the world, so when i heard that his follow-up was going to be a campus thriller involving seeeeecret societies, classical mythology, and a sinister professor, my The Secret History-loving self was SO EXCITED, and the marketing campaign leading up to its release kindled alla my dark delicious anticipation. and yet.it's just...look, i hate being that guy, but it's just not very good. i'm pretty reasonable about managing my expectations when it comes to summertime psych-suspense thrillery books; they don't gotta be art, they just need to hold my interest and maybe throw a surprise or two my way. escapist entertainment is fine, but i don't like being insulted, and that's what this felt like.QUICKPLOT: mariana is a psychotherapist specializing in group therapy who is still hard-grieving the drowning-death of her beloved husband the previous year. she reluctantly returns to the memory-saturated college campus where their love story began to console her niece/adopted daughter-figure zoe after her best friend tara is found murdered. zoe suspects one of the professors of killing tara, and, encouraged by her former mentor, mariana decides to stick around and do some amateur sleuthing, during which time more girls are murdered. meanwhile, mariana is being low-key stalked by one of her patients from back home, and she meets a younger man who claims to be psychic and is convinced they have a romantic future together, because visions. my first gripe was with the structure. each chapter is about three pages long, which speeds up the pace and prevents the reader from becoming fully immersed in the story—we're just skimmed along through the plot points at a pace seemingly designed to camouflage the fact that there's no development happening; that this is more like an outline of a mystery novel than one fully-realized.the immersion problem is made worse by the frequent insertions of psych-stuff; these clinical asides breaking up the flow:Accompanying the housekeeper on shopping trips to the crowded and frenetic market in the center of Athens always made Mariana nervous. And she was relieved, and a little surprised, to return home unscathed. Large groups continued to intimidate her as she grew older. At school, she found herself on the sidelines, feeling as if she din't fit in with her classmates. And this feeling of not fitting in was hard to shake. Years later, in therapy, she came to understand that the schoolyard was simply a macrocosm of the family unit: meaning her uneasiness was less about the here and now—less about the schoolyard itself, or the market in Athens, or any other group in which she might find herself—and more to do with the family in which she grew up, and the lonely house she grew up in.on the very next page:Mariana grew up with a keen awareness of [her mother's] loss. As a therapist, she knew a baby's first sense of self comes through its parents' gaze. We are born being watched—our parents' expressions, what we see reflected in the mirror of their eyes, determines how we see ourselves. Mariana had lost her mother's gaze—and her father, well, he found it hard to look at her directly.i have a problem with that inserted ""well,"" voice-wise, but the bigger problem is the decision to develop a character thru psych 101 notes. it's...inelegant. i understand that she's a therapist and what she does is bound to inform who she is (which again opens up that whole can of worms re: voice), but these details just don't work in chapters this short; they're not well-integrated into the story, they distance the reader from the character and there's no opportunity to settle back in before we're off to the next chapter. in fact, a lot of this book feels like the author is shoehorning in details from his own personal cache of 'stuff he knows about,' without regard for their narrative utility: psychotherapy, the beauty of the greek islands, greek mythology, the greek language. these recurring motifs take up a lot of real estate at the expense of other story elements, like character development, and they don't do much to enhance the larger story. because here's what's not in his personal cache of 'stuff he knows about:' creating believable characters.NONE of the characters are believable, every interaction is fraught, written as though accompanied by a very intense and cheesy b-movie musical score, everyone all sticky with malice and foreboding. suspend all disbelief, ye who enter here. so. zoe believes professor edward fosca killed tara, claiming that they were having an affair and that, when tara threatened to expose their relationship, fosca threatened her right back and hours later, she turned up dead.edward fosca is a byronically handsome american professor specializing in greek tragedies (natch) who seems to only teach the prettiest girls on campus; several confident, intelligent girls known as the maidens who have formed a tight-knit little secret society based on the persephone myth, and whose education is frequently conducted by fosca in private sessions featuring drugs and alcohol and wild parties but it's not a harem at all, oh no, he's just the light these 20-year-old girlmoths collectively named after virginal ingenues gravitate towards and it's all perfectly normal academia. tara was one of the maidens, but neither fosca nor any of the other young women except zoe seem especially broken up over her death. to contrast grief-responses: mariana is clutching and weeping over her dead spouse's sneakers fourteen months after his death, but an inner-circle maiden dies and the next day these ladies are just fine and dandy, cool and snarky. now, you may well ask yourself why no one would give a little wait, what? about a female-student-collecting prof drinking behind closed doors with all these pretty little maidens, or find the optics of professor mcdreamy striding across campus trailed by an entourage of girls in flowy white dresses on their way to a memorial service...ill-advised? no objections at all, because on this campus, *shrug*, that's just how students learn. when mariana was matriculating, she developed a relationship with her (female) advisor that continues to the present-day, but began with the same kind of boundary-blurring: Most of the teaching...was done on a one-to-one basis, between fellow and student, usually taking place in the fellow's rooms. At any time after midday, or even earlier, at the discretion of the fellow concerned, alcohol was invariably served...providing an education in drinking as well as literature.It also meant that tutorials took on a more personal flavor, and lines between teacher and pupil became blurred—confidences were given, and intimacies exchanged.speaking of exchanged intimacies, fosca is eventually fired because he was, in fact, sleeping with ALL of the maidens. WHAT A COMPLETE SHOCK, SAID NO ONE. maybe shoulda looked into that before the bodies started dropping.mariana may understand that sometimes teachers and students drink together in private rooms and that's a totally normal part of the education process, but she trusts zoe's instincts about fosca's guilt, and he's certainly not acting unshady. cue dialogue:""I can see you have cast me as the villain—a predator preying on my vulnerable students. Except now you're met these young ladies, you can see there's nothing vulnerable about them. Nothing untoward happens at these meetings—it's just a small study group, discussing poetry, enjoying wine and intellectual debate.""""Except now one of those girls is dead.""Professor Fosca frowned. There was an unmistakable flash of anger in his eyes. He stared at her. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?""Mariana looked away, embarrassed by the question. ""No, of course not. I didn't mean—""""Forget it."" He took another drag of his cigarette, all anger apparently gone. ""The word 'psychotherapist,' as you know, comes from the Greek 'psyche,', meaning 'soul,' and 'therapeia,' meaning 'healing.' Are you a healer of souls? Will you heal mine?""""No. Only you can do that.""Fosca dropped his cigarette onto the path. He ground it into the earth with his foot. ""You're determined to dislike me. I don't know why.""i am determined to dislike them both because of how poorly they are written. that dialogue—yeesh. it's contrived and melodramatic and just bad. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?"" really, michaelides? and then the old tonal switcheroo from melodrama to etymological mansplaining her profession to her? you can practically see the red-pen arrow promising ""authentic dialogue TK.""mariana is why we can't have nice things in the 'strong female character' department. i get that she's raw and marinating in grief, borderline hysterical with nostalgia and (figurative) ghosts, but she's impossible to root for. she does not come across as the intelligent, educated woman we are assured she is. while she's able to spew chonks of textbook psych-evaluations about those around her, they come across as reflexive; knee-jerk assessments without any real insight into human behavior. she's in a perma-fog, she responds emotionally in every situation, she misreads every room. she's a poorly drawn caricature: the grieving widow/meddling sleuth that all the men fall for even though it wasn't until sebaaaaastian that she ever felt beautiful blah blah blah. anyway, the guy she thinks is a murderer invites her to dinner at his place and she accepts:Fosca smiled. ""Good...My rooms, at eight? And one more thing—""Before she could stop him, he leaned forward—And he kissed her on the lips.It only lasted a second. By the time Mariana could react, he had already pulled back.Fosca turned and went through the open gate. Mariana heard him whistling as he walked away.She brushed away the kiss with her fist.How dare he?She felt as if she had been assaulted—attacked; and that he had won somehow, succeeded in wrong-footing, intimidating her.what on earth was that? that And one more thing— like he's a predatory columbo.  it's a power move out of a gothic melodrama, complete with the wilting female victim, and whistling? really? that whole scene is so...silly. okay, that covers structure and characters, so i guess plot is next? mariana's involvement in this investigation beggars belief. she is asked by her former advisor to assist in the investigation because 1) she is a group therapist, and the school is like a group, and 2) she used to go to the school. neither of these are qualifications for murder-solving, an elderly professor has no authority to deputize her onto the case, and mariana has a conflict of interest cluttering up her tunnel-vision, but no matter—she agrees and begins conducting her own interviews with various parties, slipping into the deceased's room and pawing through her stuff, hiding in shadows and spying on students and tagging zoe in on her amateur sleuthery, against the protestations of the actual police, whose case she is most definitely compromising. in fact, on page 73 the chief inspector attached to the case tells her to keep out of the investigation, which warning comes before she's even begun her actual snooping. mariana's dubious contributions to the investigation are superfluous—the authorities have already called in a renowned forensic psychologist to consult—a man with whom mariana is acquainted, who light-flirts with her and allows her to sit in on his suspect interviews. because all of this is how things work. i suppose we're meant to see this ignoring-police-mandates stance as plucky? determined? but she stumbles over clues and evidence on her merrily misguided crusade without looping in the people who actually know what they're doing until you just wanna shake her. where i lost my mind was when mariana is led to the location of the murder weapon by a non-police person, and it doesn't even occur to her to object when they remove it from its hidey-hole. i know she's not a professional with a responsibility to preserve evidence, but oh we just allow people to grab murder weapons now, do we? mariana? COME ON, MARIANA!but the real issue i had was with the reveal of whodunnit and why. the motive is dumb, the whole unfurled scope of the murder plot even dumber; an overcomplicated rube goldberg machine built on interlocking assumptions, wishful predictions, and magical thinking from a wholly unqualified strategist. there are at least five things about it that MAKE NO SENSE and the whole thing left me spluttering with outrage. seriously, ____ (proper noun) killed ___(pronoun) ______ (all-caps noun, two words) even though the whole reason for the murder was moot? you don't countermand that plan and find a different way? and ____ (proper noun) didn't recognize ANYTHING from ____'s (proper noun) life in that ___ (noun)? presumably, before ____ (proper noun) went all ______ (disparaging slang), they'd ______ (verb, past tense) about their _____ (noun, plural)?? no?and ____ (proper noun) waited _____ (period of time) before deciding to get ____(adjective)? and ____(verb, past tense) _______ (proper noun) for (noun)? even though _____ (series of facts we are told at the beginning that contradict motive and some math that may or may not be accurate?????????????)and don't get me started on the psychic love-interest. ""I have a gift for that sort of thing, you know—runs in my family—foresight, premonitions. I see things others do not.""so, he's psychic enough to see the future when it involves cartoon bubble-hearts, but he doesn't see ____ (proper noun) ___ (gerund) on the ____ (noun) as he ____ (verb, present tense) by, either IRL or in a vision? a psychic character is silly enough, a psychic character with so many blind-spots is narratively purposeless. and THEN—there's a nice little The Silent Patient connection, but he ruins the moment by bashing the reader over the head with it a couple more times to make sure we noticed, lessening the effect of the shared world, and it left me with the same bad-taste reaction as the similarly-shaped ending of Split, which tie-in-reveal is the only cool thing in an otherwise terrible film. the idea of a group therapist investigating a man who has nurtured a little cultlike group around him is rich with possibility, and the juxtaposition between fosca's ladygroup with henry in mariana's therapy group was so promising: As soon as any group establishes itself, it always arouses envy and attack—and not just from forces on the outside, those excluded from the group, but also from dark and dangerous forces within the group itself. but the execution is so weak—subplots fizzle out, lackluster red herrings (henry-ings?) are dropped unexplored in order to deliver the most ridiculous explanation of all time with no regard for the tradition of fair play in mystery novels. i could do this all day—i haven't even touched upon the postcards, or the on-the-nose focus on revenge tragedies, but i've already gone on so long here that i'm running out of review-space, despite cutting out so many tirade-tangents i don't even know if what's left of the review makes sense anymore, and i've spent so much time rereading chunks of the book to make sure i'm not missing anything that makes the book make sense, and i'm just getting hot and cranky and i want this to be over. this book is getting a lot of positive reviews, and i'm happy for those readers who enjoyed it, but i can't help wondering if maybe the ARC-version i read went through extensive revisions before its final draft because what i read doesn't feel like the product of a three-years-writing-and-revising follow-up to a runaway-success debut novel. The Secret History? more like weak-ret history. *********************************got a postcard in the mail yesterday...directing me to a website with this message: and i cannot wait. three cheers for intriguing marketing strategies!!!come to my blog!",2.0
379,And Then There Were None,Mystery,"First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting.**In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last.
“Be sure thy sin will find thee out.”
Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid. This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? 
“Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.”
If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None, it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies.Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.",4.0
380,Murder on the Orient Express,Mystery,"Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the famous Orient Express in its tracks as it travels through the mountainous Balkans. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year but, by the morning, it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.One of the passengers is none other than detective Hercule Poirot. On vacation. Isolated and with a killer on board, Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.","I’m pretty astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but “early-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime” doesn’t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it’s completely cool ok???Let’s discuss the very limited number of things I won’t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you’re a detective too, and if that’s not the dream I don’t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don’t, I’d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn’t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I’m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie’s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That’s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people’s individual psychology. That would’ve upset me, probably, if it weren’t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written! I could’ve replaced this whole review with those adjectives and been much more convincing.---------------pre-reviewTHAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING!(I hope you read that in Aziz Ansari's voice.

381,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Fiction,"Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and entertainingly atmospheric novel.","I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0
382,Gone Girl,Fiction,"This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 9780307588371Who are you?What have we done to each other?These are the questions Nick Dunne finds himself asking on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary when his wife Amy suddenly disappears. The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him. He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his computer shows strange searches. He says they weren't made by him. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone.So what did happen to Nick's beautiful wife?","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0

I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
385,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
386,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,Mystery,"Agatha Christie's debut novel was also the first to feature Hercule Poirot, her famously eccentric Belgian detective. A refugee of the Great War, Poirot has settled in England near Styles Court, the country estate of his wealthy benefactor, the elderly Emily Inglethorp. When Emily is poisoned and the authorities are baffled, Poirot puts his prodigious sleuthing skills to work. Suspects are plentiful, including the victim’s much younger husband, her resentful stepsons, her longtime hired companion, a young family friend working as a nurse, and a London specialist on poisons who just happens to be visiting the nearby village. All of them have secrets they are desperate to keep, but none can outwit Poirot as he navigates the ingenious red herrings and plot twists that contribute to Agatha Christie's well-deserved reputation as the queen of mystery.Librarian's note: the first fifteen novels in the Hercule Poirot series are 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920; 2) The Murder on the Links, 1923; 3) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 1926; 4) The Big Four, 1927; 5) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 1928; 6) Peril at End House, 1932; 7) Lord Edgware Dies, 1933; 8) Murder on the Orient Express, 1934; 9) Three Act Tragedy, 1935; 10) Death in the Clouds, 1935; 11) The A.B.C.

Each novel, play and short story has its own entry on Goodreads.","""Dear me, Poirot,"" I said with a sigh, ""I think you have explained everything! And how wonderful of you to wait until page 230 to finally shed light on all your absurd behavior throughout the book, and to justify and the red herrings and narrative padding! But of course, it could only be so in the classic style of a fiendish murder mystery! Why, in fact, though this is but the first case we have solved together, I have no doubt we could do the exact same thing as many as 86 more times, depending on if you count the smaller cases!""""Quite so, mon ami,"" Poirot chuckled.

387,The Silent Patient,Thriller,"A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0

Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose?Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.","What a marvelous, delectable read! There was something so addictive about this book; it felt at times distinctly young adult while also having moments that felt so well done it was beyond the stereotype of what a teenage thriller tends to be. It’s taken me 4 days just to collect my thoughts to the point that I can attempt writing a proper review, and I’m certain this will be one of the most talked about books in the YA genre this Spring/Summer season. My issues with this book were minor, and I’ll get to those later, but when I first picked up this book I knew I would enjoy it based on the description stating “Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars”, two things I love to pieces. While this was in some ways a traditional whodunnit, I believe many of the minor influences were the reason this novel reads so well.According the the books I’ve logged on Goodreads, I’ve managed to read over 700 mystery, thriller, and suspense novels. That is an overwhelming number of books that tend to be fiercely judged on their ability to provide a solid, mind-blowing twist. The reason I mention this is due to the fact that it is very difficult for me to pick up a mystery and not have it solved in the first 10% if the clues are provided; otherwise, I typically pick it up when said character is first introduced into the narrative. One of Us Is Lying is bound to be one of many fabulous novels that gets thrown into that category and is scrutinized solely by it’s ability to keep the reader guessing “whodunnit” until the big reveal. Again, I mention this because I think it would be a grave mistake for the reader to be so focused on this aspect when the book has so much more to offer! Personally, I had it figured out in the first chapter. As stated in the summary, the pieces are there for the reader to put together if they are clever enough. I applaud the author for her cleverness and storytelling abilities; there will be many readers who will be fooled by the red herrings and receive that glorious 
AHA
 moment at the big reveal. Why am I rambling on about this you ask? I really want to drive home the point of what makes this book stand out from others that are similar.The Characters. It is a rare day indeed that I find fleshed out, grounded, relatable characters that draw me in to a young adult narrative the way that these did here. My 
AHA
 moment may not have come during the big twist, but it certainly came in waves abounding throughout my experience journeying with these various high school kids. I was sure this would be another read with those stereotypical teenagers that give contemporary YA novels a bad rep; for crying out loud the stereotypes are printed on the inside of the book cover in the description! I think this was a clever move by the publisher and author; if other readers pull the same underestimation as I did, they will be more than pleasantly surprised at what they get out of this book. In referral to the wrapping up of characters and not the twist, the ending was one of the best I’ve seen in awhile. There is no gag worthy happily ever after where everyone is perfectly paired up in couples and they ride off into the sunset on their baby unicorns while the sun beats down on their pimple free faces…. No, while there are some upbeats moments, the ending is messy and real and I welcomed it whole heartedly. People made mistakes beyond the central narrative and there were consequences and some things were left open-ended in the way that makes you wonder what their eventual decisions lead to. I’m extremely pleased that the author chose to take some risky leeway with her writing direction and applaud her with a standing ovation.Alright, I said I would get to the minor issues and I kind of lied. Please don’t hate me, but there was a tiny aspect of this book that I thought I could get past, and even though I can’t discuss it outright (because these spoilers involve blowing the entire plot of the book), my conscience just wouldn’t let me finish this review without mentioning them in the broadest of terms. Again, I applaud the author for tackling some really tough issues and concerns in this book, and I don’t think she wrote anything wrong on her end. I think it’s more of an issue I’ve seen present itself across a wide number of YA books recently. Some who may be dealing with mental illness may perceive the outcome of this novel in an unrealistic way and I can see the possibility of various readers being split on their opinions of some of the content presented. I will say, I feel it was handled better in this book than in others I have read previously. As always, if you’ve read this book early or once you have a chance to read it and would like to discuss, please feel free to private message me and I’ll gladly have a respectful chat with you.This is a review I’ve been struggling to write for a few days now and I hope I’ve done it justice. There just aren’t words to describe how completely readable this book really is. McManus did such a fabulous job of making me just as interested in the individual secrets and side stories of the “Murder Club” as I was in the central mystery surrounding Simon’s death. The author had me convinced that this couldn’t possibly be her debut novel, and if this is what she has published first, I can only imagine the treats we will receive in written form from her down the road. I’m a committed fan now and I can’t wait to see what she publishes next. Highly recommended to teens, sure, but I think loads of adults are going to enjoy this one as well. There’s something really special and unique to this story that defies the boundaries of age gaps and will have me remembering it for months to come.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy; it was a pleasure to post my honest thoughts here.",4.0

The Written Review
 Read this one for TCE book club! 
 If this isn’t hell, the devil is surely taking notes.
Lord and Lady Hardcastle are throwing a ""party"" at Blackheath, their crumbling British mansion.This so-called-party takes place on the anniversary of their son's murder (19 years ago), includes the exact same guests as it did so many years ago.And, during the night, trusts will be violated, truths will be exposed and above all, their daughter, Evelyn Hardcastle will be murdered.Aidan Bishop, along with two others,  are in competition to be the first to discover Evelyn Hardcastle's murderer.
Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded.
Bishop relives the night of Evelyn's murder for eight days, and each day he is in a different body and has a new chance to find the murderer. 
Life doesn’t always leave you a choice in how you live it.
The first day, Bishop wakes up in Dr. Sebastian Bell's body, without a clue as to where he is and what he is supposed to do.The second day, Bishop wakes up in the butler's body...but ""past-Bishop"" is also inhabiting Bell's body. Which leads to a lot of confusion and surprise.The third day, there's current-Bishop, past-Bishop and past-past-Bishop....well you get the point. Each day Bishop adds another ""character"" under his belt. He gets eight bodies, and eight days, to piece together the mystery. The two others who are in competition with Bishop are unknown to him and are also inhabiting bodies (though, unlike him, they cannot swap and every ""day"" their memories reset). They are all racing to find out the murderer, because whoever can figure out this mystery is the winner.And the winner? 
The winner gets to escape.

How lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?
This book was confusing in the best way possible.I could barely write my summary - there's just so many layers of complexity and betrayals and everything.So effing impressed. I was wholly ensnared by the mystery - I hardly knew what to think or where to look - but it was such a fun and wild ride that I didn't care.Aiden Bishop was a wonderfully fleshed-out character and Turton did a particularly excellent job with the various bodies that Bishop possessed.In particular, I loved how each body Bishop possessed would begin to influence him. When he was Dr. Sebastian Bell, Bishop was meek, under the butler's influence Bishop became moralistic and so on. It was fascinating to watch how that played out.The only thing that threw me slightly was the end. The build to the climax and the ending were superb...but the actual grand reveal was a bit of a letdown.I honestly don't know what I as expecting, just something a bit ""more"" - if that makes any sense...All I know is that this is an author to watch. 
I cannot wait to see what Turton writes next!!

We are never more ourselves than when we think people aren’t watching.

390,The Cuckoo's Calling,Mystery,"After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, famously fell to her death a few months earlier.

If you are looking for reviews that confirm what you are already certain of (that JKR can do no wrong) here are some examples of positive reviews for you - 1, 2, 3. 2) I used some Mary Poppins gifs to make my point in this review. It seemed funny at the time. If you find MP gifs stupid/annoying/beneath you, then please feel free to go to the reviews I linked before. 3) I will no longer reply to comments saying I am stupid or didn't get it. I will no longer reply to insults of any kind or condescending suggestions that I read the book again. If you're tempted to write something like this, save both of us some time and read the previous comments for my answers to people like you. I have way too many unwatched episodes of Law & Order to entertain trolls any longer.4) I'm sorry to all the people who have been kind and respectful, whether they agreed with me or not. You can just ignore these points.____________________________Things you should know: 1) Ms Rowling filled my childhood and early teen years with magic. I love Harry Potter and I confess to only adding this book after I found out she was the author. 2) I did not go into this with the intention to compare it to Harry Potter. I did not expect magic or wizards and I fully anticipated this being very different to the HP books. 3) I have read and enjoyed many mystery/crime novels in the past. My favourites being by Tana French and Gillian Flynn. So, there was no reason why I couldn't have enjoyed this book simply because it wasn't magical Potterland. But I didn't and, after putting a lot of thought into this, I think I finally understand why.Here's the sad truth: I can't stand Rowling's writing when she writes for adults. I actually find it painful to read. Let's be clear from the beginning, I started and never finished The Casual Vacancy because the opening didn't grab me and there was something about it - something which I couldn't put my finger on - that made it an effort to get through. A certain style to the writing which didn't agree with me. I thought perhaps it was a one-off because I'd read all her other works and never had a problem with her writing style. That's why I jumped at the chance to try another adult book by Rowling and sort out what was evidently a bout of silliness on my part. What this book did give me was an answer to why neither of Rowling's adult books worked for me.Rowling writes in an unusual manner. It's not unique to her work for adults, Harry Potter has it too, but the effect had on both is very different. Rowling's style of writing, including the dialogue between characters, is formal to the point of being old-fashioned. Part of me wants to compare it to Austen but I'm cautious of doing so because of the amount of people (usually including myself) who might read that as a compliment. Rowling's formal style doesn't work, for me, when using it in an adult mystery and pairing it with profanity and grisly murders. It feels out of place and weighs down each page with tedious descriptions that use too many awkward similes, metaphors and adjectives. ""...face the colour of corned beef...""""...the snow fell with soft fingertip plunks...""""...long-snouted cameras...""Her descriptions all felt a bit off to me. And I particularly didn't like the unsophisticated use of big words. It's like when inexperienced indie authors go crazy with thesaurus.com, using clunky words like ""exacerbated"" and ""exorbitant"" in casual sentences that don't benefit from it. The characters in this book never check the time or look at their watches, they ""consult"" their watches. Think I'm being picky? Try reading whole pages where every sentence replaces the obvious words with complex ones and see how far you get without your brain starting to scream. And it felt like every single noun had at least one adjective before it. Not only that, but Rowling repeats similar adjectives when referring to the objects again. In one sentence, we are told she climbed the ""steel stairs"" and in the next she's continuing up the ""metal stairs"". WHY???? And also WHYYYYYY???Another example of Rowling's old-fashioned style is her frequent use of expressions like ""oh my!"" and ""goodness!"", expressions I'm sure some of you will recognise from Harry Potter characters. What is this? It's like Mary Poppins or Little Women or, I don't know, Little House on the Prairie. And maybe it works fine in all of those, same as it works fine in Harry Potter, but none of those also had a side-helping of profanity and very adult themes. They do all, however, share the formal language style.And while I think people were silly to say things about The Casual Vacancy like ""ohmigod this had, like, noooooo magic and even fewer dark lords"" when Rowling clearly said it was an adult mystery book and I wanted to say to those silly people:I still think it's entirely relevant to compare the two when looking at Rowling's writing style and the reason why sometimes it works and sometimes it really doesn't. The formal tone with simplistic language - like in Harry Potter - is okay, but dense descriptions and over-complicated sentences made it hard work and tedious in this book. It's like a very formal letter with the occasional random swear word thrown in. And it doesn't work. Not for me, anyway. The style simply doesn't fit the content; there's swearing and murders and people rescuing others by grabbing their breasts...I'm not even going to talk about the story beyond saying I found it a standard mystery that could have been good if I'd not had these other reasons for not liking it. The killer is not hard to guess for anyone familiar with crime mysteries but that isn't usually what I care about most in crime mysteries anyway. Plus, in this case, I'm just too blinded by my dislike for the writing. *sigh* I think it's fair to say that I'm finally done trying to enjoy Rowling's adult books.P.S. Yes, I did get a little overexcited when I googled Mary Poppins gifs.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",1.0
391,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,Mystery,"Considered to be one of Agatha Christie's greatest, and also most controversial mysteries, 'The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd' breaks the rules of traditional mystery. The peaceful English village of King’s Abbot is stunned. The widow Ferrars dies from an overdose of Veronal. Not twenty-four hours later, Roger Ackroyd—the man she had planned to marry—is murdered. It is a baffling case involving blackmail and death that taxes Hercule Poirot’s “little grey cells” before he reaches one of the most startling conclusions of his career.Librarian's note: the first fifteen novels in the Hercule Poirot series are 1) The Mysterious Affair at Styles, 1920; 2) The Murder on the Links, 1923; 3) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, 1926; 4) The Big Four, 1927; 5) The Mystery of the Blue Train, 1928; 6) Peril at End House, 1932; 7) Lord Edgware Dies, 1933; 8) Murder on the Orient Express, 1934; 9) Three Act Tragedy, 1935; 10) Death in the Clouds, 1935; 11) The A.B.C. Murders, 1936; 12) Murder in Mesopotamia, 1936; 13) Cards on the Table, 1936; 14) Dumb Witness, 1937; and 15) Death on the Nile, 1937. These are just the novels; Poirot also appears in this period in a play, Black Coffee, 1930, and two collections of short stories, Poirot Investigates, 1924, and Murder in the Mews, 1937. Each novel, play and short story has its own entry on Goodreads.","I went into this book with a bit of an attitude. Roger Ackroyd is the only Agatha Christie book featured on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, and I was skeptical about the List's claim that this was the only Christie book worth reading. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I think the List is right on this one. At least a little - I'm definitely not suggesting that you should read this book and then never pick up a Christie novel ever again, but if you find yourself in a situation where you're going to spend a month on a desert island and can only bring one book, and the only books you've been offered are from the Agatha Christie canon, you should pick this one. The ending (which I will not discuss in explicit detail for fear of spoilers) is what makes this a 5-star book. Let me assure you: you will not guess who the murderer is. Never ever ever. When the murderer is revealed, you will not believe. When the murderer goes on to explain his/her actions, you will continue to not believe it. Only by rereading certain important passages will you start to realize that the answer was in front of you all the time, and you couldn't see it. It's a testament to Christie's skill as a writer that this is accomplished. And, having now read a Miss Marple mystery, I'm going to choose a side: I'm officially Team Hercule. He is silly and self-centered and ridiculous and funny and all I want to do is pinch his cheeks and then go sit in a cafe with him and eat croissants. My favorite part of the book is when Poirot makes his grand entrance. The narrator, Dr. Sheppard, is in his garden when someone throws a vegetable marrow over the wall. A second later, the doctor's new neighbor pokes his ""egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes"" over the garden wall and attempts to explain himself:""I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense. For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I enrage myself with the marrows. I send them to promenade themselves - alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.""",5.0

393,The Inheritance Games,Mystery,"Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why -- or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch -- and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a conwoman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.","THERAPY!!! THERAPY FOR ALL OF YOU! my thoughts (mild spoilers ahead)• i ain't never seen four emotionally intelligent brothers. two of them always gotta have unaddressed trauma.• the young adult threshold for personality is in HELL. all you need to do is give your teenage main character a vaguely tragic past, enough stubbornness to allow her to mildly bump heads with love interests every once in a while, a weakness for hot emotionally unavailable rich boys, and a best friend of color to carry things (for flavor).• not this billionaire secretly surveilling a low income teenage girl for most of her adolescence while she's struggling to stay afloat and literally living out of her car? taking and saving photos of her without her knowledge? and hoarding his wealth all the while? while she's barely scraping by? until the day he dies and finally decides—now that he no longer needs that wealth—it'll all go to her in exchange for using her as a pawn in his family's trauma olympics? GUILLOTINE!• LIKE? ARE YOU DERANGED? JUST HIRE A FAMILY THERAPIST? YOU LITERALLY HAVE EVERY RESOURCE AT YOUR DISPOSAL?• i clocked the endgame from the moment the hawthorne brothers were introduced, which is always irritating, because love triangles only really work (at least for me) when there seems to be a genuine struggle to decide between two equally interesting, three dimensional characters. • not to get into semantics, but if faced with a choice between two rich white boys, why NOT PICK THE ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIST? WHO IS GENTLE AND FORGIVING? AND WASN'T PLAYING A BULLSHIT HOT AND COLD GAME WITH AVERY'S HEART BECAUSE HE IS EMOTIONALLY UNHINGED WITH THE MENTAL MATURITY OF A 13 YEAR OLD GTA GAMER?• this is how all of jameson and avery's interactions went:""can you point me to the bathroom?"" i asked.""he who leaves the game, loses, heiress,"" he said.""please, i really have to pee, can you just—""""the ball always looks for the best player,"" he replied with the glint of a grin, cutting me off.""jameson, please—""""play alone and you’re bound to win, mystery girl.""• THIS MAN DID NOT HAVE A PERSONALITY. HE WAS JUST A TRENCH COAT OF FORTUNE COOKIE QUOTES. FLEXED HIS ABS A LITTLE AND CALLED IT A DAY. • the amount of times the narrator repeats lines of dialogue verbatim in her head did in fact give me a migraine. • xander was the best brother—a puppy, if you will—and i stand by that.• this was textbook young adult in that i could feel the plot mechanics moving as i zipped through the pages. the inheritance games is very much a predictable ""mystery"" that ended up slowed down by the tediousness of a love triangle i still don't really buy.• HOW OLD IS AVERY? are we ever gonna ask that? because she's interacting romantically with adult men as a minor? just wondering hehe• on that note, this concept would have been so much better if the characters were all college-aged. imagine the shock, the intrigue, the comedy of a low income, jeff bezos-hating college student with loans out the ass suddenly coming into billions? and having to live with two hot white guys? this concept is a lot funnier than it was written. buying into a high school girl solving a billionaire's years-long puzzle and catching the attention of the 18 + 19 year old brothers while she's at it is just a bit too much of a stretch, even for ya.• i also can't get over the whole emily subplot. this book was literally just....avery: Mf's be in relationships with their dead cheating Gf for like 3-5 years 😒 like damn other ppl wanna date you too 🙋‍♂️❗️😂🤣 and for most of the novel, that is exactly how jameson and grayson act. then 75% in, jameson suddenly changes his tune and goes the whole ""i actually don't care about emily at all despite constant references to and comparisons between you and her” route. like, okay, buddy. having said all of that, yes, i will be picking up book two for gay ally and HoC (Hawthorne of Color) xander.",3.0
394,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0

If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.",Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...,2.0
397,The New Couple in 5B,Thriller,"Rosie and Chad Lowan are barely making ends meet in New York City when they receive life-changing news: Chad’s late uncle has left them his luxury apartment at the historic Windermere in glamorous Murray Hill. With its prewar elegance and impeccably uniformed doorman, the building is the epitome of old New York charm. One would almost never suspect the dark history lurking behind its perfectly maintained facade.At first, the building and its eclectic tenants couldn’t feel more welcoming. But as the Lowans settle into their new home, Rosie starts to suspect that there’s more to the Windermere than meets the eye. Why is the doorman ever-present? Why are there cameras everywhere? And why have so many gruesome crimes occurred there throughout the years? When one of the neighbors turns up dead, Rosie must get to the truth about the Windermere before she, too, falls under its dangerous spell.","Wow! ""666 Park Avenue"" meets ""Rosemary’s Baby"" with spine-tingling supernatural vibes! Lisa Unger takes us on another heart-throbbing journey into the paranormal and psychological thriller realm, transporting us to a claustrophobic residence in Manhattan. Here, murders, suicides, and jaw-dropping scandals haunt the place along with its creepy occupants, including an extra-creepy doorman who seems like he never sleeps, always watching and listening. Welcome to Windermere, a haven for creative souls such as artists, writers, performers, and, of course, sensitive occultists like mediums and astrologers. These eccentric inhabitants have lived in the same location for decades, appearing at least twenty years younger than their actual ages, prompting theories about possible vampiric tendencies. But I won't give away any spoilers; you'll have to read to test my far-fetched, silly theory!Enter the happy yet financially struggling couple, Rosie and Chad Lowan, who hit the jackpot when they inherit Chad’s late uncle Ivan’s Windermere apartment. However, Ivan’s only daughter Lana is far from pleased, appearing at their apartment out of nowhere, throwing threats to sue them and casting doubt on Chad's innocence. Despite the initial challenges, Rosie sees the positive side: a $5 million apartment and the opportunity to interview her new neighbors about the dark history of Windermere, becoming the subject of her new true crime novel. The Park Avenue residence, with its grisly murders, suicides, and terrible accidents, becomes the backdrop for Rosie's investigation. The history of the building, its unique architecture, and the fact that it was built on the site of a burned-down church all captivate Rosie like a moth to a flame.However, as they move in, Rosie senses that Windermere has its own sinister soul, slowly penetrating her skin. She keeps seeing a young boy who disappears when she turns her back, and the doorman, Abi, seems to know everything about their lives, even daring to lie to make Rosie question her sanity. Sudden deaths around them make Rosie question her past life, having run away from occultist parents who believed she had powers to see the future and other entities that nobody could conjure up. As the thin veil between reality and illusion fades away, Rosie realizes that nobody close to her is as innocent as they seem. Moving into Windermere might put her life in danger. Can she run without looking back? Can she save herself? The occult vibes, including devil eye pendants, astrology seances providing insight into the Taurus sign, ghostly appearances, and a family of dreamers and healers, hooked me easily. This riveting page-turner with multiple ongoing incidents keeps you on your toes, pushing you to make sense of it all. There's an ongoing murder investigation, unexplainable incidents in Windermere, and thankfully, the reasoning behind all these events is explained as rationally as possible, avoiding far-fetched and clichéd revelations. The only thing that bugged me a little was the dragging ending, which rubbed me the wrong way. It was still tragic, but I wished Rosie’s character could be more rational as a talented, investigative true crime author. That's why I deducted one star from my rating, even though I fell in love with the gothic atmosphere and the meeting of occult vibes with paranormal elements. I'm giving it four stars, and I have to admit my heartfelt gratitude to dear Lisa Unger for sending me a physical and signed copy of her new creation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm looking forward to reading her next works in the near future.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0
398,Where Sleeping Girls Lie,Mystery,"It’s like I keep stumbling into a dark room, searching for the switch to make things bright again. To make me remember. But the switch isn’t there. Was it there before?Sade Hussein is starting her third year of high school, this time at the prestigious Alfred Nobel Academy boarding school. After being home-schooled all her life and feeling like a magnet for misfortune, she’s not sure what will happen.

Or for people to think she had something to do with it.With rumors swirling around her, Sade catches the attention of the most popular girls in school – collectively known as the ‘Unholy Trinity’ – and they bring her into their fold. Between learning more about them - especially Persephone, who Sade finds herself drawn to - playing catch-up in class, and trying to figure out what happened to Elizabeth, Sade has a lot on her plate. It doesn’t help that she’s already dealing with grief from the many tragedies in her family.And then a student is found dead.The more Sade investigates, the more she realizes there’s more to Alfred Nobel Academy and its students than she realized.

399,Good Half Gone,Thriller,"With no evidence to go on but a few scattered memories, the case quickly goes cold.Now an adult, Iris wants one thing—proof. And if the police still won’t help, she’ll just have to find it her own way; by interning at the isolated Shoal Island Hospital for the criminally insane, where secrets lurk in the shadows and are kept under lock and key. But Iris soon realizes that something even more sinister is simmering beneath the surface of the Shoal, and that the patients aren’t the only ones being observed…","What in the actual hell? I must first tell you that this whole book plays out with little suspense until the last 20% of the book. The beginning had a fantastic start, only to take a few left turns. Okay…..The story starts where Iris Walsh is on a call with 911. She just witnessed her twin sister’s kidnapping right in front of her eyes. Years later she is traumatized from the events that unfolded that night. She just can’t get over the disappearance of her twin sister, Piper. What happened to Piper and is she still alive? Determined to do her own investigating, and with years of school behind her, she takes an internship at a state hospital on an island. Why? The man she believes is responsible for Piper’s disappearance and or possible murder has been sentenced there. Iris is so obsessed for answers that she will stop at NOTHING to get them. Sounds juicy, right? I was hopeful too….. only to be taken down a long distracting road. This story starts bringing in other plot lines that really didn’t do much for the story. Yes, we learn Iris and Piper had a shitty drug fueled mother….. life wasn’t fair. Then we take a tour of some possible romance that I really couldn’t care less about. Then we have the strong willed grandmother who has raised these girls, only to find out Gran is hanging on a thread with her health. Finally, that ENDING TWIST…. Pfffffff. What? Nope, doesn’t work for me, sorry folks. 😳😳😳I wanted suspense and a brain teaser and that just wasn’t in the cards. After The Wives and this one, Fisher just isn’t for me. However, many people love her and maybe so will you. I’d like to thank Harlequin Trade Publishing, NetGalley, and Tarryn Fisher an ARC. All opinions are my own.

401,The Princess of Las Vegas,Mystery,"A Princess Diana impersonator and her estranged sister find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of money and murder in this twisting tale of organized crime, cryptocurrency, and family secrets on the Las Vegas strip.Crissy Dowling has created a world that suits her perfectly. She passes her days by the pool in a private cabana, she splurges on ice cream but never gains an ounce, and each evening she transforms into a Princess, performing her musical cabaret inspired by the life of the late Diana Spencer. Some might find her strange or even delusional, an American speaking with a British accent, hair feathered into a style thirty years old, living and working in a casino that has become a dated trash heap. On top of that, Crissy’s daily diet of Adderall and Valium leaves her more than a little tipsy, her Senator boyfriend has gone back to his wife, and her entire career rests on resembling a dead woman. And yet, fans see her for the gifted chameleon she is, showering her with gifts, letters, and standing ovations night after night. But when Crissy’s sister, Betsy, arrives in town with a new boyfriend and a teenage daughter, and when Richie Morley, the owner of the Buckingham Palace Casino, is savagely murdered, Crissy’s carefully constructed kingdom comes crashing down all around her. A riveting tale of identity, obsession, fintech, and high-tech mobsters, The Princess of Las Vegas is an addictive, wildly original thriller from one of our most extraordinary storytellers.","This had a very strong start that quickly became bogged down by a dumb as a box of rocks MC, and an unrealistic foster child who is a brilliant child prodigy. The crypto currency and mobster side plots bored me to tears. The direction the book would take was telegraphed from the beginning: A Princess Di look-alike who has a residency in Las Vegas? A sister who looks just like her, who gets involved in a shady cryptocurrency deal? Predictable, but the ending was so convoluted my eyes glazed over. This was a buddy read with Marialyce, and sadly, not one we’d recommend.",2.0
402,The Unquiet Bones,Thriller,"When human bones are found beneath an old chapel in the woods, evidence suggests the remains could be linked to the decades-old case of missing teen Annalise Jansen.Homicide detective Jane Munro—pregnant and acutely attuned to the preciousness of life—hopes the grim discovery will finally bring closure to the girl’s family. But for a group of Annalise’s old friends, once dubbed the Shoreview Six by the media, it threatens to expose a terrible pledge made on an autumn night forty-seven years ago.The friends are now highly respected, affluent members of their communities, and none of them ever expected the dark chapter in their past to resurface. But as Jane and forensic anthropologist Dr. Ella Quinn peel back the layers of secrets, the group begins to fracture. Will one cave? Will they turn on each other?The investigation takes a sharp turn when Jane discovers a second body—that of the boy long blamed for Annalise’s disappearance. As the bones tell their story, the group learns just how far each will go to guard their own truth.","Too Many Characters3.5 stars “Our lives are written into our bones.”The Unquiet Bones  is a mystery about the remains of a body found buried under a chapel at a ski resort connected to a 15-year-old girl who went missing 47 years ago.47 years ago, Annilese Jansen went missing after attending a party. Her immediate friends are thrown into the spotlight, and the media dubs them the Shoreview Six.In the present, bones are recovered under a chapel in the woods. Sergeant Jane Munro is assigned the case. Jane, who is 6 months pregnant, is also going through a trauma as her fiance went missing 6 months ago.MANY POVs are included , including all 6 members of the Shoreview Six: Rocco, Jill, Cara, Bob, Mary, and Claude. In addition, there is Jane’s POV, Annilese’s sister, a journalist, and about three to four others. Some POVs are shared late in the game, while others are steady throughout. Because there are so many characters, it is hard to connect, as their POVs are limited. Some only share one chapter, but Jane, Angela, and various members of the Shoreview Six dominate. I had trouble keeping track of who was who, and the many characters overcomplicated the simple plot. The timeline alternates between the present and 1976. In addition to the mystery of the bones and Annalise’s disappearance, there is also the mystery of another high school student who disappeared at the same time as Annalise. The mystery behind Jane’s missing fiance isn't resolved, and I can see her showing up in another book.The mystery is intriguing, but the pacing is slow. I was a little bored in the beginning due to the number of characters, and it takes time for the plot to move, but the pace eventually builds, as does the tension. The final chapters and reveal are difficult and uncomfortable to read and made me sick to my stomach (see the TW below). The ending is impactful and left me a little shaken. Overall, this book does come together, but it would have made more of an impact with fewer characters and more development.

403,Baby X,Science Fiction,"When any biological matter can be used to create life, stolen celebrity DNA sells to the highest bidder–or the craziest stalker–in this propulsive thriller.With a vivid imagining of the future, Gattaca meets The Ones in Kira Peikoff’s Baby X .In the near-future United States, where advanced technology can create egg or sperm from any person’s cells, celebrities face the alarming potential of meeting biological children they never conceived. Famous singer Trace Thorne is tired of being targeted by the Vault, a black market site devoted to stealing DNA. Sick of paying ransom money for his own cell matter, he hires bio-security guard Ember Ryan to ensure his biological safety.  Ember will do anything she can to protect her clients. She knows all the Vault’s tricks–discarded tissues, used straws, lipstick tubes–and has prevented countless DNA thefts. Working for Thorne, her focus becomes split when she begins to fall for him, but she knows she hasn’t let anything slip–love or not, his DNA is safe. But then she and Thorne are confronted by a pregnant woman, Quinn, who claims that Thorne is the father of her baby, and all bets are off.   Brilliantly plotted and terrifyingly prescient, Baby X is an unpredictable and relentless speculative thriller perfect for fans of Blake Crouch.","Check out all my reviews on: 
The Book Review Crew Blog
3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
404,The Mystery Writer,Mystery,"A literary thriller about an aspiring writer who meets and falls in love with her literary idol—only to find him murdered the day after she gave him her manuscript to read. There's nothing easier to dismiss than a conspiracy theory—until it turns out to be trueWhen Theodosia Benton abandons her career path as an attorney and shows up on her brother's doorstep with two suitcases and an unfinished novel, she expects to face a few challenges. Will her brother support her ambition or send her back to finish her degree? What will her parents say when they learn of her decision? Does she even have what it takes to be a successful writer?What Theo never expects is to be drawn into a hidden literary world in which identity is something that can be lost and remade for the sake of an audience. When her mentor, a highly successful author, is brutally murdered, Theo wants the killer to be found and justice to be served. Then the police begin looking at her brother, Gus, as their prime suspect, and Theo does the unthinkable in order to protect him. But the writer has left a trail, a thread out of the labyrinth in the form of a story. Gus finds that thread and follows it, and in his attempt to save his sister he inadvertently threatens the foundations of the labyrinth itself. To protect the carefully constructed narrative, Theo Benton, and everyone looking for her, will have to die.","I have a habit of automatically requesting books from authors that I have enjoyed before-often without even reading the premise! Next year, I will have to be more discerning, and start reading the synopsis to determine if the particular story is REALLY a fit for me, despite past positive experiences with the author!Had I done so in this case, (and the synopsis really shares too much!) I wouldn’t have requested this book, as I know that I rarely enjoy a story about conspiracy theories or the people who believe in them. But, that wasn’t the only issue I had with this book…**Theo Benton has left the University she has been attending, convinced that her career path as an attorney is the wrong path for her, and shown up on her brother's doorstep in Kansas with two suitcases and an unfinished novel.She decides to finish her book at cafe/bar called “Benders”, which happens to already have a highly successful “writer in residence”, Dan Murdoch, who quickly becomes her mentor-until he is brutally murdered.Could his senseless death have anything to do with the Conspiracy Theories he has been researching?Was he involved or is there another agenda at work? Theo is determined to find out.Unfortunately, despite her good intentions, I could not connect with Theo, who comes across as a weepy, naive “damsel in distress” who needs continual rescuing from her brother Gus, and his friend and associate, Mac, whose family are “Doomsday Preppers”.Another issue-as written, you would believe that all Americans run around armed with a gun.In addition, despite 400 pages, the last 30% uses SEVERAL abrupt time jumps, to move the story to its denouement, making the ending feel extremely rushed. (and over the top)“After She Wrote Him” earned 4 stars from me, and “The Woman in the Library” earned 5 stars and a place on my FAVORITE READS shelf for 2022, so I am sure this is a one off and I am still looking forward to seeing what Sulari Gentill pens next.

405,The Angel of Indian Lake,Horror,"Since then, her reputation, and everything around Indian Lake, has changed dramatically. There’s a lot of unfinished business in Proofrock, from serial killer cultists to the rich trying to buy Western authenticity. But there’s one aspect of the savage history of Proofrock, Idaho, no one’s got the mettle to confront – no one except a final girl, making her last stand, this time for everything.New York Times bestselling author Stephen Graham Jones has crafted an epic horror trilogy of generational trauma and stolen hope. It’s the story of the American West written in blood. And it’s the story of one girl who doesn’t know how to give up.","The Angel of Indian Lake is the final book in the Indian Lake Trilogy. It's also my most anticipated release of 2024.I finished this a week ago and have been sitting with my thoughts ever since. I find myself thinking of the story at random times during the day, and trying to decide how I would explain my overall experience with this trilogy.I really haven't come up with anything that I think serves it justice. At this point, I've come to terms with the fact that this is just one of those 5-star reads that I may never end up writing a full, thoughtful, and analytical review for.It simply is what it is. I love this series with my whole heart. It's special to me, because in a way, I feel like this series validates my passion for the crazily nuanced genre of Horror.Stephen Graham Jones is such a talented storyteller. His nostalgic, yet edgy-style, brings a distinct voice to his stories, while also bringing heart and emotion. We swoon.While I recognize this trilogy won't be for everyone, for the people it is for, for the people it resonates with, it's truly a gift. My heart hurts that it's over. Is this really the last time I'm going to spend with these characters I love?I know I can read it again and again, as I do with my favorite King books, but still, I'm going to miss them nevertheless. SGJ is clearly a life-long Horror lover, a student of the genre, and someone that can tell one hell of a story.I'd love to hang out with him around a campfire...I highly recommend this series to Horror Readers. Particularly to Horror Readers who have been turning to the genre their whole life for comfort and to face fears. Perhaps you'll see a little of yourself in here too.Also, coincidentally, I did happen to rewatch Scream III while reading this and loved coming upon Randy's rules for Slasher Trilogies, which definitely could be applied here. It was great to hear those again from him whilst reading this. So perfect. We love making beautiful Horror connections!!Thank you so much to the publisher, Saga Press, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I already can't wait to read this one again!",5.0
406,Lilith,Thriller,"From the New York Times and internationally bestselling author of I Am Not Who You Think I Am—a New York Times Thriller of the Year—comes Lilith, an incendiary powerhouse of a novel that strikes straight at the wounded heart of America.After her son Lydan suffers traumatic injuries in a school shooting, single mom Elisabeth Ross grows enraged at men in power. If they won’t do anything to help end this epidemic of violence, she will. Believing it’s her destiny, she sets out to awaken the world to the cowards these men are and commits her own shocking act of violence. Going by the name Lilith—the first wife of Adam who fled Eden rather than serve a man—she posts a video of her crime that reverberates throughout society.Praised by some, demonized by others, and sought by the FBI and vigilantes alike, Elisabeth must keep her identity a secret as she tries to care for her son.As events take startling twists, Elisabeth begins to question her act of violence and the very roots and mythology of violence itself. Was her act justified or has she become the monster that the original Lilith was accused of being?When the FBI draws closer, and Lydan starts to display odd, terrifying behavior, Elisabeth plots to avoid capture and keep her son safe, fearing she’ll never escape what she’s done without losing her son forever. Written with Rickstad’s singular command of language, human insight, and unnerving suspense, Lilith is a tale of our times. Tragic and profound, it echoes in the mind and lingers in the blood.","Elizabeth’s son, Lydon, doesn’t want to go to school today. He says he has an ‘icky’ feeling and asks his mum if he can please stay at home? She’s sympathetic and would like nothing more than to stay at home with her beloved boy, but he’s not ill, and as a teacher at his school it’s not a request she can sanction. It proves to be a seminal moment. What transpires that day will change everything - on this day, a man with a gun will enter the school.Elizabeth will survive the events that transpire, but it will change her. Later, she watches the strutting owner of a gun shop announce his intention to run for president, as he also declares that more guns, not less, is the answer to the ongoing succession of mass killings. She knows that someone needs to do something about this idea about this man. Could that somebody be her? Adopting the name Lilith – the moniker attributed to the woman theorised to be the first wife of Adam and supposedly the primordial she-devil – she decides she will concoct and execute a plan of her own.I recently read Bloodbath Nation, Paul Auster’s reflection on America’s relationship with guns. In this memoir/essay, the esteemed writer says that the country has done nothing to address the problems that arise from this irrational love affair, one that is unique to the United States amongst developed nations. It’s a powerful and totally scary piece, as he talks readers through his own experience with guns and lists details of many mass murders across the country. In his conclusion, he concedes that the current impasse between the anti-gun and pro-gun proclaimers will not be resolved any time soon. This novel picks up a different angle to this phenomenon: that just about every mass killing is born from the actions of a man. So perhaps it’s about time women did something about it.This is a thrilling told story. It's short but totally absorbing. I raced through it in a few sessions, never quite knowing how events would play out or what fate awaited our anti-hero. The suspense is maintained throughout, right up to a gripping finish. I liked the way it was set out, too, in an unusual way with sometimes only a few words on a page. It definitely worked for me. I’d enjoyed the author’s previous novel I Am Not Who You Think I Am and this story definitely picks Rickstad out as a writer I’ll be looking out for in the future.My thanks to Blackstone Publishing for providing a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5.0
407,The Best Way to Bury Your Husband,Mystery,"A dark comedy about four women coming together to heal the damage their husbands have done––and hide their bodies once they’ve killed themWhen Sally kills her husband with a cast-iron skillet, she’s more fearful of losing her kids than of disposing of a fresh corpse. That just wouldn’t be fair—not after twenty years of marriage to a truly terrible man. But Sally isn’t the only woman in town reaching the brink. Soon, Sally finds herself leading an extremely unusual self-help group, and among them there are four bodies to hide. Can they all figure out the perfect way to bury their husbands . . . and get away with it?First to join is former nurse, Ruth, who met her husband as a single mom. Now her son is grown and her husband’s violence builds by the day until an attack on the stairs leads to a fatal accident—for him. A few doors down, Samira’s last straw comes when she discovers her husband is planning a campaign of violence against her eldest daughter, who has just come out. Janey, Sally’s best friend, has just had her first child at forty-two. Sleep-deprived Janey needs a hero to slay the monster in the fairy tales she whispers to her daughter each night . . . and as her husband’s violence escalates, it might just be her.Together, fueled by righteous anger but tempered by a moral core, the four women must help each other work out a plan to get rid of their husbands for good. Along the way, Sally, Ruth, Samira and Janey rediscover old joys and embark on new passions in work, education, and life. Friendship and laughter really are the best medicine—and so is getting away with murder.","I think my husband might be a little concerned about how much I loved this book. And, granted, if you ever need to get rid of an inconvenient body, this book has lots of helpful ideas (a desiccation parcel, who knew?!) to assist you in taking care of your problem. Although, really, I exaggerate – my husband is not at all worried about me reading this book because, well, he's not an abusive monster, but also because he already thinks I tried to kill him once and he didn't seem all that bothered. No, really.Let me digress for a moment here. Shortly after we were married, my husband had a dream that I tried to suffocate him while he was sleeping, which he apparently thought really happened. Now, I know what you're thinking the story is here – he immediately woke up, got angry, and I had to convince him that I wasn't actually a murderess. Nope. He didn't say anything about it to me at all, for, like, six months. It only came up one day because he was giving me examples of how I “get grumpy” when I'm tired (apparently I was trying to kill him because he was snoring too loudly – tempting, I'll admit). I assured him that no such thing had occurred. He doubled down. I mean, this is the guy who once, when our son was very little, woke up from a dead sleep, grabbed our very surprised dog off of my lap, plopped her on his chest, and tried to shush her to sleep because he thought it was the baby. This is the level of cognizance he has in the middle of the night. But, sure, I tried to suffocate him. This disturbed me a wee bit, because not only was he (quite nonchalantly) accusing me of attempted murder, but also because what kind of weirdo thinks that their spouse tried to kill them in their sleep and then goes “Oh, well!” and then just goes on about their business without a care in the world? For six months?! These days he claims not to remember his supposed attempted murder or the argument that ensued months later, so apparently he wasn't too traumatized by his imaginary ordeal and has no real fear of me and my murdering ways. I'm pretty sure I could come home tomorrow with a shovel, some lime, and a body bag and he still wouldn't think twice about it, except maybe to bring it up months later in an argument about unnecessary spending. So, yeah.Ahem. Oh, right, the book.This novel is absolutely amazing, although not exactly what I expected. I thought it would be more of a dark humor type of thing, and there definitely is some of that. But, at its heart, it's really a story of friendship, hope, and second chances, and it's both hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time. Of course, there are parts that aren't so fun to read – this is a book about domestic violence, after all. And the women in this book are certainly battered and abused.Is the premise of this book rather absurd? Well, yes. Obviously the chances of four women in the same town murdering their abusive husbands in the same week and then randomly finding each other is very, very low on the probability scale. But I think the author did an excellent job of bringing awareness to the problem of domestic violence, particularly the unique issues that arose during the COVID-19 lockdown, and you kind of just have to suspend your disbelief on some of the rest of it.The characters in this novel are fantastic. Edwina and her snooping was brilliant, and her part in the ending was laugh-out-loud funny. Sally was a likable narrator, and I feel that her backstory did a great job of explaining why abused women don't “just leave him.” I also appreciated the diversity of the characters, which Casale mentions in the afterword was intentional to bring awareness to the fact that domestic abuse occurs across the cultural spectrum. There isn't a mystery in this book per se, other than “will they get away with it?” But there are lots of ridiculous hijinks that occur while the Lockdown Ladies' Burial Club tries to figure out the answer to that question, and it's a delightful ride. Final rating: An enthusiastic 5 stars. This book is one of the highlights of my 2023 reads.Many thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Books for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0
408,Finding Sophie,Thriller,"How far will they go to find the truth?Someone is guilty.For the last seventeen years, Harry and Zara King’s lives have revolved around their only daughter, Sophie. One day, Sophie leaves the house and doesn’t come home. Six weeks later, the police are no closer to finding her than when they started. Harry and Zara have questioned everyone who has ever had any connection to Sophie, to no avail. Except there’s one house on their block—number 210, across the street—whose occupant refuses to break his silence.Someone knows what happened.As the question mark over number 210 devolves into obsession, Harry and Zara are forced to examine their own lives. They realize they have grown apart, suffering in separate spheres of grief. And as they try to find their way back to each other, they must face the truth about their daughter: who she was, how she changed, and why she disappeared.Someone will pay.Told in the alternating perspectives of Harry and Zara, and in a dual timeline between the weeks after Sophie’s disappearance and a year later in the middle of a murder trial, Imran Mahmood’s taut yet profoundly moving novel explores how differently grief can be experienced even when shared by parents—and how hope triumphs when it springs from the kind of love that knows no bounds.","Sophie has disappeared and her parents are worried because they can't find her anywhere.

Sophie was hiding some dark secrets before she disappeared.Her parents are accused of murder I really enjoyed this book. It did have a slow burn to it in the beginning but then the suspense slowly builds and it becomes a thrilling wild ride. This is every parents nightmare. I loved the second half more than the first half. This is a legal thriller then turns into a thriller with lots of action. It had everything that I love in a thriller. This one is very dark and disturbing. I thought all the characters were very well done. The parents went through so much. My heart ached for them. It just broke my heart. OMG! That ending was so good. It went one way, then took a different direction that I wasn't expecting. I want to thank Bantam and Netgalley for the copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",4.0
409,The Housemaid,Thriller,"“Welcome to the family,” Nina Winchester says as I shake her elegant, manicured hand. I smile politely, gazing around the marble hallway.

And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late.But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am.They don’t know what I’m capable of…An unbelievably twisty read that will have you glued to the pages late into the night. Anyone who loves The Woman in the Window, The Wife Between Us and The Girl on the Train won’t be able to put this down!","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖Thank you Bookouture and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2.0
410,The Teacher,Thriller,"Lesson #1: Trust no one.Eve has a good life. She wakes up each day, kisses her husband Nate, and heads off to teach math at the local high school. All is as it should be. Except…Last year, Caseham High was rocked by a scandal involving a student-teacher affair, with one student, Addie, at its center. But Eve knows there is far more to these ugly rumors than meets the eye.Addie can’t be trusted. She lies. She hurts people. She destroys lives. At least, that’s what everyone says.But nobody knows the real Addie. Nobody knows the secrets that could destroy her. And Addie will do anything to keep it quiet…","I've enjoyed previous books by McFadden (Never Lie, The Inmate, The Locked Door) -- so, despite REALLY disliking several of her recent books (The Housemaid's Secret, The Coworker, Ward D) -- I still really wanted to read THE TEACHER. This one felt more like her earlier books in a way I enjoyed -- mainly that it was super fast-paced and full of characters to dislike, so despite some serious misgivings along the way, I still had it clicking along at a pleasantly-surprising two or three stars in my head, but then the epilogue happened. I always expect a McTwist or twelve, and of course won't write a spoiler here (( BUT FEEL FREE TO SCROLL DOWN IF YOU WANT THEM )), but that last ""twist"" was completely fucking unacceptable on many levels.* thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for the NetGalley review copy.

Who is digging? Who is dead? Fun start! Then we flash back to three months earlier where we meet Eve Bennett, who is putting on a pair of black JIMMY CHOO stiletto pumps to go to her job teaching high school math (lol) and thinking about how hot her husband Nate is compared to her... and also how much she hates him because they never fuck anymore. Nate also teaches at the high school - English - and is the hottest hottie hot hot teacher at the school, based on a list made by the senior girls that another faculty member knew about and then shared with Eve? The next chapter is from Addie's perspective. She's a junior, and everyone at school hates her because last year there were rumors she had a relationship with her math teacher, Arthur Tuttle (who is decidedly NOT a hottie hot hot teacher as he evidently resembles Santa?), while he was tutoring her and ""ruined his life"". Eve doesn't like Addie because Arthur is the nicest man ever and could *never* do such a terrible thing. Because that's 100% how the world works. Men who seem nice could never, ever be predators. Duh. Addie gets bullied a bunch by a girl named Kenzie Montgomery - a popular cheerleader who is also (supposedly, but as it turns out way later is NOT) dating Addie's old BFF, Hudson Jankowski. Hudson was Addie's only friend for years - they both had drunk dads and not much money - but then Hudson got swole and started playing football and is now super popular.Anyway, Eve is PISSED because Addie the Santa Destroyer is in her math class and she's going to have to teach her even though she has a ""terrible feeling about this girl."" She drowns her sorrows by going to a shoe store at the mall and thinking about stealing some LOUBOUTINS because it wouldn't be a FMcF book without the word LOUBOUTINS in it at least once, but then she doesn't steal the LOUBOUTINS and goes home and tries to bone Hot Nate, but he's not into it, so they eat some pasta instead. Everyone in this book eats A LOT of pasta.Addie hates math and is not happy to be in mean Eve's class, but she's super jazzed because she's also in Hot Nate's English class and Hot Nate loves poetry and Addie writes poetry and he also writes poetry and he loves Edgar Allan Poe and she also loves Edgar Allan Poe and OMG!!!!!!!!! Addie writes a poem and Hot Nate LOVES it and wants to see her after class because her poem is so amazing and a lyrical masterpiece and should be published. He recruits her for the high school poetry magazine (called REFLECTIONS, dear lord), and he makes a lot of eye contact with his chocolate-bar-brown eyes. Later that day, Eve puts on her MANOLO BLAHNIK boots and ditches Hot Nate to go to a shoe store. It is very important to know that Eve really, REALLY likes shoes. Like so much. She tries on the same LOUBOUTINS she tried on at the mall and then Jay the hot shoe salesman feels her up and they go fuck in the storeroom among the piles of shoes. As it turns out, our girl Eve has been making love (vomit) with the shoe salesman once a week for the past four months and wishes she could run away with him. Oh, Eve. Addie and Hot Nate are at a Reflections meeting and he tells her he's entering her poem in a state competition because she is ""a master of this craft, even at sixteen"" and is so amazing. Addie says she's not amazing at math and Hot Nate asks if his wife is giving Addie a hard time and then says a bunch of shit about how he was dumb at math too and his wife is too logical and not a dreamer like they are... and now Addie is officially being groomed! Then it's Eve's thirtieth birthday and she puts on her LOUIS VUITTON pumps and tries to bone Hot Nate before work, but he's not into it again. Uh oh. Later that night they go out to dinner at a (yep) pasta restaurant and have a terrible time. Nate parks really far away from the entrance to the restaurant which is a dick move because she's still wearing those LOUIS VUITTON pumps with a four-inch heel. Eve thinks she should try to connect more with Hot Nate and let him read his poems to her in a park again like he used to (all I can think about are the Kens playing guitar at the Barbies for four hours on the beach), even though she doesn't even like poetry and would rather do quadratic equations because she likes MATH, goddammit. Hot Nate gets flirted with by the waitress and then spots Addie at the restaurant and talks about Addie's lyrical mind and their mutual love of Edgar Allan Poe a bunch to his wife. Happy B-day, Eve! Addie notices Hot Nate is eating ravioli and ponders his filling selection and wishes she was eating dinner with him so he could share his thoughts about EAP poems with her (again with the Kens on the beach). Addie and Hot Nate run into each other by the pasta restaurant bathroom (sex-ay!) and she worries that someone will see them talking and he'll end up ruined like Santa Tuttle. She tells him about her terrible day being bullied, so he gives her a special homework assignment to write an angry revenge letter to her bully and Addie thinks about what a bitch Eve is for making Hot Nate so unhappy. After the terrible birthday meal, Eve finds a pair of glossy red SAM EDELMAN sling pumps on her porch from Jay. Awww. Sex shoes!Addie's locker gets filled with shaving cream by mean Kenzie, and during the cleanup -- in the first McTwist -- reveals that Hudson helped her kill her father. DUN DUN DUNNNNN! Her dad was a drunk, abusive asshole and they pushed him down the stairs and pretended they were at Hudson's house studying the whole time. After the murder Hudson completely stopped talking to her, but he still helps her clean her locker because he is such a nice guy.Then Hot Nate comes along and helps clean up the last bit of locker shaving cream and offers Addie a ride home from school in his Honda Accord. Addie is digging the ride because the car is cleaner than her mom's and smells like him, and he tells her about the difficulty he experienced being a poetry-writing sixteen-year-old boy and recites the first poem he ever wrote (for his mom, at age six, which Jesus H DOES NOT COUNT AS A POEM), and she wishes they would kiss and thinks ""there's something poetic about the name Nathaniel"" (aaaand I am officially dead because my husband is named Nathaniel and I can't stop laughing even though this entire situation is gross AF). ANYWAY, Eve fucks Jay again. Addie cheats on a math midterm and gets busted. Eve wears her MANOLO BLAHNIKS to school. Hot Nate takes Eve to the bone zone after school so she doesn't rat Addie out to the principal for cheating on the math test. Addie steals Kenzie's keys, lets herself into her house, and breaks a ceramic bird. We are now 47% through this goddamn book.Hot Nate and Addie talk again after a Reflections meeting, and he lets her know that he got her out of trouble with his mean wife. Addie hugs Hot Nate to say thank you, ""But then something firm pokes me in the leg. Like a roll of toilet paper."" Um. I have read more than my fair share of sex business in books and have never in my life heard a boner compared to a roll of toilet paper. I have a lot of questions. Hot Nate apologizes to Addie for the toilet roll in his pants and then immediately launches into complaining about how his wife sucks and how he feels like he's finally connected to someone for the first time in his life. Addie leaves but can't stop thinking about that firm toilet paper pants roll (GIRL, RUN!) and comes back. Hot Nate says he's trying so hard to resist her but he just can't and then they go into the abandoned photography darkroom and make out a bunch. Hot Nate drives Addie home afterwards and tells her she's his soulmate. Then he goes home and tries to bone zone Eve but she turns him down, so now his toilet roll is blue and he is mad.Addie writes a terrible poem about her love for Hot Nate. Then Hot Nate reads her a terrible poem that he wrote. And now I can no longer call him Hot Nate as a joke because he's officially a fucking rapist.Addie and Sexual Predator Nate have a lot of predatory sex in the darkroom. SP Nate continues with the soulmate talk to keep Addie hooked even though ""it doesn't last long, and Nathaniel says that's normal when you like somebody as much as he likes me."" AAAAAAAGH. Addie starts thinking about how much better everything would be if Eve was not around anymore.Then Addie gets her lunch dumped on the ground by Kenzie and Kenzie sees a copy of the poem SP Nate wrote. Eve is mean and won't let Addie eat a sandwich during class, so Addie hates her even more. Eve and SP Nate have a bad dinner party with their friends. Eve spots Addie lurking in the bushes outside of their house and tells SP Nate about it. Eve then tells the principal and Addie gets hauled into the office. SP Nate tells her to ""deny everything"" so she lies and says she wasn't there, but since she also got busted lurking outside of Santa Tuttle's house no one believes her. SP Nate starts ghosting Addie so she goes to see him in his classroom during lunch. They kiss AND EVE SEES THEM and takes a picture. This is the part of the book where Eve talks a bunch about how none of this is Addie's fault and that she is a child and that SP Nate is a fucking creep who took advantage of her vulnerability and that it was his responsibility to keep this from happening because he is an adult. Then goes on to say the age of consent is sixteen, so he's technically NOT a rapist. Keep all of this in mind when we get to the fucking epilogue.Eve then meets up with her fuckboy shoe salesman Jay and tells him everything. They decide she needs to leave Nate and also decide not to tell the principal. Then Eve gets wasted, confronts Nate, and kicks him out. He yells at her a bunch about shoes and leaves. He texts Addie and says he wishes Eve was dead. Addie concurs and eats a bunch of ice cream. Eve also eats a bunch of ice cream and passes out on the couch. She wakes up to a loud crash and worries someone is breaking in to steal her LOUBOUTINS because that is rational and because LOUBOUTINS haven't been mentioned for a few chapters.omfg we're almost at the end. buckle up.The crashing sound was Addie knocking a frying pan off of the stove. Eve and Addie confront each other and Eve says a bunch of reasonable things about SP Nate being a manipulative predator and how his feelings for a teenager are not normal and Addie flips the fuck out and hits Eve in the head with the frying pan. Three times. She calls SP Nate using Eve's phone and SP Nate comes over. Eve wakes up while Addie is getting a sheet to wrap her corpse in and SP Nate strangles her. Addie notices that Eve's body is in a different location and now she has big finger-shaped bruises on her neck, but SP Nate convinces her to help put Eve's body in the trunk and they drive her body to an abandoned pumpkin patch. We learn that SP Nate's biggest fears are death and snakes. They start digging a hole, but then SP Nate lies about getting Eve's purse from the car and abandons Addie and goes home to bed. Addie finishes burying Eve and messages Hudson to come pick her up from the middle of nowhere. Now SP Nate is at home and weird shit keeps happening. He finds shoes in the shower and thinks about The Raven a bunch and eventually calls the police to report Eve missing. He then finds more shoes in strange places - some covered in dirt, some with smashed pumpkin on them, and then there's a bird in his kitchen so he thinks about The Raven some more. FFS. The police visit Addie and question her a little and seem to think she killed Eve because SP Nate shows them her rage letter about Kenzie. Then Kenzie shows up at Addie's house and apologizes for being such a huge bitch and tells Addie SHE was in a relationship with SP Nate when she was FOURTEEN and knows Addie is also being abused because SP Nate gave them both the same shitty poem (which she saw in the lunchroom) and they had to break up when Addie had her Santa Tuttle scandal so that's why she hates Addie so much. The girls then go to the police station and tell them everything - and the police actually believe them, which feels like a fucking miracle.SP Nate is home and finds a pumpkin with a bird inside in his kitchen and freaks out because THE RAVEN. The police are on their way so he goes to the pumpkin patch to check Eve’s grave and make sure she's really dead. Uh-oh... The grave is empty! Eve is alive! Turns out she unburied herself and called Jay to come get her. Jay takes her to the sexy shoe store and gives her some sensible winter non-fuck boots and hides her in his tool shed for a few days. They start pranking SP Nate with the shoes and pumpkins and birds and whatnot and when he goes to the grave they are waiting and hit him with a rock and chuck him in the hole and bury him alive. While digging, Eve remembers the poem SP Nate wrote her when she was fifteen and he was her teacher - and (McTwist!) it’s the same poem he gave Addie and Kenzie so I guess we’re all happy SP Nate is going to be dead in the pumpkin patch because he's a Serial SP with an unstoppable toilet roll. Now we’re (FINALLY) in the epilogue. The police stop investigating because Eve isn’t actually dead and they assume SP Nate just left town without a trace. Eve quits her job and also moves away. Hudson and Addie are friends again and Kenzie has stopped bullying Addie and no one is being sexually abused anymore, so I guess everyone is fine?And now for the final McTwist: IT TURNS OUT HUDSON JANKOWSKI IS THE JAY EVE WAS FUCKING IN THE SHOE STORE so she’s also a sexual predator despite her earlier CORRECT yelling at SP Nate about it being wrong to - you know - have sex with minors. For fuck’s sake. Also - from a strictly logistical standpoint… how did Hudson/Jay manage to drive to the middle of nowhere and back twice in one night to pick up both Addie and Eve? And why is he hanging out with Addie even though she tried to kill Eve? And he already knows she killed her dad? And how did he and Eve catch all of the birds? And get one to stay in a pumpkin? The end.EDITED 2/22/24 TO ADD/CLARIFY : Jay was not married. The baby was his little brother. The ""her""/woman on the phone was Jay/Hudson's mom. And according to FMcF herself... (thanks to a commenter asking FMcF directly) -- EVE KNEW JAY/HUDSON WAS A STUDENT AT HER SCHOOL. Aaaaaaaaaagh barf blech ewwww fuuuuuuck.",1.0
411,Never Lie,Thriller,"Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are searching for the house of their dreams.But when they visit the remote manor that once belonged to Dr. Adrienne Hale, a renowned psychiatrist who vanished without a trace four years earlier, a violent winter storm traps them at the estate… with no chance of escape until the blizzard comes to an end.In search of a book to keep her entertained until the snow abates, Tricia happens upon a secret room. One that contains audio transcripts from every single patient Dr. Hale has ever interviewed. As Tricia listens to the cassette tapes, she learns about the terrifying chain of events leading up to Dr. Hale’s mysterious disappearance.Tricia plays the tapes one by one, late into the night. With each one, another shocking piece of the puzzle falls into place, and Dr. Adrienne Hale’s web of lies slowly unravels.And then Tricia reaches the final cassette.The one that reveals the entire horrifying truth.","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖 I read this as part of a group buddy read on Instagram which is why I didn't yeet it into outer space.  One sentence review:  L M F A O you're joking  SYNOPSIS Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are snowed in during their viewing at the creepy, dusty, secluded mcmansion once owned by Dr. Adrienne Hale, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace four years ago. When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor's disappearance.  MY OPINION BUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE. Where to start, where to start? Ok let's do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here's an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:  But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere. I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere. Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here's a sample: I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him? The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming. Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won't reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:  I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.  Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they're gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.  SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM At first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan's BMW (it's not a car, it's a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she's okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman's RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty. Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she's shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn't one.Tricia's behaviour doesn't even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog's bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would've made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together. Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I'm going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I've read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest. Adding her to my avoid list lol. PROS AND CONS Pros: funny rants with the buddy readers, she did have some good red herrings in there tbh Cons: ... did I stutter? 😂___Check out my YouTube",1.0

But I can't risk losing this job – not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe . . .It's hard to find an employer who doesn't ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It's almost perfect. But I still haven't met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I'm sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I'm doing laundry. And one day I can't help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything...That's when I make a promise. After all, I've done this before. I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

414,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
415,The Inmate,Thriller,"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates. But none of the staff at the prison knows Brooke has already broken the rules. Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary's most notorious and dangerous inmates. And they certainly don't know that Shane was Brooke's high school sweetheart―the star quarterback who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of grisly murders. Or that Brooke's testimony was what put him there. But Shane knows. And he will never forget.","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0

417,The Coworker,Thriller,"Two women. An office filled with secrets. One terrible crime that can't be taken backDawn Schiff is strange. At least, everyone thinks so at Vixed, the nutritional supplement company where Dawn works as an accountant. She never says the right thing. She has no friends. And she is always at her desk at precisely 8:45 a.m.So when Dawn doesn't show up to the office one morning, her coworker Natalie Farrell—beautiful, popular, top sales rep five years running—is surprised. Then she receives an unsettling, anonymous phone call that changes everything…It turns out Dawn wasn't just an awkward outsider—she was being targeted by someone close. And now Natalie is irrevocably tied to Dawn as she finds herself caught in a twisted game of cat and mouse that leaves her wondering: who's the real victim?<But one thing is incredibly clear: somebody hated Dawn Schiff. Enough to kill.","Mcfadden is finally back after some let-downs. This was a fast-paced thriller for sure. I liked the characters, which is great after being so dissatisfied with the characters in never lie and ward d. Even if the main character had her flaws, I felt they were explained better and there was some character development (at least a bit). I must admit I saw the twist coming, but was still curious about how it all would play out, so it was a breeze reading. In the afterword McFadden writes that she’s worked on this book for over 20 (!) years and that shows as I couldn’t find no obvious plot holes, and it was told convincingly. Maybe there was a bit too much spoon-feeding when it came to Dawn who obviously was on the spectrum, but from what I read it wasn’t too stereotypical, and I wasn’t annoyed by the way McFadden described her personality. There was actually a lovely moment in the end and I found myself tearing up. How often does that happen in your standard psychological thriller? Thanks to netgalley and the publisher for the arc",4.0
418,The Locked Door,Thriller,"Some doors are locked for a reason…While eleven-year-old Nora Davis was up in her bedroom doing homework, she had no idea her father was killing women in the basement.Until the day the police arrived at their front door.Decades later, Nora’s father is spending his life behind bars, and Nora is a successful surgeon with a quiet, solitary existence. Nobody knows her father was a notorious serial killer. And she intends to keep it that way.Then Nora discovers one of her young female patients has been murdered. In the same unique and horrific manner that her father used to kill his victims.Somebody knows who Nora is. Somebody wants her to take the fall for this unthinkable crime. But she’s not a killer like her father. The police can’t pin anything on her.As long as they don’t look in her basement.","I’m just not fully understanding the plethora of brilliant ratings for this very mediocre novel. The entire story is reminiscent of In My Father's Basement, but without the intense character development and attention to detail that made Payne’s tale a solid stroke of genius. Instead, the brusque, straightforward style employed by author Freida McFadden is almost too simplistic. The attempt here to portray Nora as a potential heir to her father’s murderous throne comes across as elementary in technique and is never completely convincing, while the final epilogue seals the book’s fate as a valiant effort, minus the “valiant”.",3.0
419,The Perfect Marriage,Thriller,"C. At 33 years old, she is a named partner at her firm and life is going exactly how she planned.The same cannot be said for her husband, Adam. He is a struggling writer who has had little success in his career. He begins to tire of his and Sarah’s relationship as she is constantly working. Out in the secluded woods, at Adam and Sarah’s second home, Adam engages in a passionate affair with Kelly Summers.Then, one morning everything changes. Adam is arrested for Kelly’s murder. She had been found stabbed to death in Adam and Sarah’s second home. Sarah soon finds herself playing the defender for her own husband, a man accused of murdering his mistress. But is Adam guilty or is he innocent?","When I'm feeling a reading slump coming on, I usually pick up a nice fast-paced thriller to get me back into things. According to the reviews, The Perfect Marriage should have been that. All I can say is I guess it's true that it did make me want to read literally anything else.I don't get the hype. The writing isn't great, needs at least another round of editing, and there are plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. Everything is obvious, yet also verging on ridiculous, and people (mostly Adam) act absolutely moronic for no reason whatsoever.Everyone is awful, and not in an interesting way. Adam is the doucheiest misogynistic alpha male douchebag, not to mention a total dumbass, who seemed to do everything within his power to make himself look guilty. Sarah has to whisper ""bitch"" to herself whenever another woman in the room doesn't kiss her arse. The police investigation is laughable, so is the fact that they would charge Adam and send this to trial without accounting for several anomalies that showed up in the ""evidence"" (like someone else's DNA). Sarah, a lawyer, gets more facts on this case than the police have by simply having a conversation with the victim's colleague, which I guess the police neglected to do. And that attempt to explain away the shoddy investigation with the ""oh, it was the sheriff's DNA"" left me far more annoyed than satisfied. Way too convenient and it didn't make any sense.Also, was Kelly in an abusive relationship? Because I'm pretty sure that wasn't cleared up(?) I don't like when a character knows something is or isn't true because they see it in someone's eyes, or some other such nonsense, but then it turned out that maybe he was lying? Who even knows?So many other things I could whine about. The dialogue and the characters' actions all seemed so juvenile; not a single member of law enforcement or attorney behaved with a hint of professionalism-- all of them acted seedy, violent or just plain stupid. I got the sense that the author had no idea about criminal investigations or court proceedings. It is irritating when I put things together way before the characters do and have to watch them scratch their heads and think ""where have I seen this guy before?"" It is also irritating when characters act one way for the entire book then turn to the audience and mwahaha at the end.So much doesn't make sense. The outcome of this book is only reached by having everyone be stupid and do silly things for no reason.",1.0
420,One by One,Thriller,"One by one, they will get what they deserve...A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.Then Claire’s minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren’t as easy to navigate as they thought.Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost. And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear:Only one of them will return home alive.","I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",3.0
421,Listen for the Lie,Mystery,"Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast ""Listen for the Lie,"" and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
422,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him....The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0

The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him. He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his computer shows strange searches. He says they weren't made by him. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone.So what did happen to Nick's beautiful wife?","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0

I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols.

My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0

Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.","2.5 stars?This was straight-up hilarious. The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that people cried while reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑 So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman, this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is. Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don't even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue. She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn't concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in. Oh but she's so evil😢, oh but she's so callous🙄, she's just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time. Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes: 💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean like literally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I'd be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me. 

I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.

How I imagined Verity every time she'd unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.

my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast. My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy. Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.

Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I was half fully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav. I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn't creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie. 

He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.

And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I've ever read. EVER. In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you'd expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We're not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn't care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power. EDIT 08.2022: 8 months later and I've decided we're gonna talk about the ending. Here's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I'm gonna choose the letter. As we've already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn't any better. Personally being impressed with the author's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist... WOULD BE if this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn't, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one. all in all: I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that's about it.EDIT 10.2022: I've read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍",2.0
429,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Fiction,"Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden’s wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.An international publishing sensation, Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into one satisfyingly complex and entertainingly atmospheric novel.","I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0

There is something deeply unhealthy about this book. It's in the characters, in the story, in the relationships, in the sex, and just in the general mood of the novel. Reading this made me feel a little unwell, both physically and mentally, but I am glad I did. If you know me, you'll know I love complex characters with issues that feel raw and real, rather than melodramatic. The people in this novel are majorly fucked up, no one is without a dark past and everyone, it seems, has a horror story.The protagonist - Camille Preaker - was just thirteen when her sister died and fuelled by grief (amongst other things) Camille spent her teen years carving words into her flesh, covering almost every inch of her body with the marks of her pain. Ten years later, Camille Preaker is now a journalist who returns to the small town of her youth to report on the murders of two young girls - girls who had had all of their teeth removed.Camille is soon caught up in the town once again, she tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the troublesome half sister she hardly knows. It seems that once again small towns hold the biggest secrets and Camille finds herself getting dragged deeper and deeper into the investigation, her fragile state of mind constantly threatening to tip her over the edge.This is one mean and nasty book. I knew I was getting a dark, psychological thriller, but I expected something on par with In The Woods by Tana French. Um, not exactly. Flynn never shies away from the horrific details. You're not going to find anything pleasant in this story; sex, for example, is always something complex - it's an escape or a bargain or a catharsis. Everything else is similar.Flynn does a fantastic job of challenging the notion that women are weak, innocent, damsels in distress. In a world where women are victims - both in their media representation and in statistics - this is a very interesting look at other kinds of women. It's programmed into us to believe that women are safer, kinder, built with an instinct that makes it difficult for them to be cruel and cause pain without reason. Maybe we were always wrong.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",4.0
432,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

433,The Woman in the Window,Thriller,"Anna Fox lives alone, a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother and their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble and its shocking secrets are laid bare.What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.","Who knows what goes on in a family?
Okay, I really don't want to misrepresent this book: The Woman in the Window is a pulpy, fast-paced popcorn thriller. It's not mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it is pageturning goodness. And it was exactly what I needed to get lost in right now.The premise is a little bit of The Girl on the Train and a little bit of The Woman in Cabin 10 (what is it with these girl/woman/wife titles?!), with an unreliable narrator, faulty memories, alcoholism, and the author playing around with our perception of what is true and what is imagined. My need to know what would happen kept me turning pages late into the night until I was physically incapable of keeping my eyes open a moment longer.The Woman in the Window treats a rather obvious plot element as a spoiler for most of the book, so I'll play coy too. It's about a woman called Anna who lives alone ever since separating from her husband and daughter. We're not told the circumstances of the separation, but we do know that Anna has a drinking problem and severe agoraphobia that prevents her from leaving the house.Housebound and drunk, Anna spends her days spying on her neighbours, until one day she witnesses something shocking in the window of the Russell's home. Everything begins to unravel when Anna attempts to report what she saw, and soon everything is being questioned: Did Anna hallucinate? Is it a combination of alcohol and pills? Can she even trust herself?The chapters are short and hard-hitting, making the fast-moving plot zip by even faster (""This is the LAST chapter. Oh wait, the next is only two pages? Okay, this is the last chapter""). I think the author does a great job of capturing both the fuzzy-headed confusion brought on by Anna's alcoholism and the suffocating claustrophobia of staying inside for almost a year. She makes for a pretty great unreliable narrator, and it is easy to feel her frustration when she can't even be sure herself if what she says is completely true.I also really liked how the author included Anna's passion for classic thriller movies. These offer interesting parallels with her reality and make you question whether something really did happen, or if Anna just saw it in a movie. Plus there's something a bit creepy about all these black and white flicks playing out in the background.The Woman in the Window is the kind of cozy psychological thriller that is easy to gobble up in a sitting or two. I didn't even mind that some things were obvious because the getting there was so damn fun and suspenseful. I'll be on the lookout for more from Finn.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0

IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2.0
436,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,Mystery,"Everyone in Fairview knows the story.Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
437,Dark Places,Mystery,"Libby Day was just seven years old when her evidence put her fifteen-year-old brother behind bars.Since then, she has been drifting. But when she is contacted by a group who are convinced of Ben's innocence, Libby starts to ask questions she never dared to before. Was the voice she heard her brother's? Ben was a misfit in their small town, but was he capable of murder? Are there secrets to uncover at the family farm or is Libby deluding herself because she wants her brother back?She begins to realise that everyone in her family had something to hide that day... especially Ben. Now, twenty-four years later, the truth is going to be even harder to find.Who did massacre the Day family?","“I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.”
I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity. Okay, sorry, I make it sound so negative when actually this book is pretty fantastic if you can stomach the horrors within. I ate this up in a couple of days, finding every opportunity to read that I could... Flynn certainly has a talent for dragging you into her stories and having them take you over until you find out just what the hell is going on.As much as I enjoyed its dark predecessor - Sharp Objects - I think Dark Places was, for me, a more complex and well-developed mystery. I had many theories as to what was going on and all of them were wrong. You know, I honestly think that writing a mystery story must be the most difficult of all, because the reader is your enemy. Most readers of mystery stories will analyse the information they're given, pull it apart, and try desperately to solve the mystery before the characters do - and yet, if they are successful, they feel disappointed. For an author to manage to pull out something both surprising and convincingly real at the end of all this, they have to have a talent for it.Dark Places alternates between the present day and 1985 when Ben Day allegedly massacred three members of his family, his sister - Libby - being the only one to escape and testify as a witness, sending Ben to a life in prison. Now, after years of living on the donations made by concerned members of the public, Libby Day has finally run out of money and is forced to earn some cash by making an appearance at a group meeting where the members believe Ben is innocent. At first, Libby is willing to write them off as crazy fanatics with a grisly obsession... but as more information is presented to her, she starts to question what really happened all those years ago.The story is told from three main points of view and, to say I'm not a fan of multiple perspectives, I thought it was done excellently. Patty Day is an exhausted mother-of-four who starts to fear her son is becoming involved in satanic rituals; torn between wanting to protect him and being a little afraid of what his behaviour means, we begin to question through her eyes whether the heavy metal-loving loner could really have it in him to become a murderer. Then we have Ben Day's point of view. Being inside his mind is a little frightening - we see how his thoughts become increasingly dark, how just wanting to have something normal can lead to the most abnormal behaviour... but does that mean he would really murder his family?And, of course, there is Libby Day. Libby Day is the reason I think I enjoy Flynn's novels so much. She is so imperfect, complex, selfish, violent... but somehow you manage to stay on her side. I have no idea how the author manages this, but I've always loved a protagonist with issues, the kind of issues that make them lash out in ways that would make you hate them if you weren't inside their head, understanding them. She does some horrible things and, though you don't necessarily forgive her for them, you are able to see why.If you're okay reading about filth, gore, and underage sex, then you should dive into this mystery straight away and immerse yourself in the disturbing but awesome mental workings of Gillian Flynn.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",5.0
438,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest,Fiction,"The stunning third and final novel in Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling trilogy.Lisbeth Salander - the heart of Larsson's two previous novels - lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She's fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she'll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revenge - against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back.~from the jacket","These books really shouldn't work. Stieg Larsson is a very weird writer. He likes to tell us absolutely everything someone is doing. If Stieg wrote the story of my morning, it would go like this:""Joel woke up around 7:45 a.m. and looked at the clock. He decided he didn't need to get up yet and hit the snooze button. When the alarm sounded again, he dragged himself out of bed and used the toilet. He brushed his teeth and then dressed in a blue striped shirt, black tie and flat front dress slacks he'd purchased on sale at Kohl's. He made himself a cup of coffee, fired up his 13-inch Macbook laptop and checked his email. He had 14 messages. 11 of them were advertisements from various mailing lists or spam emails encouraging him to enlarge his penis. One message was from his mother and two more were shipping notices for books he'd purchased from Amazon.com. He read the note from his mother but decided to reply later. He then deleted all the messages but the two from Amazon and closed his laptop. He sat on the couch and stared into space, drinking his coffee and thinking.""Most writers would probably start the scene several paragraphs later, when I finally get to work (that's where the real excitement happens! I check even MORE email!). (Plus it turns out I'm not even a main character.) But for some reason, this style is, I don't know, endearing instead of annoying. I love the way he tells us every time Mikael has a cigarette or what he likes on his sandwiches. And hey, at least I know what brand of cell phone everyone is using.It's kind of weird how the series wound up being not at all what I was expecting. Book one was closest, a serial killer story that was nevertheless a weird mash-up of political potboiler and are-the-lambs-screaming-Clarice murder fun. But then book two was mostly about the internal politics of the Swedish police and media industries. And the big climax of the trilogy comes down to an incredibly extended legal thriller, Grisham-style. I assume. I've never read a John Grisham book.But really, everyone knows why the books work, and it's because of the characters. Stieg approached the whole trilogy as a sort of manifesto about the injustices heaped upon women in Swedish society, and illustrates them via a host of compelling, level-headed, fairly well-rounded women who are fun to read about even when they spend every other page having sex with the Stieg stand-in. Everyone loves Lisbeth, of course, and this installment does a good job of fleshing out her back story and explaining how exactly one winds up a tattooed, antisocial computer-hacking genius with an insatiable hunger for revenge and Billy's pan pizza.This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. I don't read legal thrillers but I love courtroom scenes in movies, especially when judges say stuff like ""I'm going to allow it, but you'd better be going somewhere with this."" No one says that here, but only because apparently you can do whatever the fuck you want in a Swedish courtroom without bothering to talk to the judge at all. On the bright side, a flustered prosecutor does break out another old chestnut --""This is highly irregular!"" -- that almost makes up for it.So, yeah, I'm a little sad that Lisbeth has stalked off to that big Ikea-furnished apartment in the sky to join her creator. And I wish Stieg didn't eat quite so many of the fatty sandwiches and Billy's pan pizzas he loved detailing so much (hey, write what you know). If book 4 never emerges from that mythical laptop, though, this is a pretty good place to end things.",4.0

3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
442,The Day Tripper,Time Travel,"It’s 1995, and Alex Dean has it all: a spot at Cambridge University next year, the love of an amazing woman named Holly and all the time in the world ahead of him. That is until a brutal encounter with a ghost from his past sees him beaten, battered and almost drowning in the Thames.He wakes the next day to find he’s in a messy, derelict room he’s never seen before, in grimy clothes he doesn’t recognize, with no idea of how he got there. A glimpse in the mirror tells him he’s older—much older—and has been living a hard life, his features ravaged by time and poor decisions. He snatches a newspaper and finds it’s 2010—fifteen years since the fight.After finally drifting off to sleep, Alex wakes the following morning to find it’s now 2019, another nine years later. But the next day, it’s 1999. Never knowing which day is coming, he begins to piece together what happens in his life after that fateful night by the river.But what exactly is going on? Why does his life look nothing like he thought it would? What about Cambridge, and Holly? In this thrilling adventure, Alex must navigate his way through the years to learn that small actions have untold impact. And that might be all he needs to save the people he loves and, equally importantly, himself.","The story in this book starts in 1995 when Alex Dean is a young man who met the love of his life and has a bright future ahead of him. Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion. It leaves us to wonder and analyze our own lives to decide that we made the best decisions in the course of it.",4.0
443,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

445,Cascade Failure,Science Fiction,"L. M. Sagas' debut, Cascade Failure, is a highly commercial, sci-fi adventure blending J. S. Dewes' Divide series with the broad fan appeal of The Expanse and the cozy sf of Becky Chambers. It features a fierce, messy, chaotic space fam, vibrant worlds, and an exploration of the many ways to be―and not to be―human.There are only three real powers in the universe: the corporate power of the Trust versus the Union's labor's leverage. And between them, the Guild tries to keep everyone's hands above the table. It ain't easy.Branded a Guild deserter, Jal ""accidentally"" lands a ride on a Guild ship. Helmed by an AI, with a ship's engineer/medic who doesn't see much of a difference between the two jobs, and a ""don't make me shoot you"" XO, the Guild crew of the Ambit is a little . . . different.They're also in over their heads. Responding to a distress call from an abandoned planet, they find a mass grave, and a live programmer who knows how it happened. The Trust has plans. This isn't the first dead planet, and it's not going to be the last.Unless the crew of the Ambit can stop it.Ambit's Run seriesCascade Failure","I would like to thank Edelweiss and Tor Books for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.This was a super simple galaxy romp, with an interesting crew and a full of ""feelings"" AI captain. There was a touch of tension, some running-through-the-marketplace action and some performative melodrama that was about as believable as Saint and Jal's ""die for each other"" vibe being a ""nothin' but bros"" flex. Regardless, this had potential but it read a bit flat to me. I honestly don't think I'm the ""goofy"" SciFi type. I thought Anke was weird... and not in the good way. And her dialogue was exceptionally cringe. Nash's too. I was NOT a fan of either of these two, and I think there's a definite line between quirky and immature, and I would have enjoyed this book so much more had these two characters read less puerile. I'm probably not the intended reader for this, so I won't belabour the point, because I'd like to forget how awkward I felt reading their POVS. Other than that, Cascade Failure isn't doing anything new, but there were still some fun moments scattered throughout. I enjoyed the first part much more than the second, and somehow I'd found a deep well of patience for whatever the fk was going on between Saint and Jal that kept me intrigued enough to stick it out. But like most of this book, there just wasn't enough depth in the characterizations, or the plot for that matter, for me to feel invested in the outcome.I do like Saint and Jal and Eoan a lot though, even if they are just the prototypical soldier-cyborg-AI triad that's pretty much a genre staple, so there's that. Cascade failure isn't reinventing the wheel, and will appeal more to those new/unfamiliar with the genre. But there's a bit of potential here and I'm curious enough to see where the Ambit is headed to next, so I'll probably continue this series a bit later on...once enough time has passed and I've significantly forgotten how cringey I found both Anke and Nash to be.",3.0
446,The Mars House,Science Fiction,"In the wake of environmental catastrophe, January, once a principal in London’s Royal Ballet, has become a refugee on Tharsis, the terraformed colony on Mars. In Tharsis, January’s life is dictated by his status as an Earthstronger—a person whose body is not adjusted to Mars’s lower gravity and so poses a danger to those born on, or naturalized to, Mars. January’s job choices, housing, and even transportation options are dictated by this second-class status, and now a xenophobic politician named Aubrey Gale is running on a platform that would make it all worse: Gale wants all Earthstrongers to be surgically naturalized, a process that can be anything from disabling to deadly.When Gale chooses January for an on-the-spot press junket interview that goes horribly awry, January’s life is thrown into chaos, but Gale’s political fortunes are damaged, too. Gale proposes a solution to both their problems: a five-year made-for-the-press marriage that would secure January’s financial future without naturalization and ensure Gale’s political future. But when January accepts the offer, he discovers that Gale is not at all like they appear in the press. And worse, soon, January finds himself entangled in political and personal events well beyond his imagining. Gale has an enemy, someone willing to destroy all of Tharsis to make them pay—and January may be the only person standing in the way.","On my blog.
Rep: achillean mc, agender li, agender societyGalley provided by publisherIn the months between reading The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House, I made a promise with myself: if Natasha Pulley’s next book didn’t do away with the misogyny that has characterised her previous five books to varying degrees (as I mentioned in my 
Valery K
 review), then I would give up on her future books. Well, I have good news on that front, because there was no misogyny in this one!If only because there were no women* whatsoever.Now, this really isn’t my primary issue with the book, except that I think it ties in with a general misunderstanding of gender which undercuts anything this book might be trying to say about the topic (this is, to be perfectly honest, my most generous take on it. That it’s trying to say anything at all, notwithstanding the question of whether it’s capable of doing so). No, this is merely a single issue within a sea of them, which, lucky you!, I will be enumerating in this review. Stop reading now if you want to a. avoid spoilers, or b. simply desire the feeling of wanting to read this book. For those of you who read further, well. Godspeed.There are very few reviews which I can’t just write from my notes, but my notes are so long and cumbersome for this one that I have actually needed to sit down and get them in order before even attempting a review. In trying to group together all of my problems here, I think most of it comes down to failures in worldbuilding. A second, smaller but not more minor, set of issues relates to the characters. A final set — and this one I can call more minor — regards Pulley’s writing itself, which I never thought I’d say, having loved it in at least four of her previous five. Oh and then, one big glaring, what the fuck bit.So, let’s take them one by one.— The worldbuilding.1. Gender.We’re starting with one of the two big issues straight up and that’s Pulley’s treatment of gender. Or, to be more exact, the way she has created a society without gender. Firstly, I have to say, reading this at the same time as Ann Leckie’s Imperial Radch, a sci-fi series that thinks about gender in an interesting way, was a mistake. All it did was show up how badly it was done here.Pulley’s concept of gender is solely based on pronoun use. It took me a little while to figure it out (mostly because I couldn’t believe the justification would be this inane), but the reason everyone on Mars uses they pronouns is twofold: one, they all speak Mandarin and, because in spoken Mandarin ‘he’ and ‘she’ sound the same, they decided instead to just make it a ‘they’ pronoun and apply it to everyone. Thus, we have a distinction between the “civilised” Martians (who are a few generations removed from having travelled from Earth to Mars) who only use ‘they’, and the “uncivilised” refugees who still insist on using ‘he’ and ‘she’. And secondly, while choosing to use ‘they’ — which I also want to note was, it sounds, just an arbitrary decision — they also eliminated “extreme gender traits” in DNA. Whatever that means!All of this, I think, just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of our own concept of gender in the 21st century, let alone what a concept of gender a few decades down the line might look like. But what we can safely say is that, if it’s not based on pronouns now, it’s hardly going to suddenly convert to being based on pronouns in the future, is it? Not to mention the whole pronouns thing is actually being translated from Mandarin to make this happen. The characters are speaking Mandarin as the book happens, albeit a Mandarin which has had a few generations to develop from Mandarin as we know it now (enough, it seems, for Mars to exact genetic alterations on humans too, while not being that far removed into the future. And here I was thinking these things moved slowly…). I could buy that there’s a ‘they’ pronoun developed in this futuristic Mandarin. I cannot buy that they basically said “well, these two words sound the same so let’s merge them together”. That is. Not how language works! Not to mention that these words in written Mandarin are still different. You can’t just smush them together and translate them as ‘they’ because they sound the same. Are you going to do that in English for ‘sun’ and ‘son’? No! And, even in spoken Mandarin, there’ll often be context to tell you which pronoun the speaker means, so I would imagine it’s rarely hugely ambiguous. Mandarin speakers are not considering themselves to be going around calling everyone ‘they’ because the words sound the same. (Plus, I feel it’s somewhat disrespectful to nonbinary Mandarin speakers who, you know, might want their own pronouns?) (P.S. for a more accurate take from a Mandarin speaker, see the first point of this review. My analysis was primarily based on Pulley's claims within the book.)Moving on from the pronouns, let’s come to this whole thing of eliminating extreme gender traits from DNA, thus effectively making everyone agender. It’s hard to put into words just how much this whole idea wants to poke my eyes out. It plays exactly into TERF rhetoric that gender equals biology. By removing the “biology” (questionable to say the least?), you remove the “gender”. So our agender society has TERF-y logic underpinning it. Combine this with the part I mentioned at the start where using ‘they’ makes you “civilised” and ‘he’ or ‘she’ “uncivilised” and you get some really weird shit. There are “pro-gender” terrorists in this and I cannot for the life of me tell if it’s some TERF allegory, or in which direction it’s meant to be. Are the Martians TERFs because of their biological understanding of gender? Are the Earth diaspora TERFs because of their insistence on clinging to Earth ideas of gender (which, by the way, does not appear to include nonbinary or trans people in itself)? Is everyone a TERF???One piece more of information can inform us here: in creating an agender society, Natasha Pulley has, barring the minorest of minor characters, entirely eradicated women from her novel. Maybe no one’s a TERF then. Don’t need feminism if you don’t have women!(That’s sarcastic, btw.)2. In-world racism.Second of the major issues with worldbuilding regards the in-world concepts of racism, and how exactly characters are racist. This is a book about anti-immigrant politics, about a politician whose entire platform rests on xenophobic and racist rhetoric. Basically, what we have here is a book that essentially translates as “far right politician forced to fake-date political opposite and they fall in love”. And yes, I should absolutely have read that blurb and stayed the fuck away. Alas, I do not appear to possess basic survival instincts, but, since I did read this, I can detail exactly what’s awful about it!Let me just say, overall this felt like a very strange take from a British author in the midst of such an anti-immigration Tory government. I don’t want to make any assumptions about Pulley’s personal politics, but uh. Yeah. You’ll see why.Once again, Pulley demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge about how racism works, and falls straight into that SFF trap that has authors try to justify racism (see this article for explanation if you don’t already know this part). It turns out that humans coming to Mars from Earth are, due to the differences in gravity, automatically bigger and stronger than Martians who’ve spent years there and who are frail and fragile in comparison. So much that an Earther might easily kill a Martian with just a tap and are thus forced to remain in literal cages as they go about their day. The reason our love interest in particular is xenophobic is because they were attacked by an Earther and injured a little while before the events of the book take place. Thus, they choose to call for all Earthers to be surgically altered so they’re less strong and pose no threat to Martians (a surgery which drastically ruins Earther quality of life, by the by).Now, January — January is the most frustrating protagonist in this respect. Instead of challenging Gale on their bigotry, he tries to accommodate them. He’s repeatedly saying he disagrees with the idea that Earthers are dangerous, only to turn around and say “well, we are dangerous, we might accidentally kill a Martian”, like he’s justifying it. He wears his cage almost permanently around Gale, and even hands them the key to it, so he can’t take it off until Gale decides they’re not scared of him any longer (a decision which has a negative impact on his own health). He spends a lot of the time advocating for his own oppression. A common conversation between January and Gale will go like so:GALE, A BIGOT: Earthstrongers must be all surgically altered so they’re not dangerous to native Martians.JANUARY, A WET DRIP: You’re a bigot! But actually, you’re right because we are soooo much stronger and sooooo dangerous to you guys :( Yes, we should all be kept in cages :(I don’t even think you can make the effective argument that January’s been indoctrinated by Martian bigotry because he’s not even been there a year! He fails to conform to the pronouns thing, but he’s perfectly happy considering himself dangerous and a potential killer all the time? Uh, okay. It takes a good half of the book for January to stand up to Gale’s xenophobia in any way, at which point it suddenly becomes justified for another reason. Great!There are another couple of questionable aspects to mention before we move on (okay, questionable might be too weak a word). Firstly, there’s an undercurrent of suspicion that the immigrants are coming over to subsume the Martian colony back into Earth China, which isn’t that challenged. I mean, it’s revealed that the end that the non-fascist politician is actually working to do this, so it’s almost like… fascist good??? Secondly, the plot ends with the building of an immigration detention centre. I kid you not, that’s how they resolve the arrival of these refugees. By building a detention centre.But don’t worry, it’s a nice detention centre! It has toilets and everything!3. Other wishy-washy worldbuilding aspects.In general, I think Natasha Pulley’s writing lends itself better to real world fiction, or rather, fiction based in a setting she doesn’t have to make up so much. Where there’s some grounding in what we (and she) already know(s). A lot of the worldbuilding in this one felt somewhat flimsy, included because why not!, rather than because it made sense or added to the narrative.Case in point: the talking mammoths. For some apparent reason, there are both polar bears and mammoths on Mars. And the mammoths have language! They can talk! They can offer Gale political advice! And, I KID YOU NOT, it is from these mammoths, in a single conversation, that Gale learns tolerance and acceptance (and thus uncages January).It was at this point that I’m pretty sure I burst into hysterics and checked out of the book. The talking mammoths felt so entirely out of step with the whole rest of the story, and that they were what prompted Gale’s change of heart (not, you might think, January proving himself trustworthy (as if he should have had to, etc etc))? I give up trying to make sense of anything about this, there’s no point! The only function they appeared to serve (besides the whole teaching tolerance nonsense) was that you can point to the book and say look! It’s got talking mammoths!“Was I just schooled about the nature of good government by a mammoth?” Gale asks. Boy, I really fucking hope not.(It also felt like Pulley wrote the mechanical octopus into The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and has been trying to recapture that kind of effortless whimsy in her books ever since. Alas, talking mammoths are anything but effortless.)— The characters.Everything I have to say from here will get progressively shorter, I’m sure you’re glad to know. In fact, my comments on the characters will probably be the shortest of all. Really, what I want to say here is solely that Pulley’s characters are starting to feel incredibly samey, in particular the last three protagonists she’s written. Thaniel and Merrick are probably her most distinct of characters, followed by Joe (simply because he’s the first of the next three). Yes, they all share similarities (perhaps more than you might want for an author), but not so much as Joe, Valery and January do.This is, likely, a disservice to Joe and The Kingdoms (which is my favourite of Pulley’s books, although I fear testing it by rereading it after this!). He is, after all, the prototype. And maybe my view of Valery and January as very similar to him is borne of the fact that The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House are easily my least favourite Pulley books. But the fact remains that I don’t think any of the three are meaningfully distinct. Their POVs sound exactly the same — a fact which could be put down to writing style, yes — but they also feel like the same character cast in three different plots.There’s also a pattern appearing where Pulley’s couples are made up of a big, brutish-seeming-but-actually-a-gentle-giant character, along with a smaller, frailer character (often also more womanish?? But that could be retrospective analysis from me), and a fair amount is made of their difference in size and power. Admittedly, that last part is greater here simply because the whole thing about physical power is plot-relevant (or rather, bigotry-relevant). Your mileage may vary on how much you can stand the whole size difference schtick, but with six books of couples forming this pattern, I at least am starting to feel a bit like. Ooooh-kaaaay.— The writing.Pulley’s writing is, as ever, lovely, and probably one of the only positive things I have to mention about this book, but even that comes with a caveat. All of Pulley’s books have this quiet kind of gentleness to them, which worked for the first four books and even with the brutality of The Kingdoms, where it felt like the contrast between that gentleness and the non-gentleness of events highlighted the latter. It has not worked well here, much like it didn’t in The Half Life of Valery K. In the latter case, it served more to feel like it was downplaying the horrors of the gulag. This was probably because Pulley was more inclined to fully describe the brutality of The Kingdoms and more likely to brush over it in The Half Life of Valery K (possibly because the romance was between a prisoner and a guard?). In The Mars House, that gentleness becomes tonally quite odd. There’s all this anti-immigrant rhetoric and discussion of disabling surgery and eugenics, and it’s all packaged up in this writing that feels like it obscures those horrors. Like I said, odd.Of course, though, if you had full access to those horrors, if it didn’t feel like there was a blanket being placed over it all to muffle the noise, there would be no way in hell that you could root for Gale as January’s love interest.— The what the fuck bit.Last but not least, and really quite pertinent given that, as I’m writing this, Israeli occupation forces are in the midst of committing genocide in Gaza and every day brings with it more and more horrific war crimes by their soldiers, this book, set in the future, is doing its bit to bring that reality nearer. There are two mentions of Israel in this and, firstly, that’s two too many. One is the mention of an AI having a “wonderful, homely Israeli accent”. Which, yuck, and also you could have chosen any country in the world to make this comment, so why an illegal apartheid state, huh? (Also January is from Britain: why would he consider Israel to be “homely”??) But to make it even more egregious, with the next mention, Pulley erases Palestine in its entirety.I stress that this book is set in the future for this very reason. In Pulley’s future, it seems that Israel has succeeded in its aim of murdering every Palestinian and wiping out their state, culture, and entire existence. There is, in here, a scene set during Christmas, in which a young Martian child reading an Earther book, asks what Bethlehem is. January has no response, so Gale cuts in to say that it’s a town in Israel.A quick google search would tell you that Bethlehem is a town in the West Bank, a.k.a. in Occupied Palestine. Not Israel! In fact, being in the West Bank, in an area where (technically) Israelis are not permitted. So not only has Pulley chosen to normalise the existence of an illegal settler-colonial state in her future-set book, she has also chosen to entirely wipe out the land’s indigenous population. Just giving the IOF a helping hand!So, with this comes to a close possibly the longest review I have ever written, and definitely the longest essay-type thing I have since finishing my dissertation a few years ago. If you’ve stuck with me this far, congrats! I hope I’ve not killed your enthusiasm over this one too much. If you’re skipping to the end, I offer you this TL;DR: in conclusion, fascism solved because the fascist marries someone oppressed 🫶🏻.*This is not quite true because, reading through my notes, I found the following: chapter 20: OH MY GOD IT’S A WOMAN. She lasted for one single chapter though, so I think it barely counts.",1.0
447,Those Beyond the Wall,Science Fiction,"Faced with a coming apocalypse, a woman must reckon with her past to solve a series of sudden and inexplicable deaths in a searing sci-fi thriller from the Compton Crook Award–winning author of The Space Between Worlds.Scales is the best at what she does. She is an enforcer who keeps the peace in Ashtown; a rough, climate-ravaged desert town. But that fragile peace is fractured when a woman is mangled and killed within Ash's borders, right in front of Scales's eyes. Even more incomprehensible is that there was seemingly no murderer.When more mutilated bodies start to turn up, both in Ashtown and in the wealthier, walled-off Wiley City, Scales is tasked with finding the cause—and putting an end to it. She teams up with a frustratingly by-the-books partner and a brusque-but-brilliant scientist in order to uncover the truth, delving into both worlds to track down the invisible killer. But what they find points to something bigger and more corrupt than they could've ever foreseen—and it could spell doom for the entire world.","I blurbed this book, and this is what I said:""A bold, beautiful, gut punch of a story, at turns ferocious and poetic—and sometimes both at once.""AND I MEANT IT.I do want to additionally note that the great strength of this book is its characters, who are pretty much universally complicated people in the sense that their ""complications"" or flaws actually cost them things. Often we see characters who are technically flawed, but their flaws don't actually enter the narrative in a significant way, and I find it far more satisfying when they do. This book succeeds on that level and I was impressed with it.I also stopped to screenshot a few lines because I found them to be really lovely, and here's my favorite one:""Once he's gone, I slide backward through the hologram of what looks like finished steel and slip into the dark the city doesn't know is under its skin."" Anyway, if you haven't read the first in this series, now's the time. I really enjoyed it, but I have to say, I liked this one even more.edit: I forgot to say that the thread of romance in this book made me feel absolutely unhinged (in a positive way)-- it's not a big focus but HI I LOVED IT",5.0

(Think John Marrs)BUT, unfortunately, despite the use of this device to achieve the “desired outcome” this was really just ANOTHER story about a buried SECRET, BETRAYAL, and REVENGE, and not one that I enjoyed.

450,Greatest Hits,Short Stories,"How to summarize the psychedelic, witty, helter-skelter mind of Harlan Ellison?A mind that refused to be contained by something as rudimentary as genre, form, or even a particular label. A mind that created some of the most outrageous short stories and novellas of the science fiction, fantasy, and speculative genres – including “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream,” with its unhinged artificial intelligence bent on torturing what is left of humanity, and “Jeffty Is Five,” featuring a young boy’s mysterious, time-bending powers. A mind that passionately identified with the underdog, sometimes with disastrous results. A mind incandescent with fury, that saw storytelling as “a holy chore.”Assembled by the Harlan and Susan Ellison Foundation, Greatest Hits is an overview of Ellison’s award-winning and highly acclaimed short stories – as well as the stories that Ellison himself most treasured. Featuring a preface by Ellison’s executor and friend J. Michael Straczynski, a foreword by award-winning and bestselling author Neil Gaiman, and an introduction by bestselling author Cassandra Khaw, this collection of short stories and novellas serves as a guide to a writer who left his mark on the twentieth century – and whose legacy is in your hands.","GREATEST HITS by Harlan EllisonPublished: March 26,2024 by Union Square & CoPage Count: 496  The title says it all. Collected into one volume are hand-picked short story gems over the course of Harlan Ellison’s prolific career. If not Award Winners ( like Hugo, Nebula, Bram Stoker) they have been nominated for these awards. Presented by an insightful foreword by Neil Gaiman, these hand picked stories are culled from his prestigious output by his friend and executor of his estate, the wonderful writer, J Michael Straczynski. Horror writer, Casandra Khaw provides a wonderful introduction. This collection is an excellent starting point for new readers, as well as old fans, who want to revel once again in his amazing oeuvre. There are no stinkers here … all are great to amazing.  The following few are some of my personal favorites:“I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream” (1966) …. An amazing prediction and discussion of current thoughts and disputes regarding artificial intelligence“Mefisto In Onyx” (1993) … a mind reader applies his skill to a mass murderer”“Jeffty Is Five” (1977) …. He never grows old and has the ability to access on his radio current episodes of programs cancelled a long time ago“Paladin of the Last Hour” (19896) …. the story source of a great episode of The Twilight Zone“Repent Harlequin, Said TheTicktockman” (1966) …. In a dystopian world “wasting time” is a capital offense Ellison was a prolific writer of speculative fiction, who carefully chose his words … often to express his opinions regarding both social and political issues. He frequently veered into many controversial and current issues; censorship, misogyny, racism, corporate greed, exploitation of artists, and even political corruption. His words were sometimes whimsical, but always vibrant and thought provoking. This is an excellent primer to explore his genius.

452,Alien Clay,Science Fiction,"They travelled into the unknown and left themselves behind . . .On the distant world of Kiln lie the ruins of an alien civilization. It’s the greatest discovery in humanity’s spacefaring history – yet who were its builders and where did they go?Professor Arton Daghdev had always wanted to study alien life up close. Then his wishes become a reality in the worst way. His political activism sees him exiled from Earth to Kiln’s extrasolar labour camp. There, he’s condemned to work under an alien sky until he dies.Kiln boasts a ravenous, chaotic ecosystem like nothing seen on Earth. The monstrous alien life interacts in surprising, sometimes shocking ways with the human body, so Arton will risk death on a daily basis. However, the camp’s oppressive regime might just kill him first. If Arton can somehow escape both fates, the world of Kiln holds a wondrous, terrible secret. It will redefine life and intelligence as he knows it, and might just set him free . . .","Imagine if Jeff Vandermeer's Annihilation and Ursula K Le Guin's The Word For World is Forest had a baby. That's pretty damn close to what we got here with Alien Clay, and I adored it.This is a book about divergent evolution, symbiotic relationships in nature, revolution and uprising and yet, at the same time, becoming a part of the machine in which you live your life.It's full to the brim with Tchaikovsky-isms, with a liberal dose of body horror and all sorts of creepy alien insects and creatures.I'll admit it did take me a little while to get with the first-person perspective - it felt a little clunky and unnecessary at first, but it ended up working brilliantly and it had completely grown on me by the quarter way mark.

453,Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension,Poetry,"It’s easy to believe in the apocalypse when you’re losing your religion.NASA has assured everyone the passage of rogue planet Malachite will be safe, but Crosby's been getting other messages―from a fortune teller and Malachite truther message boards. And now she believes that Malachite will kill everyone who doesn’t ascend to the fourth dimension―a higher plane that transcends physicality.She tries to prepare her friends and family to leave their bodies behind and raise their frequency by changing their diets, wearing the right crystals, and moving into her friend’s bunker before it’s too late. But no one is listening.The more time she spends trying to talk her roommate and her quirky friends into her apocalypse plans, the more Crosby is forced to face the cracks in everything she believes to be true.This novel in verse explores the danger and humanity of conspiracy in a post-truth world through empathy, friendship, and forgiveness.","Not everything is an omen, Crosby. Not everything means something.Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a unique upper YA story told in verse about convictions so strong that they eventually lead to family and friends turning against each other and, in this case, believing in the end of the world. It reminded me sometimes of We Are the Ants by Shaun David Hutchinson (one of my favorite YA books ever), even though both stories are way different. Crosby is an anxious, shaky mess, distrustful, and balancing on the edge of reality and deeply held convictions. She believes firmly in witchcraft, and when her best friend Shannon buys earrings she likes (from Malachite), and Crosby tries to convince her those earrings are not the right match for her, they fall apart. Then, she’s in college and watches at a party through a telescope. When she sees the rogue dwarf planet Malachite, Colby is convinced Sharon’s earrings are a warning and that the planet is a message for something bad to happen.  The writing is beautiful and poetic and so fitting for a story like this. The characters are fully developed, and the descriptions are so vivid, I felt I was there, but even without them, I could read this book only for the writing, immersing myself in the words and the sentences, the cadence, and the rhythm. It’s soft and atmospheric while Crosby’s anxiety and the eeriness of her beliefs bubble under the surface but emerge more and more. Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a fantastic debut, and I can’t thank Rita Feinstein enough for asking me if I wanted to read an ARC. And thank you, Pagestreet YA, for sending me this ARC! Follow me on Instagram",4.0
454,The Midnight Library,Fiction,"Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————

455,Shadow Me,Fantasy,"Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces.The ending of Restore Me left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until Defy Me, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series.","Sooo I knew I loved Kenji Kishimoto..... but this book made me realize that I would rip my fucking heart out and put it on a platter for Kenji Kishimoto. I LOVED this installment!!!! I think this book was the perfect balance of exploring Kenji's voice, getting his funny inner monologue, learning more about the world, and seeing the events of Restore Me from his eyes. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bridge book between books 4 and 5 (honestly, these chapters could have been thrown in at the end of Restore Me because I actually think they better describe the events than Warner and Juliette did), but I still had SO much fun reading it and was laughing and gasping at all the new information and world building and conversations that we didn't see in Restore Me. I have a TON more to say about this with theories and new info reveals but it's 4:30 AM and I've been making my way through this book since midnight so my brain is just a big happy mush in my skull because I love Kenji so much and I adored this novella.Old reviewCONFIRMED KENJI POV!!!!!!!! I'm so stoked. Honestly, I wish this came sooner instead of just a month before Defy Me, but I'm not about to complain about more content.

456,The Institute,Horror,"In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win.--front flap","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

458,Sea of Tranquility,Fiction,"Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.'","“Isn’t that why we’re here? To leave a mark on wilderness?”
I was one of the few readers (or so it seemed) left underwhelmed by Mandel's Station Eleven when I read it back in 2014. The hype and gushing reviews seemed at odds with the very okay novel I read, which is why I passed on reading The Glass Hotel.Now I'm wondering: should I go back and read the author's other stuff? Because I have to admit I found Sea of Tranquility riveting and beautiful.From what I remember, it is not stylistically that different to Station Eleven-- both are quiet, slow-build stories-- but I found the characters here fascinating and the exploration of both the simulation theory and what, if anything, that means for humans, deeply moving. We begin with several chapters (or ""Parts"") of seemingly unrelated characters and stories, each set in a very different time and place-- Edwin arrives in Canada in the year 1912, Mirella goes to speak to the brother of an estranged old friend in 2020 NYC, Olive visits Earth for a book tour in 2203, scientists investigate the theory that the world is a simulation in 2401. Similar motifs appear in each story and it is clear they are linked, but how?As the stories weave together and overlap, we begin to see the recurring theme in each one until it all comes together in a big picture at the end.I really enjoyed it. There is this nostalgic quality to Mandel's writing that made me feel like I was revisiting places I'd been long ago, even though I obviously hadn't. I don't know if all the pandemic subplots were strictly necessary and I think the author could have achieved the same goal without that being a recurring theme, but this is a small complaint. The novel touches upon the big questions like the meaning of it all and the nature of reality, as well as exploring the human obsession with the end of the world:
“I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.”
And, in the end, it all seems to be saying that maybe there is no meaning, maybe none of it's real, whatever that means, maybe the world is always ending, and maybe the real question is: does it even matter?",4.0
459,A Psalm for the Wild-Built,Science Fiction,"ASIN B08H831J18 moved to the more recent editionCenturies before, robots of Panga gained self-awareness, laid down their tools, wandered, en masse into the wilderness, never to be seen again. They faded into myth and urban legend.Now the life of the tea monk who tells this story is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question of ""what do people need?"" is answered. But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how. They will need to ask it a lot. Chambers' series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter?","If this is not your first Becky Chambers book, you know what to expect. Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she’s been writing what I can only call “comfort science fiction/ cozypunk”, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that’s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, “For anybody who could use a break.”
 “This had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.”
  
It’s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times.
 “I’m tired,” Dex said softly. “My work doesn’t satisfy me like it used to, and I don’t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I’ve done it, I don’t know what to do next. I don’t know what I thought I’d find out here, because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I can’t stay here, but I’m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I’m scared, and I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
In this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other’s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  
This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato’s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea.
 “You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”
This is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia — and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers’ planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs.
 “Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.”
Yes, the questions Chambers raises are those “first world problems” that I’m usually the first one to want to shrug off — but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone — once that basic need has been fulfilled.
“Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”
All in all, it’s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day — but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  
————And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It’s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything — speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot — implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that “We don’t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value” — but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending — or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After “Ancillary Justice” series, I’m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant — that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It’s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it — Panga is pretty much “Pangaea”, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course — but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don’t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that’s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn’t among them. Maybe I’ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. 
“The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”“That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

460,Prophet Song,Fiction,"A fearless portrait of a society on the brink as a mother faces a terrible choice, from an internationally award-winning authorOn a dark, wet evening in Dublin, scientist and mother-of-four Eilish Stack answers her front door to find the GNSB on her step. Two officers from Ireland’s newly formed secret police are here to interrogate her husband, a trade unionist.Ireland is falling apart. The country is in the grip of a government turning towards tyranny and Eilish can only watch helplessly as the world she knew disappears. When first her husband and then her eldest son vanish, Eilish finds herself caught within the nightmare logic of a collapsing society.How far will she go to save her family? And what – or who – is she willing to leave behind?Exhilarating, terrifying and propulsive, Prophet Song is a work of breathtaking originality, offering a devastating vision of a country at war and a deeply human portrait of a mother’s fight to hold her family together.","At first, I thought it would be better to wait a while before I write anything about Prophet Song (2023) by Paul Lynch, just to calm down a little and catch my breath, but then I realized that my ability to build coherent sentences about this reading experience might diminish over time. I devoured this novel in two days. It trapped my attention from the first sentence and ensnared me at once.Prepare to have your emotions wrapped around Paul Lynch’s finger and the strings will be pulled tighter and tighter with every page. The thing I found most impressive about this novel is its atmosphere. The tension keeps growing gradually and the feeling of menace is more and more suffocating. The word exhilarating in the blurb baffled me as I found Prophet Song one of the darkest and most depressing books I have ever read. It depicts the rise of totalitarianism resulting in civil war, seen through the eyes of a family with four children. The novel is set in Ireland at an unspecified time but judging from the technology the characters are using it is contemporary. Bertolt Brecht's motto about the dark times was a perfect choice: the novel protagonist, Eilish, is akin to Mother Courage, dealing with unimaginable traumas. She does her best to keep her family together against all odds. By the way, Mother Courage's son is called Eilif which sounds so similar to Eilish. Both Brecht and Lynch's portrayals of motherhood in the time of moral apocalypse are heart-wrenching.The relief coming from the fact that Prophet Song is a dystopian novel doesn't last long as there is nothing unrealistic about the plot: the nightmarish events could have happened anytime, anywhere. Some passages hit unsettlingly close to home:  The government has taken control of the judiciary by putting their own people in, that’s the nub of the problem, once you get your own people in you can do whatever you like. Sounds exactly like Poland at the moment.Maybe one year and a half ago I would have found Paul Lynch's vision of totalitarianism overdrawn but the war in Ukraine proves that it's not. I couldn't stop thinking of Ukrainian children while reading passages like this: She whispers to him though there are no words for a child this age, no explanation for what has been done and yet what the child will never recall from memory will always be known by him and he will carry it as poison in the blood.Some reviewers complain about the oddity of Paul Lynch's style which is quite unusual indeed. For me, it was definitely this novel's forte. It blends detailed realistic descriptions with dreams and snippets of prose poetry. Prophet Song crushed me almost physically. I owe it a sleepless night. Maybe the concentration of bleakness and darkness in this novel is exaggerated. Sometimes it felt overwhelming, almost insufferable. On the other hand, this book is a clear warning and warnings are seldom whispered or painted with watercolours. It doesn’t take a prophet to foresee that Paul Lynch’s novel will make it to the Booker shortlist and may not stop there.Pablo Picasso, Mother and Child, c. 1951.",5.0
461,Recursion,Science Fiction,"That's what NYC cop Barry Sutton is learning, as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.That's what neuroscientist Helena Smith believes. It's why she's dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent.As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face to face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds, but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?At once a relentless pageturner and an intricate science-fiction puzzlebox about time, identity, and memory, Recursion is a thriller as only Blake Crouch could imagine it—and his most ambitious, mind-boggling, irresistible work to date.","Congratulations for winning of best sci-fi category from goodreads choice awards 2020! This is one of my favorite books of the year! Five OMG I’m suffering from brain cells bleeding and explosion of my last standing grey cells, what the hell I just read and who am I ? stars!I know the drill but let me rephrase one more time! This is not an easy, soft, sunshine and rainbows reading! In my opinion people who are brave enough to dive into this journey should put themselves an IQ test and discover their cognitive skills. ( luckily I read the quantum physics for dummies before the beginning but I feel like I can be great cast for future dumb and dumber movie if they will ever produce the third installment)So this book is amazing combination of time traveling, alternated lifetimes, Minority Reports meet Groundhog Day versus Black Mirror and Back to the Future kinda fascinating science fiction crashes into thriller and romance starting with an effective and memorable suicide attempt scene. A woman suffers from FMS ( false memory syndrome) who thinks her child was being erased, her husband denied her existence so there was nothing better than jump and end her life. But she had small hope in her heart, her husband could come to rescue her but when he didn’t show up, she didn’t want to fight anymore and.... Yes, this book starts with jaw dropping scene and you’re hooked! It’s addictive, unputdownable, nerve damaging, exhausting ride! You wanna know what’s going to happen and think about yourself if I had a chance to save my loved ones by turning back and making my wrongs turn into rights, what would happen! Saving her daughter from the traffic accident, curing your mother’s Alzheimer disease, prevention of school shooting , saving soldiers from the terrorist attacks are just the samples writer show as in alternative realities that have possible to be changed! The difference of Recursion from Dark Matter might be romance parts because I really enjoyed Barry and Helena’s love story. Not only they fought to bring universe into the right pattern but also they fought to get back together to be each other’s final word, everlasting love, end game! This was thrilling, mind bending, provoking book! Dark Matters is going to be Netflix series and I’m already sure that as a brain numbing project, this book finds its place at big screen on near future!Highly recommended, smart, different, unique and exquisite book but not for everyone!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
462,The First to Die at the End,Romance,"In this prequel to #1 New York Times bestselling phenomenon They Both Die at the End, two new strangers spend a life-changing day together after Death-Cast first makes their fateful calls.It’s the night before Death-Cast goes live, and there’s one question on everyone’s mind: Can Death-Cast actually predict when someone will die, or is it just an elaborate hoax?Orion Pagan has waited years for someone to tell him that he’s going to die. He has a serious heart condition, and he signed up for Death-Cast so he could know what’s coming.Valentino Prince is restarting his life in New York. He has a long and promising future ahead and he only registered for Death-Cast after his twin sister nearly died in a car accident.Orion and Valentino cross paths in Times Square and immediately feel a deep connection. But when the first round of End Day calls goes out, their lives are changed forever—one of them receives a call, and the other doesn’t.

463,The Testaments,Fiction,"When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of The Handmaid's Tale, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.With The Testaments, the wait is over.Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.In this brilliant sequel to The Handmaid's Tale, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.""Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."" --Margaret AtwoodAn alternate cover edition of ISBN 978-0385543781 can be found here.","I guess I'll have to be the one who says what nobody else is willing to say. This novel is terrible, and Booker judges are starstruck, hype-driven sellouts. And that no professional literary critic has the guts to tell the truth about how poorly conceived and written The Testaments is, is a true shame.  I can't decide which work Atwood should be embarrassed for more - Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 or The Testaments. The book doesn't read like a novel written by one of the most lauded authors of the 20st century. The Testaments reads like a standard-issue feminist YA dystopia, filled with every overused dystopian trope and every stereotype, penned by an author who writes for teen audience, and is published by Harper Teen. As such, it undoubtedly has some appeal to a part of Atwood's readership, but literary merit The Testaments has none. If this book had a different name on it, I would have DNFed it after 50 pages for its lack of originality, predictability and mediocre writing style. I’ve read a fair number of similar novels, I am not opposed to them, I enjoyed some of them, and some of them (for example the upcoming The Grace Year) held my attention much better. As an Atwood novel, The Testaments gets one disappointed, angry, heart-broken star from me. Why did the publishers embargo Atwood's new creation, I wonder? Surely there is nothing to spoil. Maybe to conceal its poor execution, or its transparent, shallow, simplistic, and ridiculous plot? The story is told from 3 POVs - Aunt Lydia's and two teen girls' - one growing up in Gilead and another - in Canada. Oh my, who those girls might be? Twist! You can only glimpse Atwood's former brilliance in Aunt Lydia's POV, but just for a few moments here and there. If the whole novel was written about Aunt Lydia, maybe Atwood would have made her journey more convincing, but alas. The other two girls are quintessential YA dystopian heroines - one abused by an evil oppressive regime, and the other - a bratty teen on the run from bad people, but who nevertheless has time for some romance. Yum! Like I said, these POVs are so similar to what's been regurgitated over and over in teen publishing, it's uncanny. Has The Testaments been partially ghost-written by Lauren Oliver? I am not trying to dump on Oliver, she has her fans and her place in the industry, but I expected something infinitely more sophisticated from Margaret Atwood.The new information about Gilead Atwood promised? Well, new details of Gilead made the regime more nonsensical and less plausible than ever before. Who benefits from living in Gilead becomes unfathomable in this book, thus making the entire concept pointless (kind of like in Wither). Totalitarian regimes work, at least temporarily, because they are supported by a mass of true believers. Where are they in this book? But if you yearn for some more torture porn in addition to that supplied by the 3 seasons of the TV show, then sure. Rapists, molesters, killers, suicide victims galore, plus solitary confinement - there is an overabundance of that. All of it written bluntly, rashly, exploitatively and without any kind of nuance. There is no overarching theme in The Testaments except GILEAD IS BAD. The plot to overthrow it is a joke. If you are looking for a clever, thoughtful, well-written companion to The Handmaid's Tale, you are out of luck. If you want a bland, basic TV show fanfic stuffed with action adventure and genre tropes, enjoy! The Testaments was written just for you.",1.0
464,Extinction,Thriller,"Erebus Resort, occupying a magnificent, hundred-thousand–acre valley deep in the Colorado Rockies, offers guests the experience of viewing woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths in their native habitat, brought back from extinction through the magic of genetic manipulation. When a billionaire's son and his new wife are kidnapped and murdered in the Erebus back country by what is assumed to be a gang of eco-terrorists, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Agent Frances Cash partners with county sheriff James Colcord to track down the perpetrators. As killings mount and the valley is evacuated, Cash and Colcord must confront an ancient, intelligent, and malevolent presence at Erebus, bent not on resurrection but on extinction.","In 
Extinction,
 Douglas Preston combines a technothriller with a police investigation. Erebus Resort occupies a large valley in Eagle County, Colorado, deep in the Rocky Mountains. It offers guests the unique experience of viewing six herbivores, including woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths, brought back from extinction through genetic manipulation. When billionaire Rolf Gunnerson’s son Mark and his wife Olivia are abducted while in the Erebus back county, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is called in to help the Eagle County sheriff’s department. This is Agent in Charge Frances Cash’s first case after her promotion to senior detective. She liaises with Sheriff James Colcord to investigate and tract down the culprits.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Cash is organized, detailed, goal-oriented, aggressive, foul-mouthed at times, sharp-tonged, and doesn’t like small talk. She’s viewed by her boss, McFaul, as lacking the public relations side of things and only being focused on solving her cases. Colcord is a movie buff, quiet, treats others with respect, and gets along with most people. However, he can also be forceful and take charge of situations.The author has penned a thriller with action, wonderful animals, plenty of adventure, great lead characters, and genetic engineering that is frightening, exciting, and thought-provoking. This riveting and suspenseful story kept be fully engaged from beginning to end. The plot is twisty with several shocking turns that caught me by surprise. The world-building was excellent from the back-country to the resort lodge to the laboratory. Themes include genetic engineering, deception, betrayal, death, greed, morality, work relationships, and much more.Overall, the book is tense, gripping, and suspenseful. It kept me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would be uncovered next. With great characterization and world-building as well as a fast pace, it’s also thought-provoking and terrifying at times. The afterward at the end of the book has some interesting information as well. I highly recommend this novel to those who enjoy thrillers, police procedurals, near-science science fiction, and mysteries. I hope there is a sequel. I purchased a copy of this novel.

If I had, I wouldn’t dump the body in the station mall.When Murderbot discovers a dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters to a lot of people—who knew?)Yes, the unthinkable is about to happen: Murderbot must voluntarily speak to humans!Again!","2021 is looking to be a pretty special year. No, I don’t mean the vaccine, although that’s pretty amazing. No, I mean Murderbot is back in a solid novella. While I’m contractually bound to not repeat the approximately 80 highlights I made while reading, I can assure you that it is filled with ‘Bot’s trademark sarcastic thoughts on humans, slow thought processes, and complicated facial expressions.""Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.""In Fugitive Telemetry, ‘Bot is on Preservation Station and has recently discovered a dead–cough, deceased–human.

In this case, it’s somewhat constrained from using full capabilities due to general unfriendliness of the human Station Security team and its honor system.

Or do I go for it?I think you know what I did.While I read, my day fell away, page by page, replaced by sarcastic observations and extremely dry wit. ‘Bot, how I’ve missed you. “I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit.”The only real question was how long until I re-read all the novellas?

466,Random in Death,Mystery,"In the new crime thriller from #1 New York Times -bestselling J.D. Robb, a small and easily concealed weapon wreaks havoc, and the killer is just a face in the crowd.Jenna’s parents had finally given in, and there she was, at a New York club with her best friends, watching the legendary band Avenue A, carrying her demo in hopes of slipping it to the guitarist, Jake Kincade. Then, from the stage, Jake catches her eye, and smiles. It’s the best night of her life.It’s the last night of her life.Minutes later, Jake’s in the alley getting some fresh air, and the girl from the dance floor comes stumbling out, sick and confused and deathly pale. He tries to help, but it’s no use. He doesn’t know that someone in the crowd has jabbed her with a needle―and when his girlfriend Nadine arrives, she knows the only thing left to do for the girl is call her friend, Lieutenant Eve Dallas.After everyone on the scene is interviewed, lab results show a toxic mix of substances in the victim’s body―and for an extra touch of viciousness, the needle was teeming with infectious agents. Dallas searches for a Had any boys been harassing Jenna? Was she engaging in risky behavior or caught up in something shady? But there are no obvious clues why this levelheaded sixteen-year-old, passionate about her music, would be targeted.And that worries Dallas.

Random in Death
 by J. D. Robb (pseudonym for Nora Roberts). This well-written futuristic police procedural is set in New York City (NYC) in the summer of 2061 and features Lieutenant Eve Dallas with the NYC homicide police department. Sixteen-year-old Jenna Harbough has finally gotten parental approval to watch her favorite band play live at a club. Her idol Jake Kincaid catches her eye while she’s on the dance floor. It’s the best night of her life. Minutes later she stumbles outside and dies. Eve is called to the scene. Was Jenna targeted specifically or was she a random victim?Time spent with Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody (Eve’s partner), and Eve’s colleagues is always entertaining. The main characters are compelling and three-dimensional. Eve is honorable, honest, has strong moral principles, and has a strong sense of duty to victims and their families. Her need to serve and protect comes through in every book, but the underlying impetus for this is best understood by reading this series in order. As always, the interactions between Eve and Roarke are enjoyable and bring a different facet of Eve’s personality to light. It’s fascinating to see how Eve’s mind works getting a better and better picture of the killer. I enjoyed seeing Peabody continue to take on more responsibility in this story line as well as Detective Jenkinson. Readers get to see a bit of the private lives of Peabody and her significant other, McNab. Additionally, Nadine Furst and Jake Kincade share more of the limelight in this novel.It is amazing that after fifty-eight books this author can still use prose to elicit a strong emotional response from readers. The novel has a deeply involved plot that is thought-provoking and tragic. Robb weaves humor into her novels, providing levity to offset some of the more serious and grim aspects of the story. She brings strong characters, great plots, wonderful relationships, and excellent pacing to the series. Woven through the novel are threads of caring for others, standing for victims, friendship, relationships, ego, justice, leadership, love, respect, and trust. Additionally, there are themes of murder, shock, denial, grief, power, rage, dominance, punishment, arrogance, and much more.Robb is an excellent storyteller who combines a creative plot with suspenseful scenes, lots of solid police investigation, and some action. The writing is fluid and the ever-present threat that was looming kept me rapidly turning the pages. Besides the investigation, Dallas’s solid investigative techniques and her relationships with her friends and colleagues drive the narrative. It has the right balance of mystery, police investigation, romance, and creative twists.Overall, this novel was a twisty tale with great characterization that kept me engaged throughout the story. If you enjoy engaging near-future police procedurals, then I recommend this series. This is the fifty-eighth book in the In Death Eve Dallas series and I have read all of them up to this point. I can’t wait to read the next book in the series.St. Martin’s Press and J.D. Robb provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.

Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.","In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.",5.0
470,Ender’s Game,Science Fiction,"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","DNF at 52%Dear Orson Scott Card,There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.Sincerely, Women. Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you. Sincerely, Kat. First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;""All the boys are organized into armies.""""All boys?""""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?  2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. Plot Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" Sure. Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. It--just--ugh. It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.",1.0
471,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,Science Fiction,"Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker's Guide (""A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have"") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? Why do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick your thumb to the stars. And don't forget to bring a towel!","In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.",5.0
472,The Martian,Science Fiction,"Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?","I’m pretty much fucked.
Ok, show of hands. How many of you have uttered these exact words? (or words to that effect). Not everyone? I see we have some liars out there. How many have said them at least twice? Three times? Four? Those with hands still up, you probably need to make some adjustments to your approach, find a safer line of work, hobbies that do not entail long drops, stop trying the weekly specials at McBlowfish, or seek out people to date who are into less extreme…um…sports. These are the opening words of The Martian. Astronaut Mark Watney is definitely more screwed than most of us have ever been. Dude missed his ride and there will not be another along for, oh, four years. Supplies on hand were only meant to cover a few weeks, maybe months. And that Martian atmosphere is definitely no fun, lacking stuff like, oh, breathable air, and a reasonable range of temperature. It does, offer, however, extremely harsh (good for scouring that burned on gunk from sauce pans) and long-lasting (as in months) dust storms. And if that was not enough he faces an array of other challenges. unfriendly locals No, Kibby (the 12-year-old kibitzer who infects my brain), no Mars Attacks brain beasts, or that other guy, even though I know he is your favorite. Real challenges. For example, the music he has for his stay consists of disco. The viewing options include 70s TV. Most of us might give serious consideration to minimizing the guaranteed pain, frustration, starvation and inevitable death by, maybe, taking a short hustle outside sans that special suit. It would be a very, very short last dance. Watney is either a cock-eyed optimist or an idiot. I'm going with the former, as he is indeed made of the right stuff. He is armored and well supplied with the sort of can-do designer genes that might make the rest of us feel like the can’t-do sorts we are. He is the poster boy for positive attitude. It does not hurt that he is way smart, with expertise in a wide-enough range of things scientific to matter. It does not hurt that he is an engineer who gets off on taking apart, putting back-together, figuring out, thinking through, testing, trying, and pushing envelopes. But his crew is headed home, and what hope is there, really?The Martian tells of Watney’s attempt to survive in a literally alien environment, using only the tools on hand and his wits. It is a gripping story with one of the most adorable heroes you are likely to encounter, on this planet or any other. (No, Kibby, not a kitten) How could you not root for a guy who scrapes through Thanksgiving dinner for potato parts to plant for food? Of course, one might think “been there, done that,” particularly as 1964’s  Robin Crusoe on Mars  offered a retelling of Daniel Defoe’s classic tale in a more contemporary notion of a remote locale. A 1905 novel used a different classic traveler in the same sort of format. Of course those tellings had a lot more in common with the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs as seen by Frank Frazetta than they do with the vision we have of the Red Planet today, or, say, reality. RealityOr is it?One of these was a shot of you know where. The other was taken at Death Valley, which was used, BTW, in the filming of Robinson Crusoe on MarsMost of the tale is spent on Watney’s very compelling attempt to survive, going through all the challenges he faces trying to make air, preserve and maybe generate water, make his food last, get some sort of communication set up, deal with things like exploding air-locks, biblical level dust-storms, toppling ground-transport vehicles, you know, stuff, most of it life-threatening. The other end of things is how the folks on the ground deal with this GInornous OOPS. There are technical elements, of course but more interesting, for me, were the political considerations. To tell the crew or not? Imagine how bummed out, embarrassed, and guilty you might be on that ship (the Hermes) returning home, knowing you had left one behind. Might it affect your ability to take care of necessary business for the next bunch of months? Another question is whether to tell the public, and if so, when. How about getting help from other space-capable nations? Are any international dealings simple? There is also some in-house (NASA) staff maneuvering that is wonderful to see.Andy WeirIn her fabulous book on writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes
Having a likeable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud…
Probably the greatest strength of The Martian is the narration of Mark Watney. He is engaging and funny, optimistic and capable. I suppose there are some who might find him lacking in sharp edges, but I thought he worked great. Matt Damon as Mark Watney, enjoying the view  – from the film. The new earth-based shooting location was Wadi Rum, Jordan. I am sure they did plenty of color adjustments in post, but boy-o-boy does this place look like an alien landscape. GripesYes, really, there is too much scientific detail. It is not that it is beyond the comprehension of a lot of readers (although it will skip by a fair number) it is the share of time, the number of pages, the sheer volume of obstacles to be overcome, and the very detailed explanation of so many of them that tilts the book a bit too much towards the MacGyver demo. Weir writes very well about the other elements of the story. Repetition of DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, with the subsequent amazingly clever repair du jour, does get a bit old after a while. I had to fight an urge to scan at times. But that is really it. Otherwise, The Martian is an absolute delight to read. Watney is lovable as well as capable, and makes excellent use of his sense of humor to look on the bright side of life, in a very dark circumstance. Whether he makes it out on time or not (not gonna spoil that one) you will cheer him on, hope for the best, and fly past those pages with considerable, if maybe not interplanetary, speed. Is there life on Mars? There will be while you read this book.

Fortunately, we’ve got the OASIS.”“What’s that?”“It’s this virtual reality that’s kind of a combination of the Internet and the biggest MMORPG ever made. Here put this on, and I’ll show you.”“Hey, this is pretty sweet, Wade. But what’s with all this old stuff here in your virtual room. It looks like the ‘80s vomited in here.”“Oh, it’s part of my research for the contest. See the guy who invented the OASIS was this old nerd named James Halliday. He left an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS and whoever finds it wins the prize. He was totally obsessed with the ‘80s and nerdly stuff like computers, sci-fi, cartoons, movies, comics and video games. He left three keys to three gates hidden in here, and the clues have to be stuff that he loved. So a lot of people like me have to know all about the '80s to hunt for the egg.""“How long has this been going on?”“For years now. Nobody has found the first key yet.”“And you what? Watch movies from the ‘80s? Listen to the music? Read his favorite books? Play old video games?”“It‘s even bigger than that. Because of the contest, the entire world is obsessed with the ‘80s. The clothes and hairstyles are considered cool again.”“Really? Well, I gotta get the hell out of here then. Thanks for showing me this, Wade. How do I log out?”“You’re leaving already? Don’t you want to…Oh, my god! You said you were from 2011? And you’re in your 40s, right?”“Well, just barely…”“So you actually lived through the ‘80s?”“Afraid so. High school class of 1988.”“That’s awesome! You gotta tell me all about it, Kemper.”“Kid, why would you want to hear about that? You’re sitting here with enough computer power to download everything from the collected works of Shakespeare to the entire run of The Wire and you want to hear about the ’80s? Just for a contest?”“I love the ’80s. It was the coolest time ever!”“Uh, not really. In fact, I think the ’90s beat the shit out of them. That not worrying about the Cold War thing was a relief and the music was a lot better. Plus we got to wear flannel. That was fun.”“But… you got to play the old video games in the actual arcades, and you saw the first generation of home computers come out. Plus, music videos and John Hughes movies and Rubik’s Cubes and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album and….”“Yeah, Wade. I lived through it all. I remember when MTV played music videos and when Eddie Murphy was funny. But you’re making me sad, kid.”“Why?”“Lemme tell you a story, Wade. About ten years after I got out of high school, an old buddy I had stayed in touch with had a birthday bash and invited a bunch of us that used to run around together. So we’re at his house drinking and playing cards just like the old days and catching up and playing ‘Remember when?”. It was a lot of fun, but we’d been listening to hair metal and classic rock all night, and at one point, I was flipping through the CD’s.”“Actual CD’s! Not downloads?”“Hell, I’m so old even my post-high school stories are dated now. Yes, Wade, real CD’s. Anyhow, I found a new Foo Fighters album, and I put it in. And this one guy made a face and asked me why I had taken the Guns-n-Roses out. And I said something like the nostalgia had been fun but I needed something from that decade. Being completely serious he said that he didn’t know how I could listen to that stuff, and that he still listened to the same exact music we did in high school. He had just replaced his old cassettes with CD’s. The guy had completely managed to miss grunge and was perfectly happy with the same play list in 1998 that he’d been listening to in 1988. And that was one of the saddest things I ever heard, Wade.”“But maybe he just really liked that stuff.”“I liked it too, once upon a time. And I can still belt out a pretty good version of Relax when Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on the radio, but it was a certain time and place. Now it’s done. I find it depressing that someone of Gen X would want to be stuck there and never moved on to anything new. But it got worse after that, Wade. Because we got older and then the media started catering to us by going for nostalgia trips on everything from trying to remake the Knight Rider TV show to shitty movies like The Transformers and G.I. Joe to the goddamn Smurfs. I’m tired of it in 2011, Wade. I don’t want a new Indiana Jones movie, I want the NEXT Indiana Jones. But no one is working on that because all of us got obsessed with regurgitating our childhoods over and over.”“That is kind of sad, Kemper.”“What’s even sadder is seeing it happen to a generation that didn’t even live through it. When I was a teenager, I got sick to death of baby boomer nostalgia and there’d be these kids my age who tried to be like damn dirty hippies by wearing tie-dye shirts and going to listen to Grateful Dead tribute bands. They were nostalgic for an era that wasn’t even theirs, and I always thought it was a waste. Don’t be like that, Wade. You seem like a nice kid. Don’t sit here watching Family Ties reruns and playing Space Invaders and making jokes about Ewoks. That was then. This is now. It’s your time and you should be out there trying to find the stuff that will become part of your own memories of growing up, not rehashing ours.”“Gee, Kemper. That’s a really good point. You’ve opened my eyes. Thanks a lot.”“You’re welcome, Wade. By the way, what the hell was this prize that was so good that it got the entire world doing the safety dance again?”“Oh, the winner gets the controlling interest in Halliday’s company and his personal fortune which is about $240 billion dollars.”“Did you say $240 billion? Dollars?”“Yes, so how about we log off. Maybe I’ll take a walk and see if I can find this girl I like. I’ve been…”“Screw that. Fire this rig up, Wade. Put on some Def Leppard and find me a pair of acid washed jeans and some high top Reeboks. Let’s start looking for clues. For $240 billion I’ll live through the ‘80s again.”**************************************************I didn’t actually hate this book. It did a lot of very clever stuff regarding an entire virtual universe. And for a member of Gen X, it was a fast and fun romp down memory lane. It was kind of like Snow Crash meets the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie.But I’ve got a personal pet peeve against people trying to live in the past and since this book is nostalgia porn*, the basic premise did rub me the wrong way. The idea that the kids of the 2040s are just watching episodes of ‘80s TV shows and playing Donkey Kong really kind of depressed me. *I stole that phrase from Flannery’s review. Sorry, Flannery! It was just too good.I might have been able to get past it a little easier if at least one of the kids said something like, “Jesus, I hate this ‘80s bullshit. I can’t wait until his freakin’ contest is over so I can live in the here and now.” But instead all of them treat it like it’s the greatest entertainment ever. So even though a few post ’80s things like Firefly or the Lord of the Rings movies get mentioned, we’re supposed to believe that nerd pop culture reached a zenith in the ’80s and nothing worth geek obsession happened between 1990 and 2040? Sorry, but that seems kind of unlikely and the kind of wishful thinking that an aging Gen Xer would write as he pines for his glory days.",1.0
474,Fahrenheit 451,Fiction,"Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.","As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing.",2.0

476,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't...

477,Brave New World,Classics,"Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New Worldd likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. ""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune","I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.

This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like... 

Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...

The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...

Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.3.0 Stars. Recommended.",3.0
478,Foundation,Science Fiction,"Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.","Honestly, I don't get why this book/series is so popular. There are some interesting elements to it (for instance, the use of religion as a tool of mass control and the implicit resultant argument that religion is no more than a fraud, ""the opiate of the people,"" after all), but the book gave me little to enjoy or dig into. The forces of the novel are broad, historical, dealing with masses of people; this means that there is little to no room for individual characters here and little to be done by the few characters who do appear. One leader says, in fact, in response to a crisis, the threat of warfare and annihilation, ""I'm going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis"" (191). This is a recurring theme. Plus, there are no female characters to speak of. One man's wife makes a brief and apparently unnecessary appearance for a page-long chapter, but that's it. All else is done by and to men.There are a couple of minor things I do like about the book. One is Salvor Hardin's statement that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" which I like for its endorsement of nonviolent alternatives. Another is the characters' habit of saying ""Space"" or ""Galaxy"" instead of God when they exclaim or curse.",2.0

With High King Cardan and High Queen Jude willing to use any means necessary to retrieve their stolen heir, Oak will have to decide whether to attempt regaining the trust of the girl he’s always loved or to remain loyal to Elfhame and hand over the means to end her reign—even if it means ending Wren, too.   With a new war looming on the horizon and treachery lurking in every corner, neither Oak’s guile nor his wit will be enough to keep everyone he loves alive.

483,The Morningside,Fiction,"From the critically beloved, New York Times bestselling author of The Tiger's Wife and Inland, a magical novel of mothers and daughters, displacement and belonging, and myths both old and new.There’s the world you can see. And then there’s the one you can’t. Welcome to the Morningside.After being expelled from their ancestral home, Silvia and her mother finally settle at the Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family's past. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she know why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia's lonely and impoverished reality.Enchanted by Ena’s stories, Silvia begins seeing the world with magical possibilities and becomes obsessed with the mysterious older woman who lives in the penthouse of the Morningside. Bezi Duras is an enigma to everyone in the building. She has her own elevator entrance and leaves only to go out at night and walk her three massive hounds, often not returning until the early morning. Silvia’s mission to unravel the truth about this woman’s life, and her own haunted past, may end up costing her everything.Startling, inventive, and profoundly moving, The Morningside is a novel about the stories we tell—and the stories we refuse to tell—to make sense of where we came from and who we hope we might become.","The Morningside by Téa Obreht is a Family and Literary Fiction Story Sprinkled With Magical Realism and Set in a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic World! 
Holy-Moly! There's a lot going on in this story...
Silvia knows little about where she's from, why they had to leave, or why her mother keeps their past so secretive. The only thing she knows is now they're living at The Morningside, an aging luxury high-rise in Island City where her Aunt Ena has lived and worked for the past ten years.  Silvia loves her conversations with Aunt Ena, who feeds her imagination with stories about the homeland she doesn't remember. Silvia becomes enamored by Ena's tales and her imagination spills over with thoughts about the mysterious resident living in the penthouse. She makes it her focus to discover the truth about this woman's life... The Morningside is a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic story written in the first-person narrative of curious eleven-year-old Silvia. Silvia is quiet, bright, and observant and possesses keen senses for a child her age. Perhaps it's due to being raised by a mother who shares little that Silvia is driven to find answers on her own. Silvia meets two individuals she develops friendships with and it's through these connections the story becomes more about the characters and relationships and less about the changing world described in Obreht's lovely writing. The story can feel cramped with melodrama and distractions, jumping from one catastrophe to the next, and taking abrupt turns through unexpected decisions by the characters. For me, it added additional layers and interest.The Morningside is creative and original storytelling about a mother-daughter relationship, finding family, and discovering your place in the world. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a well-written character-driven Family and Literary Fiction story with touches of Magical Realism like I do. I plan to look at Téa Obreht's backlist for more to read while I wait for her next book!4⭐Thank you to Random House and Téa Obreht for a physical ARC, and a DRC of this book through NetGalley. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review. Due to publish 3/19/24!",4.0
484,The Day Tripper,Time Travel,"It’s 1995, and Alex Dean has it all: a spot at Cambridge University next year, the love of an amazing woman named Holly and all the time in the world ahead of him. That is until a brutal encounter with a ghost from his past sees him beaten, battered and almost drowning in the Thames.He wakes the next day to find he’s in a messy, derelict room he’s never seen before, in grimy clothes he doesn’t recognize, with no idea of how he got there. A glimpse in the mirror tells him he’s older—much older—and has been living a hard life, his features ravaged by time and poor decisions. He snatches a newspaper and finds it’s 2010—fifteen years since the fight.After finally drifting off to sleep, Alex wakes the following morning to find it’s now 2019, another nine years later. But the next day, it’s 1999. Never knowing which day is coming, he begins to piece together what happens in his life after that fateful night by the river.But what exactly is going on? Why does his life look nothing like he thought it would? What about Cambridge, and Holly? In this thrilling adventure, Alex must navigate his way through the years to learn that small actions have untold impact. And that might be all he needs to save the people he loves and, equally importantly, himself.","The story in this book starts in 1995 when Alex Dean is a young man who met the love of his life and has a bright future ahead of him. Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion. It leaves us to wonder and analyze our own lives to decide that we made the best decisions in the course of it.",4.0

She is trained to be an assassin and goes through much abuse by the queen’s right hand. I found her to be an extremely likable and relatable heroine. She’s learning who she is as a woman and discovering herself. While also having to discover the truth because everyone is spinning a different tale. She’s strong, fierce, funny, but also vulnerable and wants to feel true love.Rogan is her childhood best friend and the prince who is betrothed to the princess. He always showed her kindness and as they grew older they fell in love with each other. But due to political reasons he did not choose her and this broke Fia. Do I dislike Rogan? Yes and no. He’s a product of his environment and has been fed lies distorting his beliefs. During their mission feelings com back and confuses the lines of their friendship. I believe he does love Fia in his own way but not all parts of her.Irian aka shadow daddy 🤪 is mysterious, dangerous, powerful and full of secrets. Something about a man that tries to kill you upon meeting is kind of hot ..talk about a meet-cute 🤭 I will fall hard for any morally gray character it’s a natural given..I’m hoping in the next book we get more information about him he’s an intriguing character. I loved their moments together he loves Fia fiercely and allows her to be herself.

I received a copy of If the Tide Turns by Rachel Rueckert from Kensington Publishing and Edelweiss Plus in exchange for an honest review. The well written debut novel is told from the points of view of Maria and Sam and inspired by a real-life pirate Sam Bellamy. The reader's given an idea of what piracy was really like in the early 1700's, life in Colonial America, use of herbal medicine, banishment of women, evils of slavery and the plight of the Native American Wampanoag people. An historical saga about the lure of the sea, overcoming obstacles, young love and four stars from me.",4.0

488,Floating Hotel,Science Fiction,"Welcome to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury—and an absolute magnet for intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently—who is driving the ship? Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves. At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl, one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question: when is it time to let go?","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

489,Song of the Huntress,Fantasy,"The acclaimed author of Sistersong transforms the story of Herla and the Wild Hunt into a rich, feminist fantasy in this stunning tale of two great warriors, a war-torn land, and an ancient magic that is slowly awakening.Britain, 60AD. Hoping to save her lover, her land, and her people from the Romans, Herla makes a desperate pact with the king of the Otherworld. But years pass unheeded in his realm, and she escapes to find everyone she loved long dead. Cursed to wield his blade, she becomes Lord of the Hunt. And for centuries, she rides, leading her immortal warriors and reaping wanderers’ souls. Until the night she meets a woman on a bloody battlefield—a Saxon queen with ice-blue eyes.Queen Æthelburg of Wessex is a proven fighter. But when she leads her forces to disaster in battle, her husband’s court turns against her. Yet King Ine needs Æthel more than ever. Something dark and dangerous is at work in the Wessex court. His own brother seeks to usurp him. And their only hope is the magic in Ine’s bloodline that’s lain dormant since ancient days.The moment she and Æthel meet, Herla knows it’s no coincidence. The dead kings are waking. The Otherworld seeks to rise, to bring the people of Britain under its dominion. And as Herla and Æthel grow closer, Herla must find her humanity—and a way to break the curse—before it’s too late.","The stronger aspect of this book is also its biggest weakness: the writing is pretty and has a good rhythm overall, but it's also prone to archaisms and the occasional purple-prosery; and it uses third person present tense narration for a POV, too, which some readers don't enjoy, me amongst them. On top of that, the pace of the story is so painfully slow it's very tempting to abandon the book for the slow-as-molasses progress and the unnecessary roundabouts. It makes the book easy to put down and resume later, yes, but also very easy to forget.Set in 8th century Britain, Song of the Huntress has a trio of protagonists: Herla, the leader of the Wild Hunt, Æthelburg, Queen of Wessex, and Ine, King of Wessex, and pretends to be a character-driven story of struggle, personal growth, and power, faith, and politics in times when Anglo-Saxons vie for the rule of the new lands they conquer and conflict arises between the old and the new religions. If you're interested in this time period, the historical novel with low magic feel of this book should be far more enjoyable to you than if you aren't, as is my case. But regardless of personal investment in the period, it's probably the characters that'll hold your interest most, although for me it didn't work that way either as it was very hard to connect or care about them for how unrelatable and distant they felt. I did find Ine a tad more interesting as a character than either Herla or Æthelburg, though, who are a bit more stereotypical (in the ""strong women"" cliché sense), mainly because it's the first time I see a man of that era struggling with asexuality and it was intriguing to see. Historically accurate? No, not really, pre-modern views and understanding of sexuality weren't like ours, which is why I find the much-lauded queer representation here rather forced, but your mileage may vary, as they say.There's really not much else to say, it really was this dull for me personally; little happening, much describing, and characterisation that could've been much more fetching.

In the industrial city of Theumas, she is seen not as a healer, but a monster that kills for pleasure.When Nhika is caught using her bloodcarving abilities during a sham medical appointment, she's captured by underground thugs and sold to an aristocratic family to heal the last witness of their father’s murder.But as Nhika delves deeper into their investigation amidst the glitz of Theumas’ wealthiest district, she begins to notice parallels between this job and her own dark past. And when she meets an alluring yet entitled physician's aide, Ven Kochin, she’s forced to question the true intent behind this murder. In a society that outcasts her, Kochin seems drawn to her...though he takes every chance he gets to push her out of his opulent world.When Nhika discovers that Kochin is not who he claims to be, and that there is an evil dwelling in Theumas that runs much deeper than the murder of one man, she must decide where her heart, and her allegiance, truly lie.

As often is the case, Nhika falls into the trap of being naïve and cliché. She is hoodwinked by multiple people, before coming into her own.As the wave of Vietnamese diaspora fiction continues to hit the shelves, I have been eagerly waiting for more Southeast Asian lore to make its way into my hands. Since I grew up in the West, inundated with Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, and am slowly but surely educating myself on East Asian lore, I find myself searching for the myths of my homeland. This is a start. (Make sure you pick up The Crossbow of Destiny in August.)Where so many of the Asian fantasies seem to go wrong is the glorification of colonization. I will be the first to admit that I was worried about how this would turn out. Fear not, Nhika is very proud to be Yarongese. As she was born in Theumas, she has never even seen her oft dreamt about homeland. She barely speaks the language. She feels unconnected to her mother and grandmother's land and healing practices. This obviously hit me in the feels.Nhika's gift deals with healing. She is from a land of magic. The place she lives deals more with science, and these people see her as other. Deep in this underworld of training and secrets, she meets a dark haired mysterious stranger. Again, fret not. I'm eager to see how the author will continue this story.🎧 NetGalley",4.0

One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0
495,The Wicked King,Fantasy,"You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.The first lesson is to make yourself strong.After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★

“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”

Many of you might not know this but on this day many years ago, Holly Black’s biggest fan was born. Spoiler: it’s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn’t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I’m just that extra, but The Wicked King is perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I’ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. But every time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I’d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too. The Wicked King is the second installment in The Folk of the Air series, the first being my favorite book of 2017, The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So, please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled for The Cruel Prince!

“I want to tell you so many lies.”

(The most breathtaking fanart by Loweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is *clutches pearls forever* the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn’t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them. 

“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”

And everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase “twists and turns” doesn’t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won’t know who or what to believe, and you surely won’t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page. And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren’t wrong. You all thought The Cruel Prince cliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won’t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I’m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I’ve ever read in my entire life. Okay, I’m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also, Roiben plays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it! (My favorite fanart(s) by PhantomRin!)➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love. 

“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I’m so sorry, neighbors, if you’re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of “book boyfriends” until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - I’m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I’ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he’s going to be the “big bad” of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play. 

“I wish he hadn’t used me to test my sister’s love for him. I wish she hadn’t let him.”

➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I’m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella, The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it’s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I’m ready for it. Oh, and in case I haven’t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don’t say that lightly. I thought in The Cruel Prince that it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while reading The Wicked King I realized that it’s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you’ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don’t even know how I’m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical. 

“You are my dearest punishment.”

But this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it’s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully. 

“It’s easy to put your own life on the line, isn’t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.”

I’m not sure I’ve ever been as happy reading a book as I’ve been reading The Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It’s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word. 

“He looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don’t. We don’t share anything.”

Overall, this review doesn’t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos, Frank Ocean, and The Wicked King by Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it’s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I’d just ask for more.

496,The Queen of Nothing,Fantasy,"Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold onto. Jude learned this lesson when she released her control over the wicked king, Cardan, in exchange for immeasurable power. Now as the exiled mortal Queen of Faerie, Jude is powerless and left reeling from Cardan’s betrayal. She bides her time determined to reclaim everything he took from her. Opportunity arrives in the form of her deceptive twin sister, Taryn, whose mortal life is in peril.Jude must risk venturing back into the treacherous Faerie Court, and confront her lingering feelings for Cardan, if she wishes to save her sister. But Elfhame is not as she left it. War is brewing. As Jude slips deep within enemy lines she becomes ensnared in the conflict’s bloody politics. And, when a dormant yet powerful curse is unleashed, panic spreads throughout the land, forcing her to choose between her ambition and her humanity… From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black, comes the highly anticipated and jaw-dropping finale to The Folk of the Air trilogy.","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★2.) The Wicked King ★★★★★

“By you, I am forever undone.”

I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending. Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.) I vlogged this entire reading experience (and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened in The Cruel Prince, The Lost Sisters, & The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later! After the very heartbreaking end of The Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter. 

“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”

Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death. It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted. 

“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”

And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence. 

“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”

Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly. This next section of my review is going to have SPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not read The Queen of Nothing and all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart. 

“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”

➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. 

“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - We love a good redemption arc, wow. ➽ 
 Grima Mog
 - Nothing but love and respect for my war general. ➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers. ➽ 
 Vivi
 - My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking. ➽ 
 Oak
 - Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off. ➽ 
 Madoc
 - Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup. Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying. I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that. 

“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”

I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read. I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie. I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me. Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the way The Folk of the Air has made me feel.

497,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,Young Adult,"It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.The odds are against him. He's been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined -- every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute... and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.","For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,  I loved it shamelessly,  warts and all .And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe (I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty? 
I think this book will alienate quite a few of Hunger Games fans. You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. But The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become. You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here (or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes). I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But he has some humanity in him - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice. The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it. He chooses complicity — and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey. 
 “So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”
 
This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.
 “We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”
It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it only as far as it suits his comfort. Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.
 “His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”
No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can reread The Hunger Games trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.

  y'allll when I tell you this line made me- ALEXA PLAY LITERALLY ANY LOVE SONG BY TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE EVAJACKS ARE EVERYTHING AND SO IS TAYLOR SWIFT.(there will be spoilers if you haven't read this book so be wary!)Ok so here we finally are. The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don't even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It's gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it's not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I'll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo's first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke: “He'd never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks's chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let's just say, that's definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let's just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that's true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I'm pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it's cute, because it wasn't, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won't be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I'm still bitter that Tella didn't pop up in a cameo. I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I've already written so much so here's my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much was because of the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she's a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn't as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won't get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I'm messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts's mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don't end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼‍♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don't matter or aren't important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks's story is so good, I can't even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I'm all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn't paying much attention, sooo when I'm less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I'm ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars

499,Lightlark,Fantasy,"Welcome to the Centennial. Every 100 years, the island of Lightlark appears to host the Centennial, a deadly game that only the rulers of six realms are invited to play. The invitation is a summons—a call to embrace victory and ruin, baubles and blood. The Centennial offers the six rulers one final chance to break the curses that have plagued their realms for centuries. Each ruler has something to hide. Each realm’s curse is uniquely wicked. To destroy the curses, one ruler must die.Isla Crown is the young ruler of Wildling—a realm of temptresses cursed to kill anyone they fall in love with. They are feared and despised, and are counting on Isla to end their suffering by succeeding at the Centennial.To survive, Isla must lie, cheat, and betray…even as love complicates everything.","EDIT 8/17/2022As someone who dropped one of the first comprehensive bad reviews on this book, I just wanna say I do not support the review bombing of it. It’s tacky and uncouth and what bigots do every time there are women in a TV show. We’re better than this. This situation could been a constructive conversation about the quality of a book, privileges, the highly commercialized state of publishing, the influence of tiktok, or false advertising, and instead we’re having NONE of those. Do not invalidate anyone’s identity. This is unproductive and invasive speculation. Focus on actions, on stuff that’s actually happening. C’mon, be real. _____________________I rarely use GoodReads, but because I received an advanced copy of the book, I thought it best to distribute this review across all platforms where I have an account. You can find me over on the storygraph, username bean. Thanks for the arc btw!Where to begin?I picked up this book because of tiktok. This book got picked up by a publisher because of tiktok. This book is a tiktok success story, an amalgamation of all that tiktok has to offer, and by extension, all the books that are popular on tiktok before it. Calling it pastiche would be kind. Each scene felt very reminiscent of something out of another YA book. Many, many YA books. So much of this book is borrowed from ACOTAR that any differentiation from the plot of ACOTAR felt like a subversion of story even if it made perfect sense within Lightlark's narrative. Also, I can proudly say that any comparison to the Hunger Games is unwarranted. It's a terrible comparison that sets up false expectations. More accurately, it's ACOTAR meets the Selection. Yeah. Before I really lay into this book, I'll say that I understand why people would like it. I understand the appeal. Some people like reading 100 different versions of the same kind of book. I get it. It's comforting. I am also that way with certain genres of books or types of movies. But comfort, familiarity, they're not tangible measures of storytelling quality. It's possible to be comforted and find excitement in something that suffers from flaws. So, make peace with that.I'll work my way up.The building blocks of story are prose. Aster's prose is not bad, but undercooked and sometimes repetitive. Unique metaphors are one-hit wonders, if you pull them out again, we will notice (hair like ink on his brow, buttery sunlight). It does not read like fantasy prose and feels entirely too modern. That was a problem deeper than prose, but certainly evident in the writing style. I had the privilege of consuming this novel on audiobook, and without the narrator, many writing faults would be more evident. (Also, I don't know how to spell any of these names because I read it on audiobook. So sorry for that.)That being said, it is consumable. I could get through it. I feel like I had an okay sense of where the characters were spacially. I knew where they were mentally because the author would just tell us. It's a common vice in Young Adult. The blatant explanations of Isla's struggle in her internal monologue and the faux femininist ideology of this book that would've been standard in the early 2010s really highlighted Sarah J Maas' writing as inspiration. Which kind of sucks, because her prose isn't good either.Now onto the premise. There are six rulers of six different realms trying to break their curses by competing in a Centennial, a game that takes place on an island that only emerges every hundred years. Simple enough? No it isn't.Listen, I am a seasoned fantasy reader. More than that, I was a Supernatural fan in my heyday. I have made sense of many things that do not make sense.This book did not make sense.First and foremost, it's impossible to get a real grasp on stakes. These lands have been suffering with their curses for five hundred years. And some of the curses are gnarly! The wildling's curse is that they have to eat a human heart every month to survive. But then, the people here live to be very old? Which, presumably means that they don't have very many children. The population can't be that high, because it wouldn't be sustainable if people are living longer. So how do they have even a year's supply of hearts? It's explained to us that the wildlings are dying, that their realm is losing power, that they don't have enough hearts to sustain them, but it's so hard to have a good grasp on exactly what's going on because there are so many variables that are vaguely explained. Are they at half their power, a tenth? How big are they compared to other realms? How many people do they lose a year? We need to understand the stakes! Please!For example, both of the love interests in this thing are over 500 years old. Yet, the starling curse is that their people don't live past the age of 25. How- I can't even wrap my head around it. In a world where people are living centuries, you give them a quarter of one, and barely explain its repercussions. Every single person in that realm was raised by teenagers. They're all young parents or teen moms. Saying that's the curse and that obviously it sucks and that's why their numbers are dwindling is not good enough, because I cannot understand the stakes. I don't understand how this was sustainable for 500 years and it's not anymore. I don't understand the ways the world has changed in a way that has material impacts on the average person besides ""yeah they'll die early"". Some of this stuff was touched on, but not developed. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm reading it with other people who got the arc, and we're all missing something then.Okay, slight tangent, but it's clear that this world was not thought about at all. Because, naturally, I feel like there would be more inter-realm interaction if they were all weakened? The wildling realm could get their hearts from starlings who die early. Starling would not be much of a realm of its own, but instead be an orphaned diaspora at risk of fizzling out. Other realms would take advantage of their naivete and lack of mentorship. And so on and so forth.There was some bending over backwards to explain away magial heirs and create the stakes that if someone dies in the game, their realm dies. We don't find out until like 75% throughout the book that people begin to age when they have kids because of passing down magic and heirs and whatever. She mentions elders, but then what would an elder be? How old would they be? If someone can live to a thousand without having kids and still look like they're in their 20s, is that an elder? How long do people live after they have kids? I feel like naturally, that would disincentivize having kids which once again begs the question where tf are the wildlings getting their hearts? I read this book with someone who spent the majority of it convinced that [redacted] was Isla's father, which wouldn't have been possible if any of this was actually made clear. I also might have missed it, but maybe only the realm rulers live hella long. I doubt it though because it seems like everyone in this world connected to a realm has powers. The fact that I can't tell really just proves how convoluted the worldbuilding was. My confusion effectively killed the stakes for this book, and I could not find a foothold for the forthcoming tension. I could keep going for like five pages trying to talk about how the worldbuilding was thoughtless and an active detriment to the story. Also how it feels ACOTAResque. I did not want to live in the Lightlark world. I don't even want to visit. I don't have a good grasp on how much magic is in the world, how they lived so long with the curses, how many people live there, or even what it looks like. I was imagining traditional fantasy stuff until homegirl mentions a bra and then I was like hold the phone. Hairclips and scrunchies don't even exist in this world, and she's out here with a BRA?The main character, Isla, is insufferable, though I've read worse. Her entire thing is not having agency, but then she'll regularly let her emotions get the better of her and make the entire situation worse when she does make decisions. I did not care for her. I felt like a lot of internal character logic was warped for the sake of plot or love interest situations. Not a fan! It's somehow more frustrating than the miscommunication trope, and not in a good way! Small knit pick, but I hate how her name was pronounced Ice-lah. Like, if it's not gonna be pronounced like Isla, just spell it differently. Eisla. There. Fixed it!The love interests. I have nothing else to say other than Grim is Rhysand from ACOTAR and Oro is Prince Maxon from the Selection if he was OP and had hella magic. That perfectly encapsulates both how their written and the extent of their dynamics. It's so reminiscent of ~other stuff~ it's difficult to see them as their own established characters, especially Grim. They're both like 500 years old and have a rivalry.I don't know who finds the 500 year man and 18 year old girl romance appealing, but I'm so tired of it. It's laughable. Even if they look 20... seriously? Every time I remember the character's ages, and how they actually act in the book, I have to laugh. Even just the fact that she beats them both in combat. It's like... okay. Both of these men led their armies in a war against each other 500 years ago and have been practicing fighting since and they just got their asses beat by an 18 year old. She wasn't even doing anything new that they haven't seen or her puting her own spin on it. She just beat them. Funny. I know it's YA and the main character needs some quality that gives her worth like that, but it's just so jarring. Grim's dialogue is attrocious. I can't even tell if the other dialogue in the book is alright, or if it just looks fine next to whatever comes out of his mouth.Pacing of this thing was excruciating. It slows down a lot at the 30% mark, and doesn't pick up again until the 70% mark. Basically, the second act is a slog. Once you reach the midpoint, it feels like it should be the break into the third act, but it's not. A lot of this felt like filler. Aster could've combined scenes easily. The trials were boring to read, and felt like there were no real stakes or reasoning behind them. They were there to give structure to the book. I don't get why the centennial was pitched as a competitive game. All realms but one benefit from the curse being broken, so why would they all compete against each other so insularly? Realistically, yes, they would've competed but it would be more political intregue, alliances and whispering behind doors, and less of whatever this is... the Selection trying to be sold as the Hunger Games. Now, the plot twist. This thing has been teased up and down. The plot twist! The plot twist! Does the plot twist make sense? Tecnically, after like 10 minutes of explanation, yeah. Is it good? ... No. I thought the plot twist would make us re-examine a lot of the relationships that the entire book spent cultivating. It would add new insight. It did play with our perception, but it felt really out of left field. A good plot twist adds nuance. This. This was not that. This book was so entrenched deeply in plot and love interests that it lost track of like... theme. And now the things that happen in the plot are meant to inform theme. How the plot twist should reflect on theme. Maybe I'm the dumb one here, but I just thought the twist was cheap.In the hands of a more competent author, this could've been an intriguing high fantasy. Maybe it could've been written in multiple POVs and really intereacted with its characters as rulers of dying kingdoms, and the character motivations that go along with it. I want to see what Cleo's secret was! I wanted to see how Azul faced his fears! I wanted to see how the world's consequences and the rulers' motivations interacted and intersected and led to unlikely alliances and power plays. Or, at the very least I wanted to see some cool action scenes. Even within the context of what it is, as a female-led YA book, I would've wanted... something new. Something different. Something other than another sheltered girl who's really good at fighting and falling in love. Lean into the fantasy, lean into what makes this book different. Because it just feels the same. At least define the atmosphere to be unique or noteworthy, because for all that convoluted worldbuilding, nothing feels new.MINOR SPOILERS//I saved this paragraph for last because it has to do with the plot twist, so if you're avoiding spoilers, look away. I won't say exactly what the twist was, but I will say by the end of it, there are no morally good female characters in the book besides the MC and a servant girl who gets two lines. And when I say not morally good, I mean they're like straight up evil. Backstabbing betrayal. Any betrayal or misstep by a man is handled with miles more nuance and forgiveness than anything a woman does in this book. The women's motivations are cartoonishly handled, and in the end, the ones responsible for the MC's plight. Very, very boring. Very tiring. Their decisions don't even foil the MC. It doesn't inform theme. It's. I don't know. It's just... in 2022? Really? We're doing this? I'm gonna have to add more stipulations to the Bechdel test because come on.I don't want to write a conclusion, so I won't. Thanks for the arc. My curiosity has been quenched. Tiktok will love this book. I can't imagine that it's translation to film will be good. I say that as a film reviewer who doubles as an avid reader. Things aren't looking good.EDIT 8/15/2022Dropping it to one star for visibility and also because I thought more about the plot twist and realized none of the actual actions lined up with the convoluted motivations.Also, for people who are critical of Aster as an industry plant, I highly suggest you read more about her sister, Daniella Pierson, and how she made a creative agency focusing on tiktok marketing called Newsland along with her newsletter. Industry plants do not exist in publishing, but money and connections do lend privilege, which is nothing new. This kind of success has happened before. Ernest Cline had a movie deal for Ready Player One before the book was out. Then again, both RPO and Lightlark are highly commercialized novels, which I do consider an issue when regarding the industry as a whole and what becomes popular.I recommend Ursula Le Guin’s essay titled “A Matter of Trust” from the Wave in the Mind if you are a young writer aspiring to become better at the craft and feel tempted by the appeal of quick commercial success. I’ll put it in front of every tiktok and twitter author if I have to lol. Eat your vegetables (serious, challenging novels that challenge you to think). Reading for entertainment is fine, but your writing will become so much better if you understand what makes great books great in a deeper sense, which necessitates a balanced diet. Trope marketing also plays into the increasing commercialization of novels, which Aster has utilized heavily, despite many of her tiktoks being misleading. False advertisement is not good marketing, which is why we’re now seeing a backlash. But also writing a highly commercial book is not a good book, because tropes are tools and not substance. Sell substance to readers. Anyways it’s very clear to me that Aster cares about writing and storytelling, but perhaps not as much the art or craft of it. To quote Billy Joel, slow down you crazy child, you’re so ambitious for a juvenile.I am unfortunately a bit of an aspiring writer myself (derogatory) and do not find my work to be anything good, or special. But making peace with this inspires me to be better, to work harder. I can take it, and I’m sure Aster can too. I have no doubt that Aster has worked hard, but her insistence on publishing this book even after her first agent dropped her for it and her claim that she does not suffer from imposter’s syndrome despite her massive premature success does lead me to believe that her writing is stunted from a lack of introspection. That isn’t to say she shouldn’t be proud of her work or achievements, but this entire mess is just reflective of an author who got way ahead of herself. Books are not as good as their marketing, their tropes, or anything else of that sort. They’re as good as the author makes it. Brandon Sanderson said (roughly from his BYU lectures), don’t focus on writing a good book, but becoming the kind of author capable of writing a good book. Which is what Aster has been working on, but if Lightlark is any reflection of her progress, she has a ways to go.",1.0

A me sinceramente interessa poco di quanto le sue accanitissime lettrici cerchino di farla passare come una causalità, è talmente palese che mi sembra ridicolo negare l’evidenza. Il tutto è reso ancora più divertente dalle azioni persecutrici di Erin Doom nei confronti di chi OSA criticare questo ammasso di paroloni buttati insieme e dal suo passato (di cui sono tristemente a conoscenza) fatto di intimidazioni e minacce legali (perché ricordo che è laureata in giurisprudenza) rivolte a chi su Wattpad osava avere qualche elemento vagamente simile ai suoi nella propria storia. Imbarazzante. Velo pietoso. ————————————————————————edit #1: rating cambiato da tre stelle a una.1⭐️Questo libro é la prova palese di come le autrici italiane debbano ricevere un ordine restrittivo nei confronti del bully romance. Se non lo sapete scrivere, non scrivetelo. TW: menzione di abusi fisici e sessuali Non è il primo libro che leggo dell’autrice, e anzi ho addirittura seguito gli aggiornamenti capitolo per capitolo da quando su Wattpad esisteva solo la trama. La conclusione? Il libro che meritava di uscire in libreria era decisamente il primo, non questo. Questo, sembra un ammasso di scene discutibili scritte in modo troppo arzigogolato che punta a essere un retelling di cappuccetto rosso e che fallisce malamente. L’altro era un bel libro, per gli standard di Wattpad. Andiamo per ordine. I protagonisti:Abbiamo Nica, la classica santarellina amante di flora e fauna che giustifica il suo essere una totale inetta con il suo passato da bambina abusata in orfanotrofio. Se vi sembra che la mia descrizione sia insensibile é perché insensibile é il modo in cui questo libro mi ha fatto sentire. Gli abusi sui bambini vengono trattati frettolosamente, sono molto confusi e sembrano semplicemente un modo per dare una parvenza di sfondo alle personalità dei due protagonisti. (Ovviamente sono grumpy boy/sunshine girl, se non si fosse capito). Seguire il punto di vista di Nica é stato snervante perché si tratta di una bambina di cinque anni nel corpo di una diciassettenne. I suoi unici interessi sono i cerotti che ha alle dita, gli insetti nel giardino di casa e gli occhi neri del fratellastro.Poi abbiamo Rigel, un mezzo stalker ossessionato che grazie a due note sul pianoforte riesce a farsi adottare con Nica. Questo ragazzo si può descrivere semplicemente come uno psicopatico. Non c’é un altro modo per parlarne perché il suo unico pensiero é la protagonista e per il resto la sua testa é vuota. Il suo unico tratto distintivo é saper suonare il pianoforte e essere bono come la luna le stelle e il firmamento, ah e giustificare la sua psicosi con una malattia rarissima al cervello. Se questa follia vi suona famigliare é perché l’abbiamo ritrovata in “The Villain” della Shen, con Cillian che teneva a bada le emozioni per tenere a bada la tourette. (Evidentemente é una cosa che tra le scrittrici di NA va di moda? Non saprei.) I personaggi secondari: Sono in tutto sette. In ordine abbiamo, i genitori adottivi (inutili), due saffiche (inutili), la bitch della scuola (inutile), il terzo lato del triangolo che si rivela un abuser (inutile, perché ancora una volta gli abusi vengono usati come escamotage per mandare avanti il romance), l’amica dell’orfanotrofio che fa diventare il triangolo un quadrato (inutile ma accettabile, perché é l’unico personaggio che in questo libro si sopporta.) - Sui genitori non ho molto da dire, sono pressoché assenti e quando ci sono servono a fare battute tristi e a cucinare o vendere fiori. - La bitch della scuola, di cui ho totalmente rimosso il nome, c’è per due capitoli e serve a far suonare nella testa di Nica i campanelli d’allarme della gelosia. - Le uniche due amiche che Nica si fa sono due saffiche la cui storia viene buttata in mezzo al libro per circa due capitoli buoni e poi abbandonata. Una é innamorata ma non ha fatto coming out e l’altra non ha capito niente; purtroppo questa pseudo inclusivitá fa da contorno del contorno. Il tutto si risolve in pochissimi capitoli con nessun tipo di sensibilità sull’argomento. - L’amica dell’orfanotrofio, Adeline, è l’unico personaggio sopportabile. Il suo unico scopo é mettere un po’ di zizzania facendoci credere che sarà un problema tra i protagonisti ma per il resto é innocua. Oltre a questo serve a mandare minimamente avanti la trama rivelando finalmente che qualcuno dei bambini in orfanotrofio ha cantato sugli abusi. - Il ragazzo che prova ad abusare di Nica si chiama Leonard (o Leopold?), e devo dire che per quanto l’autrice abbia provato a farcelo detestare non é tanto peggio di Rigel. Anche lui la pedina, anche lui le fa cose che lei non ha chiesto. (vedi: il protagonista che le entra in camera e le fa dei succhiotti mentre dorme. é normale? no. mi interessa che sia il protagonista? NO.) L’ambientazione: É inutile. Questo libro é ambientato in Michigan ma la storia potrebbe anche svolgersi in pianura padana per la qualità delle descrizioni. Sappiamo che c’è un fiume (quale? boh), due case, una scuola e un ponte da cui i protagonisti cadono, FINE. Il che mi ha stupito, perché nel libro che Matilde (l’autrice usa uno pseudonimo) ha scritto prima, le descrizioni del Canada erano non male, seppur prolisse come al suo solito.Tra l’altro sembra una storia completamente fuori dal mondo. I personaggi si comportano come sociopatici e pur avendo due genitori adottivi che lavorano stabilmente ricevono come telefoni dei modelli con I TASTI? Evidentemente non bastavano le lucertole ma servivano i telefoni del paleolitico per far sembrare Nica ancora più piccola fiammiferaia. Niente sembra realistico, partendo dai pensieri dei protagonisti, passando alle ambientazioni, al modo in cui tutti i personaggi dialogano. (I dialoghi sono la parte peggiore, ma in generale lo stile di scrittura é cosí artificioso che viene da pensare che l’autrice si sia mangiata un libro di poesie discutibili e le abbia vomitate in prosa.) In generale? Questo libro non ha né capo né coda e mi viene da supporre che sia finita così perché l’autrice aveva un po’ troppe pretese che si sono risolte male. La trama é sconnessa e vuota fino agli ultimi capitoli (anche questi discutibili) il libro in sé voleva essere un po’ vago e misterioso, un po’ un bully romance in stile Penelope Douglas e un po’ rifarsi alle favole.SPOILER Il risultato é un mattone infinito senza una storia portante (ma prima di pubblicarlo lo ha letto un editor?) che si compone di episodi sconnessi e discutibili quali: il protagonista che la bullizza ammazzandole delle farfalle davanti e tirandole i codini a sette anni, il protagonista che picchia chi le parla, il protagonista che le fa i succhiotti mentre lei é ignara, il protagonista che le sussurra all’orecchio al buio da dietro, loro che entrano in bagno quando l’altro si sta facendo la doccia, loro che cadono da un burrone insieme e lui che sconfigge il coma (pur avendo una malattia cerebrale rarissima) perché lei andava lí a leggergli le favole. Il tutto condito con questi accenni agli abusi che i bambini ricevevano in orfanotrofio e che servono a questa storia come la maionese nell’insalata di riso. Onestamente rivorrei davvero il tempo che ci ho sprecato indietro.",1.0
501,Fairy Tale,Fantasy,"Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder. Because within the shed is a portal to another world—one whose denizens are in peril and whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe, where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the amusement of the “Fair One.” And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time. A story as old as myth, and as startling and iconic as the rest of King’s work, Fairy Tale is about an ordinary guy forced into the hero’s role by circumstance, and it is both spectacularly suspenseful and satisfying.","2 stars for a Stephen King book. Yeah, I know. This lackluster rating certainly hurts me more than it hurts King. Death, taxes and King’s storytelling skills are what are supposed to be life’s certainties, right? But — I knew I was in trouble when at 82% I was sure that I could put this book down and not care at all what happens in the end - even though I quite liked the first 1/3 of the story. And it’s not because this book is terrible - although King wrote a few real stinkers throughout his long prolific career, this isn’t quite one of them. It’s just that it left me not even as much bored as quite indifferent, and that’s a cardinal sin for a book.
 “Stories. An endless number of stories that pour into the funnel and come out in our world, barely changed.”
It feels like two books tacked together. The one I liked: a slice-of-life story about a teen boy who befriends a dying old man and his dog and sacrifices his last year of high school to become a caretaker. And the one that did not click with me: a story of a bland teen boy inheriting a passage to a version of fairyland where evil has taken a firm hold. The magic here fizzles out the moment magic world takes center stage.Conclusion: If you want to read a Stephen King book about a boy in a twisted version of Fairyland, read The Talisman instead. 
“In some ways those were good months. I felt useful, needed. I liked myself better than I had in a long time. Only the end was terrible.” If you are new to King, don’t start here. King’s forte is his supernaturally good storytelling skills and a great ear for dialogue, as well as his uncanny ability to take the most mundane things and make them both magical and unsettling. But what we get here instead is an adequate serviceable story that never rises above just that: a promising intro that leads into a fairly generic dark fantasy adventure of the Chosen One - Emerald City, commoners worshipping royalty, a lovely princess, undead henchmen and a Lovecraftian Big Baddie anticlimactically defeated. And no, it doesn’t turn into something better in the end. It does exactly what it says on a tin: it gives you a fairytale adventure, and not a shred more, and then just fizzles out. A lot of buildup and foreshadowing that led exactly nowhere, with no payoff and little below the surface. And the overall feel is that of a Young Adult novel that’s trying to be edgy.(Maybe I shouldn’t have been reading this in parallel with what I consider King’s best - the still amazing after a gagillion rereads It).It seems that King’s hook for readers this time is an adorable old dog. If you are a pet person, the one who’d seriously consider risking their life for the sake of a pet, he’s got your attention for a good chunk of this story. But, well, maybe the issue is that I’m more of a pet rock person, and that I need more than a lovely old dog to make me care.
 “Sure,’ Bertie said. ‘Monster dog. Like Cujo in that movie. Riii-ight.”



From a different author it would have been a decent effort, although still nothing special. But I know what King can do with books, and this makes Fairy Tale even more lackluster than it would have been had I been a newcomer to his ouvre. That’s one of the few times when those 600 pages actually felt much too long.2 stars. I’m still King’s Constant Reader and devoted fan, but this mediocre book is easily forgettable.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0
502,This is How You Lose the Time War,Science Fiction,"Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandant finds a letter. It reads: Burn before reading. Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, grows into something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.Except the discovery of their bond would mean death for each of them. There's still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win that war.","‘I want to be a context for you, and you for me.’There is something uniquely affecting when love is painted against the backdrop of the limitlessness of space and time. The effect has been done many times over but nothing can prepare you for the extraordinary beauty in which This is How You Lose the Time War allows you to experience love stretching out and weaving across time and dimensions to examine just how infinite it can possibly be. A spark of emotion that shines through galaxies reduced to dust, the countless rises and falls of mortal empires, the lifespans of all human feats and follies. Co-written by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, each writing one of the two protagonists, the novel is a soaring epistalatory sapphic romance between two rival time-traveling agents in a war between their respective societies to control and rewrite the multiverse in order to eradicate the other. Spawn by a private battlefield provocation, the two agents become caught in a maelstrom of self-discovery and romance corresponding by letters as they chase each other across time and space in a playful and imaginative novel so searingly beautiful the cosmos can barely contain it.These two authors have created something charmingly original in Time War, enhanced by the distinct dueling voices of the authors as their prose communicates and responds to each other along with their characters. Many of these letters, particularly in the novel’s latter half, blossom into pure ethereal poetry. On occasion it dips into purple prose, as one letter admits, however, what a clever sentiment for a profession of love between characters named Red and Blue to evolve into purple. The writing remains crisp, rotating between short narration and the correspondence between the two, allowing the narrative to progress as strongly on wings of emotion as it does the chain of events. What transpires is often intentionally vague as no time is wasted on much exposition or explanation, but fully immerses you in a world you won’t quite grasp or understand. It’s as if this gorgeous landscape of the multiverse were simply a blur as you are focused on the interaction between Red and Blue, much the way the world around you fades from focus in the first moments of love.Ultimately, any attempt at concreteness in a universe in a constant state of flux and revision would be beside the point, and the vagueness reflects that. It is only though the shared connection between Red and Blue that we can find a stable focal point as they pass through a kaleidoscope of time. Much like the way the pair gives context to one another, our only context is through them as well. They are each other’s only tether to stability in an unstable reality.‘When did it happen? Or has it always happened? Like your victory, love spreads back through time.’Entire multi-dimensions are shifted, burned or woven together on the battlefield of time between Garden, an organic and collectivist society from which Blue has grown, and Agency, a post-singularity mechanical society that created Red. They are locked in an eternal time-war of which the specifics and origins of are rarely addressed and even then are quite vague. The novel makes reference to Romeo and Juliet in narrative and thematically (the play, it is said, has different endings in each strand of time), and shares it’s notion of a long-standing feud where all existing players have forgotten why but continue to play it out to the point of extreme violence. What they are doing exactly is a bit elusive but strands are altered by, say, helping a city build a port or ensuring a mathematical formula survives the destruction of Atlantis: little things that add up over centuries to create wholly different versions of reality that are fought over.‘In the war they wage through time, what lasting advantage comes from murdering ghosts, who, with a slight shift of threads, will return to life or live different lives that never bright them to the executioner’s blade?...No death sticks but the one that matters.’ ‘What a microcosm we are of the war as a whole, you and I,’ Blue writes to Red early on, ‘An action and an equal and opposite reaction.’ The two women--they identify as she/her and can take on human form though you’d be hard pressed to form a definite image of what they look like based on the various hints--who’s designation as Red and Blue help to impress an idea as mere players in a game, are equals of one another, rivals ever, which is the initial attraction between the them. ‘They were separate, they did not speak, but each shaped the other, even as they were shaped in turn.’ What begins as a game of hunter and hunted in boasting and taunting letters quickly gives way to deep conversations about the self that makes them aware they have an agency beyond their respective Agencies and despite being weapons of war have a taste for the finer and beautiful things in life. In those moments they realize there is a hole inside them that only the other can fill. And as their love grows, they begin to wonder--partly due to the millenia of time they criss-cross during their budding attraction--if perhaps the love didn’t just arrive but had always been there. As with any sci-fi involving time travel, there is the inevitable paradox of events and free-will within a shifting reality and the two authors harness this paradox into their novel towards an exquisite and emotional end.‘There’s a kind of time travel in letters, isn’t there?’‘Letters are structures, not events,’ Red writes to Blue, ‘Yours give me a place to live inside.’ This beautiful refuge from war they’ve found in their secret correspondence also becomes a commentary on language and communication itself. In whimsical sci-fi nature, they write in abstract languages found in reading the structure of leaves on a plant or decoding rings on a tree (just let it happen, it’s super cool), which reflects the way the tools of writing shape how we write--a topic often written upon by philosopher Jacques Derrida. Their secret letters envelope the secrecy of their relationship and dangers they face even reading letters from the enemy, which is fascinating to think of considering a digital age where communication can occur through images (entire conversations can be had with emojis and memes) or other non-alphabetic communication. In our modern world we continue to embrace non-verbal communication that relationships can be built from, such as how with online dating many people exist only in messages to one another before meeting and form an attraction that way. It is a beautiful notion to consider how through just our words we can fall in love with the essence of another by showing an understanding, empathy and passion for the thoughts of each other (when I first met my partner we met in person only three times before she moved back to Ireland so for months we got to know each other through long late night texting and her sending me letters, so love across distance has always spoken to me pretty well). Messages written at one place in time, sent, and received in another transmitting emotions across time and space. ‘Books are letters in bottles,’ one letter reads, ‘cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.’ All books are love letters, if you think about it. One person sending out a message in hopes someone will understand and understand them in turn, an abstract connection that reaches even beyond the grave. There is a voyeuristic sense to this novel--reading their letters and all--but it reminds us of our primal instincts that desire connection and the fireworks of emotion that come from first contact with it. It is nearly impossible to not be swept up in their romance and feel their fears, pains, and needs standing naked and unafraid before one another, like a tree in winter unashamed of it’s gnarled limbs. ‘Love is what we have, against time and death, against all the powers ranged to crush us down.’There is a subtle shadow of dread cast across their saga keeping the reader keenly aware that their taboo relationship is always threatened by the larger world in which they exist. Agency traces Blue’s exploits and wishes to set a trap for her, one Red will be used to ensure the success of the mission. Betrayal exists in the peripheries of this novel at all times, especially when they begin to open up hoping this isn’t just some long con. Poison is an important theme throughout the novel, with the women taunting each other that any letter could be laced with it and choosing to read forward anyways. It reminds us of how we remove our armor and open ourselves up to pain when we choose to love. War begets death and suffering, and the two players have entered into this affair knowing the risks but plunging on ahead regardless. ‘I want to meet you in every place I have loved.’It is difficult to say much more without spoiling anything in this clever plotted novel. It is one that encourages an immediate reread, as clues and puzzle pieces are weaved into the novel much like the way our heroines weave space and time together for their purposes. It is an extraordinary little book that somehow manages to never feel like a gimmick despite it’s inventive and quirky nature. Time, place, love, and war all become a potent concoction for one of the most tender and vulnerable romances I’ve ever read. I could praise it all day long but, as is written in one of the cosmic letters, ‘I am the songbird running out of air, and I must breathe.’4.5/5‘I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together.’",5.0
503,Tress of the Emerald Sea,Fantasy,"The only life Tress has known on her island home in an emerald-green ocean has been a simple one, with the simple pleasures of collecting cups brought by sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend Charlie. But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death?","4.5/5 starsTress of the Emerald Sea was simply whimsical and wonderful. Starting the year 2023 with the first secret novel from The Year of Sanderson is the correct action for me.
“Even small actions have consequences. And while we can often choose our actions, we rarely get to choose our consequences.”
The time is here. The first of the four awaited secret project novels, Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson is here. If you're active in the fantasy community, or even if you're not, it is no longer news that Sanderson has shocked the world with the immense success of his four secret novels Kickstarter campaign. I mean, number one most pledged Kickstarter campaign of all time; it doesn’t get more successful than that. And it shouldn’t also come as a shock that I, as a longtime fan of his Cosmere novels, end up enjoying Tress of the Emerald Sea. I wanted to start my year with a great book, and choosing this book as the first novel of 2023 (as I said) was the right pick. Sanderson plus a full-length Cosmere novel is a formula that never ceases to impress me. What I did not expect, however, was just how visually beautiful Tress of the Emerald Sea would be. I am pleasantly surprised. I am glad the past Petrik decided to buy four premium hardcover editions of the secret novels, and I am eternally thankful to my co-blogger, TS, for covering the expense of the shipping fee. Without TS, I do not think I would cave into buying the premium hardcover editions, and I would regret it so much. I will go into more details on this later, but at $40 per secret novel (not counting the shipping fee) and for everything we get, this special edition can be considered, relatively, a bargain. This is on top of it being such a fun and cozy book to read.
“Leaving didn’t feel exciting. It felt heavy. Every child looked forward to the day when they could choose a different path from the one their parents were on. Tress sincerely hoped she hadn’t decided on one that led straight off a cliff.”
All her life on an island named The Rock in the emerald-green ocean, Tress lived a simple life with the simple pleasures of collecting cups received from sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend, Charlie. But when Charlie’s father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must leave her simple life to stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Although I expected to love this book, I was initially worried after reading the first few chapters. Note the word ship in the official premise. Sailing and seafaring dominated the majority of Tress of the Emerald Sea. Personally, I tend to have mixed feelings about fantasy books with a heavy focus on seafaring unless they're The Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb and The Tide Child trilogy by R.J. Barker. And there were indeed some sections here where I felt a bit of a lull because of this. However, my overall experience was fun. Most of the time, it was difficult for me to stay away from the book. Sanderson's prose and the relatively short length of the novel, plus its short chapters, made it easy for me to steal-read one or two chapters whenever I had some free time. This was a delightful book about human beings, contradictions, leadership, found family, stories, love, bravery, and empathy.
“It might seem that the person who can feel for others is doomed in life. Isn’t one person’s pain enough? Why must a person like Tress feel for two, or more? Yet I’ve found that the people who are the happiest are the ones who learn best how to feel. It takes practice, you know. Effort. And those who (late in life) have been feeling for two, three, or a thousand different people… well, turns out they’ve had a leg up on everyone else all along. Empathy is an emotional loss leader. It pays for itself eventually.”
Before reading Tress of the Emerald Sea, I did not read any of the secret novel preview chapters. However, based on the known artists and the title or premise of the four novels, Tress of the Emerald ranked third out of four. I am interested in all four, but I am most excited about the third and fourth secret novels. Based on these, the first two secret novels felt like they would be the most tonally different from Sanderson's other Cosmere books. Having read all published Cosmere stories, including this one, I can convey that Tress of the Emerald Sea has proved it. Sanderson has mentioned that The Princess Bride is one of the main inspirations behind this book. Another good comparison for what kind of tone you're getting here is Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman. So it is time to admit something. I haven't read or watched The Princess Bride yet, but I have watched Good Omens. And I think Sanderson nailed the comparison he's going for. The storytelling is whimsical and light-hearted in tone but also imbued with clever philosophical nuggets and serious themes occasionally. I loved the novel for it. I don't think I would've liked it this much if it was just all fun and joy all the way through. Sanderson's comedy, especially when the narrative involves young adult characters, doesn't land well with me often. But his hard-hitting and thought-provoking passages? That's another story. Sanderson may not have flowery prose, but the words he put on the pages of his novel frequently hit and became passages I think about daily. A few examples from this book are:
“While a healthy measure of foolhardiness drove our ancestors toward discovery, fear kept them alive. If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.”
And also these two long passages about memories.
“Beyond that, memories have a way of changing on us. Souring or sweetening over time— like a brew we drink, then recreate later by taste, only getting the ingredients mostly right. You can’t taste a memory without tainting it with who you have become. That inspires me. We each make our own lore, our own legends, every day. Our memories are our ballads, and if we tweak them a little with every performance… well, that’s all in the name of good drama.”

“Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again. Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing— like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure— we make of our memories the gods which judge our current lives. I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it’s at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We’re happy, sure, but were we more happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of our past… Do not let memory chase you. Take the advice of one who has dissected the beast, then rebuilt it with a more fearsome face— which I then used to charm a few extra coins out of an inebriated audience. Enjoy memories, yes, but don’t be a slave to who you wish you once had been. Those memories aren’t alive. You are.”
Although possible, it wouldn't feel organic to have these kinds of passages appearing throughout the book if the novel is told through the first-person or third-person perspective of Tress. These were effective because the entire story in Tress of the Emerald Sea is narrated through Hoid's perspective. Hoid is an integral character in Sanderson's Cosmere universe. And we, Cosmere fans, are all waiting for Hoid's origin story. Sanderson mentioned he wanted to practice and be more fluent at writing Hoid's perspective before that backstory novel happened, and this is the book where it came to fruition. This won't, however, be how the story is told eventually in Hoid's backstory novel. It will definitely be less whimsical. But to give you an idea of the kind of voice Sanderson is giving Hoid in this book, if you've read The Stormlight Archive series, this is more in tune with the unforgettable ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon"" stories Hoid told in the series. A full-length version of that kind of in-world story. I absolutely loved ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon,"" and obviously, I ended up loving Tress of the Emerald Sea as well.
“Worldbringers like myself spend decades combing through folk tales, legends, myths, histories, and drunken bar songs looking for the most unique stories. We hunt for bravery, cleverness, heroism. And we find no shortage of such virtues. Legends are silly with them. But the person who is willing to reconsider their assumptions? The hero who can sit down and reevaluate their life? Well, now that is a gemstone that truly glitters, friend.”
So yes, we get to learn more about Hoid and the Cosmere (more on this in the next paragraph) inside this book. But at the end of the day, even though this is told through Hoid's perspective, Tress of the Emerald Sea is still a standalone story about Tress and her adventures. I mentioned The Stormlight Archive earlier, and I am no stranger to voicing how much I love the Bridge Four group in the series. The found family trope is one of the many things Sanderson executed extremely well in The Stormlight Archive and the first Mistborn trilogy. And he managed to craft another cherishable found family in this book. Tress, Huck, Fort, Salay, and all the characters are well-written and likable characters. The Deaf character representation was written with the help of a special sensitivity reader to do it justice, too. And hey, for the first time in the Cosmere, we finally get to see a real dragon. As Tress and the crew of the ship she's in face danger constantly, the bonds between them grow deeper and deeper. My investment in them, too. And upon reaching the last page, I can't help but hope we will get more stories or appearances from these characters eventually. Knowing how connected with each other the Cosmere is now, I'm confident we will.
“She… didn’t need to do this all on her own. That shouldn’t have been such a revelation for her. But after spending ages walking around with everyone piling bricks in your arms, it can throw you off balance when someone removes a brick to carry for you.”
Speaking of Cosmere connections, and because people will ask me this question, should you read other Cosmere books first? Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story in the world of Lumar. This marks the first time we get a book taking place in this world in the Cosmere. Like always, it is not necessary to read the other Cosmere books first to enjoy the main story here. But will you benefit from reading them? Yes, you will. I talk about this already in my review of The Lost Metal. But moving forward, Sanderson's future publications in the Cosmere universe, especially the ones taking place after book 5 of The Stormlight Archive, will most likely have heavy Cosmere crossovers. If you intend to read all of Sanderson's Cosmere books, it is a good idea to start catching up reading them if you want to reap all the connections. As for this book, reading the entirety of The Mistborn Saga so far will be beneficial. Additionally, there were a few small nods to the magic or technology portrayed in Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Stormlight Archive. I will leave it to you to decide whether you want to read them first or not. There is no spoiler for these three series. Also, although not the primary planet of the magic and there is no main novel for it yet, aethers and its explosive potential are explored here.
“Now, most people would agree that humans are not telepathic. We can’t directly send our thoughts or emotions into the minds of others. Nevertheless, you can hear my story and imagine the things I describe—the same as I picture them in my own mind. What is that, if not a form of telepathy?”
One more thing before I end this review. I will update this once I have the physical copy, but right now, even the ebook of the premium edition alone is exquisitely made. Unless the paper quality of the physical copy sucks, which is so doubtful, I can vouch that the $40 I spent on getting this book is well spent. Maybe too well spent. It is almost ridiculous. You won’t get a premium/special edition like this with only $40 anywhere else. If Subterranean Press or Grim Oak Press publishes a book like this, I guarantee it will cost at least $200 (not counting the shipping fee and customs fee yet). The stunning design and the more than ten interior artworks (four fully colored art and the rest in green-toned black and white) by Howard Lyon enhanced the quality of the aesthetic and the tale. They are magnificent. And I am brimming with excitement waiting for the physical copy to arrive at my place. And if the first secret novel already reaches this level of production value, I want to read and find out what the other three will look like. Rest assured, in this review, I leave out some surprises in the clever design and artwork inside this book for you to find out for yourself.
“One of the great tragedies of life is knowing how many people in the world are made to soar, paint, sing, or steer— except they never get the chance to find out.”
Whether aesthetically or narrative-wise, Tress of the Emerald Sea provided a whimsical and wonderful reading experience. It is a refreshing addition to the Cosmere universe. And it is essentially (at least, it read like one) a Cosmere version of an adult fairy tale. With the success of the secret projects, some readers might think Sanderson favors quantity instead of quality in his books recently. It is up to you to think that way, but I can't voice the same sentiment. Personally speaking, Tress of the Emerald Sea doesn't show any drop in storytelling quality. Every book in the Cosmere, including this that he wrote in secret, works amazingly well for me. Similarly to the first Mistborn trilogy, even though this is undoubtedly a different kind of book, I think Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story that can be enjoyed by both YA or adult fantasy readers. Making this even more appealing to a bigger audience. This is a superb first book of 2023 for me, and I hope this signals the positive trajectory of my reading year. I look forward to receiving the physical copy and reading the next secret novel.
“The first is that heroes can be trained. Not by a government or a military, but by the people themselves. Heroes are the ones who have thought about what they’re going to do, and who have trained to do it. Heroism is often the seemingly spontaneous result of a lifetime of preparation… In the frenzied anarchy of destruction, loyalty to causes and kingdoms alike tends to fall to the chaos. But the bond between people, well, that’s stronger than steel. If you want to create heroes, don’t give them something to fight for. Give them someone to fight for.”

How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories is an illustrated novella following Cardan Greenbriar, during many different stages in his life, while we slowly see all the different things that shaped him cruelly. The sound that left me when I opened this book and realized we were going to get present day with Jude from Cardan’s POV… be still, my hopes and dreams and heart.Rovina Cai’s art is truly so beautiful that it renders me speechless. I was already in love with her and her art because of her work with 
The Wayward Children
 series, but this entire book feels like am immersive work of art. From the perfect color palette, to the most perfect details, she executes the vibe of Cardan and his story in a way that I don’t think another artist could.In this story, Cardan’s life is very much impacted by a troll named Aslong who was wronged by Cardan’s father. She tells a story about a boy with a heart of stone, who finds himself in a predicament with a monster girl who won’t scare him away, until his heart starts beating again. And then all throughout his life, she tells his alternate versions of this same story, each version with a new meaning for a new version of Cardan himself.


""She was the only real thing in a land of ghosts.""


We also get to see so much of Cardan’s perspective during 
The Cruel Prince
, much like we did with Tarryn in 
The Lost Sisters
, and it was everything. Nicasia and Locke have much wanted character development in this book, too, and I am literally on my knees begging for Holly to just give us the trilogy in Cardan’s complete point of view. But we see Nicasia being fostered on the land because her mother, Orlagh, Queen of the Undersea, wants to start putting pieces in motion. We get to see Locke, and his empty house and even emptier heart, teach Cardan the word “cruel” on every page. And these two, in addition to a prophecy looming over this young prince, are truly the first catalysts to this story and I was so in love seeing behind the scenes. And when Holly gives us Locke’s perspective one of these years…


""Playing the villain was the only thing he’d ever really excelled at.""


Each part, each mini story, we get to see Cardan questioning who he is and who he wants to be. Not to make this too deep, but Cardan very slowly realizes that he is not responsible for the terrible acts his family committed; both to him and to the people they ruled over. He struggles with his identity of a prince who should feel like he has everything, and a boy who feels like he has nothing. But seeing him finally understand that he deserves not only love but unconditional love? Him slowly appreciating that his heart can be warm and beat unapologetically? Truly some powerful stuff.On a personal note, I think most of you know that Holly Black is an author who means a lot to me. Her fae stories are what first got me into YA when I was young, and it really changed me as a reader and probably a human as well. I know most of you know that 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and everything, very much including my reading, so being able to curl up and read about my emotional support fae, from my emotional support author, just meant a lot to me. I truly think reading this book a day before release (bless you Waterstones and my mail person) was the best reading experience I’ve had all year, and for that alone this book was probably the easiest five star I’ve given in a year of not a lot of five star reads.


""Feels as though she has to earn the crown on her head over and over again.""


Overall, this felt like the fairytale of my dreams. Cardan is my favorite character in 
The Cruel Prince
 series (or any of Holly’s books, I think) and this truly was such a magical, wonderous, unforgettable addition to this world. I am incredibly biased over this series because so much of my heart and nostalgia are wrapped up within this world, but I honestly think there is just so much to love on every page of this book. I feel blessed to read about each time Holly gives us a new book, and this will for sure be a favorite of mine for all of 2020. Lastly, I cannot believe we really got to read about Cardan going out for boba.Content & Trigger Warnings: abandonment, bullying, abuse, mention of drug use, humiliation, talk of cheating, and a lot of drinking.

506,The Chalice of the Gods,Fantasy,"Percy Jackson, modern-day son of Poseidon, is just trying to get through high school. After saving the world multiple times by battling monsters, Titans, and giants, Percy is now settling in at Alternative High School in New York, where he hopes to finally have a normal senior year. Unfortunately, the gods aren’t quite done with him yet. Poseidon breaks the bad news that if Percy expects to get into New Rome University, he will have to fulfill three quests in order to earn the necessary three letters of recommendation from Mount Olympus. The first task is to help Ganymede, Zeus’s cupbearer, retrieve his golden goblet before it falls into the wrong hands. You see, one sip from it can turn a mortal into a god, and Zeus would not be pleased with that result. Can Percy and his friends Grover and Annabeth find the precious cup in time? And if they do, will they be able to resist its special power?Readers new to Percy Jackson universe and fans who have been awaiting this reunion for more than a decade will delight equally in this latest hilarious take on Greek mythology by the ""storyteller of the gods.""","""Sitting down is easy. Getting up, not so much.""The nostalgia is so sweet with this one. I've had a pretty tough week, and boy was it perfect timing to be able to go on an adventure with Percy Jackson again. He was my very first best friend, and the comfort I felt turning every page of this will not be forgotten. Even if it feels like Rick will never leave me alone, his words will always be something I pine after. He knows how to drive a story home!Every page of this felt like a throwback to a core memory we built together as a group of kids just wanting to go on an adventure. All of Percy's greatest hits lay before us so we could reminisce, and be reminded what it felt like to be a kid again. We're all grown up, and while Percy is still a teenager, he grew up with us, too. He's always had the sarcasm of his age and the courage to never actually act that way. With a Mom like Sally, how could he ever be anything but wise beyond his years? With Annabeth by his side, is it truly possible to be anything but special?He's never really been given a break to be a kid. Being a half blood doesn't allow you the luxury. I'm almost thankful for it after reading this book simply because he learned so much faster than anyone else that growing up is the most important thing you can do in your life. Loving people, getting to live life beside them, that's the point.Percy doesn't need anyone else to point that out for him, he knew it when the Gods gifted him immortality and he said no. But this book was a nice reminder that no matter what he does in his life, no matter how many monsters he must fight, the goal will always be to keep going with Annabeth and Grover. How sweet is that?How did he grow up so fast? How is he going to be a big brother (we knew that). How on earth is he smarter, more caring, more understanding that anyone has ever given him credit for? I love that even when he's fighting monsters, he still tries to give them the benefit of the doubt and a chance. That he deals with Gods thousands of years old, and will always give them a chance to change their ways even when they absolutely do not deserve it.He's a golden drachma if I've ever known one. I can't wait to see where his next search for a college letter will take him.",5.0
507,The Brothers Hawthorne,Mystery,"Two missions. One explosive read. Jennifer Lynn Barnes returns to the world of her #1 bestselling Inheritance Games trilogy, and the stakes have never been higher.    Grayson Hawthorne was raised as the heir apparent to his billionaire grandfather, taught from the cradle to put family first. Now the great Tobias Hawthorne is dead and his family disinherited, but some lessons linger. When Grayson’s half-sisters find themselves in trouble, he swoops in to do what he does best: take care of the problem—efficiently, effectively, mercilessly. And without getting bogged down in emotional entanglements.  Jameson Hawthorne is a risk-taker, a sensation-seeker, a player of games. When his mysterious father appears and asks for a favor, Jameson can’t resist the challenge. Now he must infiltrate London’s most exclusive underground gambling club, which caters to the rich, the powerful, and the aristocratic, and win an impossible game of greatest stakes. Luckily, Jameson Hawthorne lives for impossible.   Drawn into twisted games on opposite sides of the globe, Grayson and Jameson—with the help of their brothers and the girl who inherited their grandfather’s fortune—must dig deep to decide who they want to be and what each of them will sacrifice to win.","Was this my most anticipated read of the year?  Heck yes.   Was I disappointed?  Extremely. Before I start this review I just want to make it clear I love this series and characters so much. I still recommend the first three books in the series. They are so worth investing your time in. This one? Not so much. It started off really well. The four brothers together, talking and bonding. I was really entertained for the first 60-70 pages and then it went downhill. The  pacing is slow. Firstly let me start by saying  Nash and Xander  are really vital and core members of this series and the lack of them makes an immense impact. Nash and Xander both provide a sense of unity, balance, family and peace into Grayson and Jameson's chaos. I missed the two so much in this one. It was a terrible mistake on JLB's part to kick the two out of the book. Secondly, the  dynamic between Grayson, Avery and Jameson  completely fell. The three act like they no longer know each other. There are so few scenes of the three together it's just strange. Grayson and Jameson deserved more scenes together. They are no longer rivals stuck in a love triangle. Coming to the  ""love aspect"".  Those who haven't read the series yet, might want to skip past these few sentences.   Jameson and Avery were so amazing in the last book together. They had such good growth and Jameson was shining. Here, they had zero chemistry. Sure, they had like two good scenes together but the rest of the book they act like they are strangers? It is so weird. Grayson and Avery still have better chemistry. It hurts to see my man is still hung up on her. There clearly lies more in store for  Grayson.  His story is not complete and this was the sole reason for this book. But while doing so, am not sure what JLB was trying to achieve. He is broken. Hung up over so many girls who betrayed him so many times. He stood up to Eve towards the end and opened up to his brothers but his character needs more. There was no healing for him. Hopefully that gets rectified in the next book.  A major problem was the fact that JLB wrote the story in a very confusing manner.  We get Grayson and Jameson's POV. Both have missions of their own. Jameson's mission in particular served no major purpose. His character deserves better than that. Apart from two different missions, we get flashbacks in between which just makes things worse. The back and forth along with different pov started to make things unnecessarily complicated. No doubt JLB is a talented writer but she made a lot of mistakes in this. The way  this book has not much to offer and is written in such a boring manner makes it comes across as written purely for the purpose of money grab.  This book easily could have been a novella, 200 pages short but it dragged on in a miserable way. It surely reads like a novella but is a proper book. The only reason I will read the next book is for the fact am not ready to give up on Grayson yet. ~•~•~LET'S GOOOO. Justice for my bae~.~.~Justice for Grayson Hawthorne or I sue.",2.0
508,The Institute,Horror,"In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King's gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good versus evil in a world where the good guys don't always win.--front flap","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0
512,The Hobbit,Fantasy,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).","Some books are almost impossible to review. If a book is bad, how easily can we dwell on its flaws! But if the book is good, how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book? Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review, what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work? 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. There, see how simple that was? If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. At some level, there is little more to say. Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.But if it was only simple entertainment, I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book. Instead, this simple children's story resonates and fascinates. It teases and hints at something larger and grander, and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing, lecturing or being condescending.At its heart, the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in 'The Hobbit' when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told, but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof. How often has that idea fascinated me.Consider also how the story opens, with Bilbo's breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit, and Gandalf's continual meditation on the meaning of 'Good morning.’ How much insight is concealed within Gandalf's gentle humor! How often do we find ourselves, like Bilbo, saying something we don't really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning! How often do we find ourselves saying, ""I don't mean to be rude, but..."", when in fact we mean, ""I very much mean to be rude, and here it comes!"" If we did not mean to be rude, surely we wouldn't say what we say. Instead we mean, ""I'm going to be rude but I don't want you to think I'm someone who is normally rude..."", or ""I'm going to put myself forward, but I don't want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant..."", or even, ""I'm going to be rude, but I don't want to think of myself as someone who is rude, so I'm going to pretend I'm not being rude...""I think that is what makes this more than just a good book, but a great one. Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings, and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or self-loathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings. We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form, and we have for as long as we've had recorded literature. Our comic books are filled with those neo-pagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to, whatever else may be true of them, 'beats people up good'. These modern Ajaxs, Helens and Achilles dominate the box office, and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well. Oh sure, the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt, attract the opposite sex, and enforce their will upon others, but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility. How different is Tolkien's protagonist from Heracles, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman - short, small, mundane, and weak. Of all the principal characters of the story, he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute - martial prowess.And yet, he is not actually merely an 'average Joe'. Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles, it's just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isn't the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves. Bilbo is gentle. He is simple. He is humble. Power and wealth have little attraction for him. He is kind. He takes less than his share, and that that he takes he gives away. He is a peacemaker. Though wrongly imprisoned, he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him. Rather he apologizes for stealing food, and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took. Though mistreated, he harbors no enmity. He never puts himself forward, but he never shirks when others do. How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero, and yet how much better we would be if we did? How much better off would we be if we, like Thorin could declare in our hearts, ""There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."" How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things? What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to 'beat people up good'? What real use could we put it too? How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbo's virtues, rather than Achilles speed, strength, and skill with arms? How much less mature does this mere children's book of a well lit-world cause our darker fantasies to seem?Now, I admit I am biased in my review. I read this book 36 times before the age of 16. I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading. Yet in my defense I will say that I'm considered only a moderate fan of the book by many. I've known several devotees of the book who, like the protagonist of Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451', can recite whole chapters from memory - ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the world's technology if only the world's story tellers survived. If you are inclined to think no book can be that good, and that my review overhypes it, so much the better. Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded. Forget all I have said save that, ""If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable.""",5.0
513,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Fantasy,"It is the summer holidays and soon Harry Potter will be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is counting the days: there are new spells to be learnt, more Quidditch to be played, and Hogwarts castle to continue exploring. But Harry needs to be careful - there are unexpected dangers lurking...","(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:03/15/2020 - Preamble(1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga.""(2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts.03/16/2020 - 2%(1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three.(2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020 - 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020 - 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020 - 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020 - 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020 - 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020 - 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020 - 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020 - 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020 - 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020 - 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020 - 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020 - 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020 - 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020 - 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020 - 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020 - 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020 - 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020 - 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020 - 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020 - 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020 - 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020 - 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020 - 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020 - 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020 - 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020 - 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020 - 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020 - 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020 - 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020 - 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020 - 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020 - 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020 - 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0
514,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Fantasy,"It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster, he was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can't quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks' time?

I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.""- Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge.06/25/2020 - 6%(1) ""A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.""- How vampire-chic.- Snape's house could use a woman's touch.(2) ""In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.""- I guess she's always in her ""fury"" then.(3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows?06/26/2020 - 9%(1) ""Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.""- Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything.(2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is ""lionlike,"" Petunia has a ""horsey face,"" Vernon has ""piggy eyes,"" etc.06/27/2020 - 13%(1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities.(2) ""The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...""- Again with the animal descriptors.(3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever.06/28/2020 - 17%Harry and Ginny be like, ""I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.""(1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives?

Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose.(2) '""Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,"" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.'- I presume ""hooter"" means something different in British English.06/30/2020 - 23%(1) '""She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,"" Fleur mused.'- Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks.(2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible.07/01/2020 - 26%Ginny be like: ""Get a room you two.""(1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her.(2) Nearly Headless Nick: ""I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.""Ron: ""That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.""- Ron again with the common sense.07/02/2020 - 29%Finally!

Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny.- Not exactly subtle.07/03/2020 - 33%(1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it.(2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel.(3) Dumbledore: ""The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.""- Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians.07/04/2020 - 36%(1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious.(2) Harry: ""But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione?

She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess.07/09/2020 - 48%Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot.(1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ...

After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?""- It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying ""Won-Won.""

How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it!(2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :)07/16/2020 - 62%(1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.""- I vote Lavender.(2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.""- Pretty passive ambition there.07/17/2020 - 64%(1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?""Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?""Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.""- Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting.07/18/2020 - 68%(1) Lavender to Ron: ""Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?""- I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends.(2) Voldemort: ""You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.""Dumbledore: ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.""- That's some stealthy foreshadowing there.07/19/2020 - 71%(1) Ron: ""I love you, Hermione.""Hermione: ""Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.""Ron: ""I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.""- Essentially, that's what happened in the film.(2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense.(3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual.07/20/2020 - 73%(1) Ron: ""Quick, hide me!""Hermione: ""It isn't Lavender!""- If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse.(2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean.

No, wait, that was ""A Little Less Conversation.""(2) Harry's mind: ""She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!""- Ron, Ron, Ron.07/24/2020 - 85%(1) Ginny: ""All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ...

I'd guess that's be even more macho.(2) ""Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.""- Fight it! Angst was so Book 5.07/25/2020 - 86%(1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron?(2) ""Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.""- I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up?07/26/2020 - 87%(1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood!(2) Dumbldore: ""You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.""- So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic.07/27/2020 - 88%(1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining.(2) '""It's going to be all right, sir,"" Harry said over and over again ... ""Don't worry...""""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.""'- Hits me right in the feels.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

516,A Game of Thrones,Fantasy,"Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--and he did.In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is 'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and 'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's just written by women.Though I didn't save any choice examples, I did come across this quote from a later book:
""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""
Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters, 'they’re not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author: sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), but there's a reason we don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.I found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:
""I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... sure, he’s going to get into trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.
He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell 'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.Some say 'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin, Wolfe, Jordan, and Goodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this reviewThere seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms of racism.Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, he filled his shed with a bunch of notes (which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actually pre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just another cliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show.""My Fantasy Book Suggestions",1.0
517,The Fellowship of the Ring,Fantasy,"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.","Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's 
The Broken Sword
, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock’s 
Epic Pooh
 and Mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. He’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",3.0
518,A Court of Thorns and Roses,Fantasy,"When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature arrives to demand retribution. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren't spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.
The Writing
The title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to ""dance"" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.
The Worldbuilding
The Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.
The Characters
Faerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.
Conclusion
While I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",1.0
520,The Two Towers,Fantasy,"Begin your journey into Middle-earth.The inspiration for the upcoming original series on Prime Video, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.The Two Towers is the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.","4.5/5 stars

 “It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.” 

Friendship, hope, resilience, faith, justice, and bravery; these days, good-hearted with no grey morality characters are much easier for fantasy readers to dismiss. I totally get it; this type of characters and stories have been done more than a million times in fantasy stories, and readers—myself included—sometimes prefer more complexity. However, I also personally think that these kinds of characters are still much needed in the stories we devour. Maybe even more than ever. The Two Towers, being the second part of The Lord of the Rings, touches upon these themes by transporting its readers to an old and familiar ground, which I highly enjoyed reading.I’m genuinely surprised by how fast and immersed I am with reading The Two Towers. To be honest, I never expected to find myself compelled from reading most of Tolkien’s work, but I certainly did with this one. This is surprising to me because The Two Towers have often been mentioned as being even slower and tedious than The Fellowship of the Ring by several fans of the series. There’s something about The Two Towers that worked reasonably well with me. To be clear, there’s no clear beginning and ending with this volume, but that’s also why what the characters faced in The Two Towers resonated; they’re doing whatever they can with the hope that their faith towards one another will be rewarded. Many people in this world say and believe that true faith is achieved once you believe in something that you can’t see with your eyes. After what happened at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, the main characters are plagued with doubts on whether they can succeed in completing the journey they set out to do. And yet they persevere. Honestly, what they had was only the faith that everything will maybe turn out alright if they do everything they respectively can do the best.And isn’t that what we all do in our lives?

 “War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” 

I’m also, once again, amazed at the film’s portrayal of the Battle of Helm’s Deep. Now that I’ve read the scene in the original text for the first time, I will say that what the movie did on this sequence was so much more superior to what’s written. I’m not saying that Tolkien’s Battle of Helm’s Deep was poorly written, it’s just that the movie took the best quality of the text and increased the buildup, the tensions, and the execution of the battle dramatically. Picture: The Two Towers by Jonathan BurtonIf there’s one thing that the books do better, it would be the world-building and the characterizations for Faramir and Frodo. Frodo in the movies, in my opinion, was mediocre. I liked Frodo in the book more, and I think Tolkien’s writing of Frodo and Samwise Gamgee’s friendship was wonderfully done; it’s no wonder the movie could execute their friendship to its maximum potential. I’ve been saying this since I first watched the movies, and I will repeat it again that everyone needs a Samwise Gamgee in their life.

'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. ""I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?""''Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.''So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am.” 

As for the parts that didn’t work for me, I’m going to keep this brief by saying that every single scene revolving around Merry, Pippin, Treebeards, and the Ents bored me to oblivion. Thankfully, there aren’t too many of them, but wow they totally tested my patience; their scenes were as painfully slow as the Ent’s communication with each other.Picture: Fangorn Forest by Donato GiancolaOverall, though, despite a few issues, I definitely enjoyed reading The Two Towers more than reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Not going to lie, it helps a lot that there’s no Tom Bombadil’s nonsense here. I only have one more book left, once I’m done reading The Return of the King, it would mean that I’m finally done with Middle-Earth (I’ve read Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and the three Great Tales of Middle-Earth) after all these years.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.",4.0

And that is totally cool. I'm an academic, geeky type myself. Not as geeky as you. You are really geeky. Like I said: that's cool. Anywayz, for a long time I gave you two stars since a couple of my most favorite people (my brother and his fiancé) both love your book. One star for each of them. But, like I hinted, the book is pretty bad. So are you and me good? No hard feelings? Awesome. I don't take shit too personally, either. So now I'll get down to ripping your book, knowing we can still be friends.In the interest of full disclosure, I faithfully admit that this book goes in my DNF shelf. I made it 162 pages in (I was reading it on the Kindle app on my iPhone and made it to § 3154, but with little arithmetic I determined that was the equivalent of page 162 in the mass market paperback). I just couldn't finish it. I gave it a good honest try and eventually found myself reading only so I wouldn't have to admit to my brother that I didn't like it enough to finish. But that isn't a good reason to spend my time—something we have precious little of in our short lives—reading something I dislike and not getting paid for it. So I'm sorry, bro. I tried. (Yes, my brother is one of my GR friends and will likely see this review.) Now on to the reasons I couldn't finish the book.Most of The Name of the Wind is written in the first person; it's the autobiography of Kvothe, who has a number of things in common with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Kvothe is reciting his life story to a scribe while his male companion, Bast, looks on.FOOTNOTEThere are several interesting facts pertaining to Kvothe and Bast. First, Bast is described as ""sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes."" Second, Kvothe and Bast run a bed-and-breakfast. Third, Bast follows Kvothe around like a puppy dog. Fourth, Bast likes to tuck Kvothe into bed and watch him sleep. Fifth, Bast cries like a little girl when he hears something sad. Finally, Bast apparently can manifest himself as some sort of goat-man creature. Do you see where I'm going with this? Kvothe runs a bed-and-breakfast, in which a very sensitive and beautiful man follows him around and occasionally turns into a goat. Bed-and-breakfast and goat-men: what could be sexier? Not that there's anything wrong with that. I believe everyone should have the freedom be who they were born to be and I have several close friends who happen to be gay; I'm the last person who would have a problem with Kvothe and his beautiful male companion getting frisky (goat-style, of course). I only mention the implied homoerotic connection because Kvothe (a.k.a. The Most Interesting Man in the World) is supposed to be a lady-killer. No, not a psycho rapist murderer, you freaks. A lady-killa. A Lover of Women. I suppose that's not necessarily inconsistent; perhaps Kvothe swings both ways. Let's all say it together, now: not that there's anything wrong with that.END FOOTNOTENot all of the book, however, is written in the first-person. First-person narrative is reserved for Kvothe's recitation of his life story. The remainder of the book, particularly the scenes of Kvothe manhandling his lover in front of the scribe (Bast said Kvothe leaves bruises), are written in the third-person. I'll address my displeasure with the third-person sections first.Let me clarify at the outset that I have no problem with the writer switching between first-person and third-person narrative. I recognize it can be a powerful tool and it serves the structure of this story quite well. The book begins in the third-person, then as Kvothe tells his life story it switches to first-person, then back to third-person for occasional interludes. My problem is with the author switching his narrative voice within the third-person sections. The academic geek is all over the place in that regard. Sometimes he writes a scene in third-person subjective, other times third-person objective. Some passages read like third-person limited, others third-person omniscient. At points the author seemed to switch voice page to page, or even paragraph to paragraph. In one especially irritating scene he even threw in a hint of first-person for a paragraph or so. Maybe if I'd kept reading I would have found a scene or two in second-person, just for good measure. The switching of narrative voices was confusing and frustrating.Perhaps the author saw his story as being so epic and/or complex that a third-person omniscient narrator was called for throughout. I certainly understand the advantages of an omniscient narrator that can relate some scenes from one character's point of view and others from a second character's point of view, and so on. But that theory doesn't fit The Name of the Wind. With most of the book, indeed the real meat of the story, being written in the first-person, the third-person sections are a minority and seem almost incidental, merely setting the stage and creating some dynamic/juxtaposition. And the theory doesn't explain why some scenes are told from the points of view of everyone present (a voice that strikes me as pompous and unreal) while other scenes are described objectively, from nobody's point of view. Still other scenes alternate points of view paragraph by paragraph, or even sentence by sentence, and at a couple of points I wasn't entirely sure who's thoughts I was reading. Such constant switching without an obvious purpose or pattern made the omniscient narrator (if that's what was intended) seem unreliable.Now on to the bulk of the book: Kvothe's first-person account of his life story. Kvothe's account actually read much smoother than the third-person interludes. Without the worry of mixing up his voices, the author did a much better job on the first-person narrative. Indeed, Kvothe's story incorporates some fair (not horrible, not great) drama, suspense, and sentiment. Portions are even quite quotable. The Author was thoughtful and observant in his telling of Kvothe's story, relating events and thoughts with which I could identify and pointing out a few things I wouldn’t have thought of. Unfortunately, for the reasons set forth below, those good qualities were not sufficient to demand my continued attention.Many passages in Kvothe's story felt lazy, unnecessary, unintended, or unoriginal. A few things were just plain weird. For example:--> Kvothe asks his father a question and the father makes a big deal about wanting to answer with a poem, but after five lines he forgets the rest. Setting aside that the five remembered lines were some shitty poetry, why is the rest forgotten? If the poem was important, then the author should have taken the time (or sought the help) to craft something decent for the father to recite. If the poem was not important, why have the father recite a poem at all? A pointless poem only serves to clutter the prose. --> As a boy Kvothe watched his parents make out so he could learn kissing technique. That's weird.--> Speaking of Kvothe watching his parents, he has some sort of Oedipal affection for his mother. It shows in a few places but never more so than when he describes his mother as ""slender, fresh, and bright, pale and smooth-skinned in the firelight."" I have trouble reconciling the Oedipus Complex with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Unless I just misunderstand one or the other?2ND FOOTNOTEWhat I find especially interesting is my suspicion that the author was not consciously creating the Oedipal attraction. Similarly I suspect the author was not consciously creating the romantic connection between Kvothe and Bast. Maybe if I'd finished the book I would have found out that Kvothe was a gay man who masturbated to the memory of his mother. But I doubt it.END 2ND FOOTNOTE--> Kvothe declares that he will ""sum up"" a certain magical principle and begins with his ""first"" point. He then expounds upon that first point, but never reaches a second point, nor a third or fourth. The explanation merely peters out.--> Kvothe's father sets up a dichotomy between poetry and music that I don't believe exists. (I admit that's only a disagreement rather than a problem with the writing.)--> In several places there was a lack of creativity with turn of phrase. One passage uses the phrase ""there are times"" too many times.--> The author uses the definite article in a number of places were the indefinite article would have been more appropriate. In the passage I marked as an example, Kvothe talks about going ""deeper into the city"" without any prior mention of having entered any city, much less being on the verge of going deeper into it.--> In another place, a beautiful metaphor was ruined when the author spelled out his meaning explicitly. Some metaphors are more powerful if left implied, resting behind the words for the observant reader to find on his own. In this instance, it went from beautiful metaphor to so-so analogy.I also have a much more fundamental, underlying problem with the entire storyline. That is the quality of Kvothe as a character. He's portrayed as a superhuman hero with a towering intellect and dazzling physical prowess. Kvothe can do nothing wrong; no puzzle is too difficult and no problem too big to handle. He can thrive under any circumstance and no lady can resist his advances (neither can beautiful goat-men, for that matter). He wins over the most cynical skeptics and his knowledge of the arts and sciences is without equal. Kvothe advises kings and kills demons. He can even run a clean and comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Kvothe, himself, is his own story's deus ex machina. And that, to me, it is the ultimate expression of unimaginative writing. Supposedly Mr. Rothfuss wrote The Name of the Wind over the course of a decade or more. You'd think, with all that time to contemplate and mull over his book, he could come up with something more interesting than (ironically) ""The Most Interesting Man in the World.""",1.0
522,Six of Crows,Fantasy,Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price—and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can’t pull it off alone. . . .A convict with a thirst for revengeA sharpshooter who can’t walk away from a wagerA runaway with a privileged pastA spy known as the WraithA Heartrender using her magic to survive the slumsA thief with a gift for unlikely escapesSix dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. Kaz’s crew is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction—if they don’t kill each other first.,"Edit update or whatever I watched the Netflix show I'm on episode four and oh my god it's really good. It's really really fun and I can feel my brain leaking out of my ears whenever I see Inej and Kaz interact with each other. __________________________Five solid stars. This book pulled me in from the beginning, to the point where I knew I'd found a favorite before I was halfway through. Here, Bardugo integrates a creative plot, interesting and morally grey characters, group dynamics and banter, a great writing style, and some really, really prime romance plots. Goddamn, can Leigh Bardugo write romance. There are very, very few books that I love so wholeheartedly. This series truly is my favorite fantasy series of all time. There's no competition whatsoever. PLOTTING AND WORLDBUILDINGBardugo tosses you right into the main plot from the beginning and keeps you engaged all the way through, even when her focus is on character work. Her plotting is incredibly engaging, with so many twists and turns that the book is hard to put down. This book focuses on mind games and clever plotting. The dregs need to have a thousand backup plans, and everything is brilliantly planned by Bardugo. The Grisha's worldbuilding is very engaging, even though we're thrown in without context; I remember thinking that I would have appreciated a proper map of Ketterdam, and then we GOT a good map in book two! Bardugo's prose is awesome, and there are some truly gorgeous quotes from here. Then again, it doesn't feel as if she's trying too hard or using purple prose. CHARACTER WORK OF PERFECTION
A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.
Bardugo nails character work here. Every single character grows, every single character develops, every single character owns my heart. okay maybe not Matthias quite as much but w/eInej is a member of a gang and a murderer, but she desperately wants to do the right thing and liberate slaves like herself. She's gone through hell and she's come out strong and in control. She feels so real on page; she has a heart but she only lets it out around the people she cares about. I like that combination. Kaz is the most manipulative, terrible, morally black protagonist I've ever read about, and I love him to pieces. He's absolutely an antihero; yes, he's on a mission to save the world, but does he care about saving the world? Nope, he cares about getting his cash. He still manages to be a complex, dimensional character, who genuinely cares about his friends not dying (though he'd never admit it). Jesper is witty and an absolute delight to get a POV chapter from, but he's also incredibly sympathetic as a former farm boy who fell from grace. He likes living on the edge, and he's aware of the pain his own actions have caused him, and he's trying to work through it. Nina is hilarious and idealistic and clever and can go from flirting to making speeches within ten seconds. She's such a great character because she's so earnest and positive despite everything that's happened to her. She's also one of the most badass characters ever.  Wylan doesn't actually have pov chapters here, but he's getting a shoutout from me anyway because of his pov chapters in CK. He's entertaining here, too, coming off as a blushing do-gooder but with rumor and intrigue swirling around his actual past. Matthias is honestly my least favorite. He's dynamic enough and he's got a great character arc, but I don't feel as if he's nearly as original a character as my five. Whatever, I still like him. BANTER AND DOING CHARACTER DYNAMICS RIGHTThe Dregs are such an amazing squad all together. Their banter owns my heart. Jesper and Inej especially have one of my favorite friendship dynamics of all time; their banter and their genuine trust in each other and their lowkey joking about their mutual crush on Kaz. Inej and Nina stand out as well; extra credit for passing the bechdel test with flying colors. Also, the dialogue here absolutely rules. You have no idea how many times I had to hold in laughter. 
“When we get our money, you can burn kruge to keep you warm,” said Kaz. “Let’s go.”Jesper consulted his compass, and they turned south. “I’m going to pay someone to burn my kruge for me.”Kaz fell into step beside him. “Why don’t you pay someone else to pay someone to burn your kruge for you? That’s what the big players do.”“You know what the really big bosses do? They pay someone to pay someone to …”
HOW TO WRITE ROMANCE: A GUIDEBOOK BY LEIGH BARDUGOSeriously, I felt the need to give this an entire section of its own, because the romance here is SO good. But the romance plots never overtake the book; I have an annotations list for these books, and there are twice as many good character moments and gorgeous quotes as there are romantic moments. Kaz and Inej are one of my all-time favorite book couples. I used to consider them my third favorite, but they've quickly become my favorite of all time. They have so many small moments and such slow-build romantic development. And then, as if I weren't invested already, they have that one declaration scene which honestly made me swoon. 
I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.
Jesper and Wylan are just cute for most of the book. They got some cute relationship build, but I wasn't that invested. And then that One Line at the end of the book shows up and they KILLED me. Really, Bardugo? You could've left me heart intact instead, but?? not so much. Also, side note, but I don't understand how anyone was surprised they're a thing in book two. I know heteronormativity is a thing that exists, but how can you read ""not just girls"" and mutual blushing in a heterosexual way? Matthias and Nina were honestly not that big a ship for me here. I absolutely understand what's appealing about their dynamic; they're sweet and have amazing relationship development. But they don't appeal to me personally; I don't have to lie down for twenty minutes when I read their scenes. DIVERSITY: YOUR FAVE COULD NEVERSomething that gets ignored a lot is how diverse this series is; not just in terms of nonwhite characters, lgbt characters, and badass girl characters, although it does have all of those. But Six of Crows also has some of the best rep of a disabled character EVER. It helps that this is ownvoices disability rep. Kaz' disability affects his life in a realistic way, and there's no magical cure for it, BUT he's still a huge badass and the disability never becomes a consuming part of his character!! There's also the fact that a chubby main character is portrayed as the most beautiful member of the group, while also not being reduced to her appearance. There's even a dyslexic character (in FANTASY!) and part of his character arc is learning that his learning difference doesn't make him stupid. There's a major character with ADD as well. This series handles emotional and physical trauma in the best way. Some of these characters have trauma and it's never portrayed as a detriment to who they are as people. It's an aspect of who they are as people, but their background never takes over their characters. It's a balance. Recovery is also portrayed in a great way; none of these characters can be ""fixed"" but that's okay. The entire topic is handled in a better way than most contemporaries that focus entirely on trauma. I appreciate it so much. TL;DR: I was never bored by this book, and I love the characters more than my own life. Highly recommended.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | YoutubeA Bunch of Random Spoilery Notes / CryingUPDATE: I actually got my mother obsessed with my favorite book? in related news I still have to lie down for 40 hours whenever Kaz and Inej interact// three chapters into reading this with my mother and she says ""it's official: I'm in love with Kaz"" and honestly if that isn't the mood for today• remember when we all thought Wylan had gotten kicked out for banging his tutor? is it even canonically confirmed that he didn't? i need answers• I BRed a second reread of this (yes, I've read it three times, shut up) with Amy, whose review you should definitely check out!!• every single moment of banter is my favorite but my underrated fave is probably ""If I see a single scratch or nick on those, I'll spell 'forgive me' on your chest in bullet holes"" and the ensuing debate over whether 'I'm sorry' would be better• ""Close your eyes!"" ""You can't kiss me from down there, Wylan.""• or maybe it's ""my ghost won't associate with your ghost"" • every time Kaz and Inej interact I have to lie down for 40 hours• Jesper and Wylan are probably angstier in this book than book 2?• I don't even understand how it's possible not to love this book. With most of my faves, I love them, but I get it if you don't love them. I flat-out don't understand how anyone could not love this book. It's a masterpiece.",5.0

524,How to Solve Your Own Murder,Mystery,"For fans of Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, an enormously fun mystery about a woman who spends her entire life trying to prevent her foretold murder only to be proven right sixty years later, when she is found dead in her sprawling country estate... Now it's up to her great-niece to catch the killer. It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0

One hundred and twenty-two villagers and three scientists, living in peaceful harmony. The villagers are content to fish, farm and feast, to obey their nightly curfew, to do what they're told by the scientists.Until, to the horror of the islanders, one of their beloved scientists is found brutally stabbed to death.

If the murder isn't solved within 107 hours, the fog will smother the island—and everyone on it.But the security system has also wiped everyone's memories of exactly what happened the night before, which means that someone on the island is a murderer—and they don't even know it.And the clock is ticking.",Biggest disappointment of 2024 so far...Review starts at 6:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCAi...,2.0
526,The Great Divide,Historical Fiction,"An epic novel of the construction of the Panama Canal, casting light on the unsung people who lived, loved, and labored there.It is said that the canal will be the greatest feat of engineering in history. But first, it must be built. For Francisco, a local fisherman who resents the foreign powers clamoring for a slice of his country, nothing is more upsetting than the decision of his son, Omar, to work as a digger in the excavation zone. But for Omar, whose upbringing was quiet and lonely, this job offers a chance to finally find connection.Ada Bunting is a bold sixteen-year-old from Barbados who arrives in Panama as a stowaway alongside thousands of other West Indians seeking work. Alone and with no resources, she is determined to find a job that will earn enough money for her ailing sister’s surgery. When she sees a young man—Omar—who has collapsed after a grueling shift, she is the only one who rushes to his aid.John Oswald has dedicated his life to scientific research and has journeyed to Panama in single-minded pursuit of one goal: eliminating malaria. But now, his wife, Marian, has fallen ill herself, and when he witnesses Ada’s bravery and compassion, he hires her on the spot as a caregiver. This fateful decision sets in motion a sweeping tale of ambition, loyalty, and sacrifice. Searing and empathetic, The Great Divide explores the intersecting lives of activists, fishmongers, laborers, journalists, neighbors, doctors, and soothsayers—those rarely acknowledged by history even as they carved out its course.","I love stories that take me to foreign countries where I’m able to become immersed in different cultures.Panama is one such country.The history of the canal is fascinating. How America stormed in and offered Columbia $$ to give Panama its independence. It wasn’t a selfless gesture, however, America wanted a canal for their own economic needs.This is a story of those who came to help build, resist the build and those to reclaim what was rightfully theirs. There are those who travelled from across the country and from across the sea.As much as I loved the intent of this story and the characters, it fell short for me. Henriquez created such marvellous characters yet, she failed on developing any of them through. We have a young Ada who travelled from Barbados to get a job to pay for her sister’s surgery; Omar who was looking more from his life, takes a job working in the canal that mutes his father speechless as he is shamed by it; Valentina ready to lead the town to protest the dam required for the canal; and so many other fascinating characters.The story did merge beautifully yet I was still left wanting: More of some characters, less of others; more of the impacts of the canal.Overall a solid 4⭐️",4.0
527,James,Historical Fiction,"A brilliant, action-packed reimagining of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , both harrowing and ferociously funny, told from the enslaved Jim's point of view.When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond.While many narrative set pieces of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river’s banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin…), Jim’s agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.","Whoa, that was so not was I was expecting. Despite the Goodreads blurb that calls this book “ferociously funny” and “brimming with electrifying humor,” I didn't really find much to laugh about while reading it. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was just surprised by how serious and thought-provoking this novel ended up being. I mean, sure, there are a few funny bits here and there, but I definitely wouldn't consider this to be a humorous book overall.But, with that said, James is a brilliant piece of fiction and I have once again been wowed by Percival Everett's talent. (As an aside, if you want to read a truly funny book by Everett, grab yourself a copy of The Trees. It's amazing.) Everett manages to stay true to the tone and style of 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
 while at the same time creating something completely different with runaway slave Jim as the narrator.This is not an easy book to read … well, subject-wise, anyway. Lots of terrible things happen to good people, mostly just because of the color of their skin. There are awful characters who degrade and take advantage of Jim just because they can. There is murder and rape and violence and death. I've read books about slavery before, but somehow this one brought home the inhumanity of it like no other. I foresee lots of challenges to this book by the “slavery wasn't really all that bad,” red hat-wearing, book-burning crowd.I flew through this book and found it basically unputdownable. I read the first 80% in one sitting, forced myself to go to bed around 3 a.m., and then finished the last bit first thing the next morning. It's exciting and suspenseful and heart-wrenching all at the same time, and the ending was fantastic.If you enjoyed the original Huck Finn, you'll probably love this version at least as much, if not more. Percival Everett is an incredibly talented author and a national treasure, and this latest book of his deserves all of the praise and recognition that will undoubtedly come its way.Many thanks to NetGalley and Doubleday for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0

The Book Review Crew Blog
3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
531,The Princess of Las Vegas,Mystery,"A Princess Diana impersonator and her estranged sister find themselves drawn into a dangerous game of money and murder in this twisting tale of organized crime, cryptocurrency, and family secrets on the Las Vegas strip.Crissy Dowling has created a world that suits her perfectly. She passes her days by the pool in a private cabana, she splurges on ice cream but never gains an ounce, and each evening she transforms into a Princess, performing her musical cabaret inspired by the life of the late Diana Spencer. Some might find her strange or even delusional, an American speaking with a British accent, hair feathered into a style thirty years old, living and working in a casino that has become a dated trash heap. On top of that, Crissy’s daily diet of Adderall and Valium leaves her more than a little tipsy, her Senator boyfriend has gone back to his wife, and her entire career rests on resembling a dead woman. And yet, fans see her for the gifted chameleon she is, showering her with gifts, letters, and standing ovations night after night. But when Crissy’s sister, Betsy, arrives in town with a new boyfriend and a teenage daughter, and when Richie Morley, the owner of the Buckingham Palace Casino, is savagely murdered, Crissy’s carefully constructed kingdom comes crashing down all around her. A riveting tale of identity, obsession, fintech, and high-tech mobsters, The Princess of Las Vegas is an addictive, wildly original thriller from one of our most extraordinary storytellers.","This had a very strong start that quickly became bogged down by a dumb as a box of rocks MC, and an unrealistic foster child who is a brilliant child prodigy. The crypto currency and mobster side plots bored me to tears. The direction the book would take was telegraphed from the beginning: A Princess Di look-alike who has a residency in Las Vegas? A sister who looks just like her, who gets involved in a shady cryptocurrency deal? Predictable, but the ending was so convoluted my eyes glazed over. This was a buddy read with Marialyce, and sadly, not one we’d recommend.",2.0
533,The Other Side of Disappearing,Romance,"Ever since their reckless mother ran off with a boyfriend she’d known only a few months, Jess has been aware that he’s the same accomplished con man who was the subject of a wildly popular podcast, The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore. Now thirty-one, Jess didn’t bargain on Tegan eventually piecing together the connection for herself. But Tegan plans to do exactly what Jess has always feared—leave their safe, stable home to search for their mother—and she’ll be accompanied by the prying podcast host and her watchful, handsome producer, Adam Hawkins. Unwilling to let the sister she’s spent so much of her life protecting go it alone, Jess reluctantly joins them. Together, the four make their way across the country, unraveling the mystery of where the couple disappeared to and why. But soon Jess is discovering other things too. Like a renewed sense of vulnerability and curiosity, and a willingness to expand beyond the walls she’s so carefully built. And in Adam, she finds an unexpected connection she didn’t even know was missing, if only she can let go and let him in . . .","Kate Clayborn has done it again, composing a symphony by playing the strings of readers' devoted hearts. This heartwarming, genuine, and inspirational story delves into the lives of people who disappear from our lives, taking parts of us with them and leaving us feeling like half-empty shelves.The narrative beautifully explores realistic dysfunctional family dynamics, sisterhood, self-discovery, and healing wounds, all blended into a poignant love story. The unique and complex bond between sisters is particularly moving, bringing forth torrents of emotion that had me shedding tears.Let's meet hairstylist Jess Greene, who hides behind thick emotional barriers, having no intention of letting anyone in. She harbors secrets about her mother, who left her and her stepsister Tegan ten years ago when Jess was only 8. This event shattered her trust in people, forcing her to live like a shell of herself.

Tegan becomes enamored with Salem Durant, a popular podcaster whose show, ""The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore,"" becomes a viral sensation. Jess realizes that Salem is investigating the same conman who promised her a one-on-one interview that never materialized. The journey reveals that Tegan has been imitating Jess to join a road trip with Salem and his charismatic, giant, ex-NFL star journalist, Adam Hawkins, to follow the traces of their mother and her grifter boyfriend.Jess is startled by Tegan's betrayal but reluctantly agrees to join the road trip to protect her sister from the emotional crush she may have to face. Along the way, she slowly lets down her emotional barriers to allow Adam in. He demonstrates patience in earning her trust, revealing his own vulnerable parts and sharing his grief about a teammate who lost the battle against mental illness.The four of them traverse the country to unravel the mystery of the conman and his lover, the girls' mother. This journey becomes an inner exploration, forcing them to confront lost parts and fears that have prevented them from living their lives fully.Overall, this is an amazing self-exploration journey, a genuine sisterhood story, and a blossoming romance between Jess and Adam that warms the heart. Adam, with his cinnamon bun demeanor disguised under a giant facade, possesses all the qualities of the best book boyfriend. I recommend this book to anyone seeking something inspirational, soul-healing, and positive to lighten their mood.Many thanks to NetGalley and Kensington Books for sharing this lovely book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

The characters were likeable and the focus was on women, the roles others wanted for them, what the women wanted for themselves, and the challenges they faced in achieving them. Other themes included friendship, family, life choices, wartime danger, community, found family, sacrifice, volunteerism, treatment of others, the power of books, hope, and romance.Overall, I learned a lot about these women who had a vision and pursued it relentlessly as well as about the library itself and the internment camps on the Isle of Man.

535,The Morningside,Fiction,"From the critically beloved, New York Times bestselling author of The Tiger's Wife and Inland, a magical novel of mothers and daughters, displacement and belonging, and myths both old and new.There’s the world you can see. And then there’s the one you can’t. Welcome to the Morningside.After being expelled from their ancestral home, Silvia and her mother finally settle at the Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family's past. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she know why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia's lonely and impoverished reality.Enchanted by Ena’s stories, Silvia begins seeing the world with magical possibilities and becomes obsessed with the mysterious older woman who lives in the penthouse of the Morningside. Bezi Duras is an enigma to everyone in the building. She has her own elevator entrance and leaves only to go out at night and walk her three massive hounds, often not returning until the early morning. Silvia’s mission to unravel the truth about this woman’s life, and her own haunted past, may end up costing her everything.Startling, inventive, and profoundly moving, The Morningside is a novel about the stories we tell—and the stories we refuse to tell—to make sense of where we came from and who we hope we might become.","The Morningside by Téa Obreht is a Family and Literary Fiction Story Sprinkled With Magical Realism and Set in a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic World! 
Holy-Moly! There's a lot going on in this story...
Silvia knows little about where she's from, why they had to leave, or why her mother keeps their past so secretive. The only thing she knows is now they're living at The Morningside, an aging luxury high-rise in Island City where her Aunt Ena has lived and worked for the past ten years.  Silvia loves her conversations with Aunt Ena, who feeds her imagination with stories about the homeland she doesn't remember. Silvia becomes enamored by Ena's tales and her imagination spills over with thoughts about the mysterious resident living in the penthouse. She makes it her focus to discover the truth about this woman's life... The Morningside is a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic story written in the first-person narrative of curious eleven-year-old Silvia. Silvia is quiet, bright, and observant and possesses keen senses for a child her age. Perhaps it's due to being raised by a mother who shares little that Silvia is driven to find answers on her own. Silvia meets two individuals she develops friendships with and it's through these connections the story becomes more about the characters and relationships and less about the changing world described in Obreht's lovely writing. The story can feel cramped with melodrama and distractions, jumping from one catastrophe to the next, and taking abrupt turns through unexpected decisions by the characters. For me, it added additional layers and interest.The Morningside is creative and original storytelling about a mother-daughter relationship, finding family, and discovering your place in the world. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a well-written character-driven Family and Literary Fiction story with touches of Magical Realism like I do. I plan to look at Téa Obreht's backlist for more to read while I wait for her next book!4⭐Thank you to Random House and Téa Obreht for a physical ARC, and a DRC of this book through NetGalley.

Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion.

537,If the Tide Turns,Historical Fiction,"1715, Eastham, Massachusetts: As the daughter of a wealthy family, Maria Brown has a secure future mapped out for her, yet it is not the future she wants.

As for what Maria does want—only one person has ever even asked her that question.Samuel Bellamy, an orphaned sailor searching for work, meets Maria by chance, enthralling her with talk of far-flung places and blasphemous ideals.

Maria's determined to wait for Sam, but her parents are putting pressure on her to marry, Sam thinks she’s waiting for him and Maria is getting desperate in Eastham, Massachusetts. I received a copy of If the Tide Turns by Rachel Rueckert from Kensington Publishing and Edelweiss Plus in exchange for an honest review. The well written debut novel is told from the points of view of Maria and Sam and inspired by a real-life pirate Sam Bellamy. The reader's given an idea of what piracy was really like in the early 1700's, life in Colonial America, use of herbal medicine, banishment of women, evils of slavery and the plight of the Native American Wampanoag people.

538,Becoming Madam Secretary,Historical Fiction,"Raised on tales of her revolutionary ancestors, Frances Perkins arrives in New York City at the turn of the century, armed with her trusty parasol and an unyielding determination to make a difference.When she’s not working with children in the crowded tenements in Hell’s Kitchen, Frances throws herself into the social scene in Greenwich Village, befriending an eclectic group of politicians, artists, and activists, including the millionaire socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, the flirtatious budding author Sinclair Lewis, and the brilliant but troubled reformer Paul Wilson, with whom she falls deeply in love.But when Frances meets a young lawyer named Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a tea dance, sparks fly in all the wrong directions. She thinks he’s a rich, arrogant dilettante who gets by on a handsome face and a famous name. He thinks she’s a priggish bluestocking and insufferable do-gooder. Neither knows it yet, but over the next twenty years, they will form a historic partnership that will carry them both to the White House.Frances is destined to rise in a political world dominated by men, facing down the Great Depression as FDR’s most trusted lieutenant—even as she struggles to balance the demands of a public career with marriage and motherhood. And when vicious political attacks mount and personal tragedies threaten to derail her ambitions, she must decide what she’s willing to do—and what she’s willing to sacrifice—to save a nation.","**Many thanks to Berkley and Stephanie Dray for an ARC of this book provided via NetGalley!**""Being a woman has only bothered me in climbing trees."" - Frances PerkinsIt is this frank and fearless nature that sets Frances Perkins apart...and from the moment she arrives in New York City, destined to bring about change, she truly has her work cut out for her. Working with some of the poorest in Hell's Kitchen's tenements, it is apparent that working conditions (and living conditions) are not sustainable for the people of her fair city. She has several compatriots, each with a fire for revolution in their bellies: there's Upton Sinclair, a cheeky young fire-haired writer who longs to be more than just friends with Frances, a wealthy but kind socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, and a brooding, sensitive young reformer Paul Wilson, each determined to change the landscape in their own way. But after witnessing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire firsthand (with workers literally LEAPING out of the burning building to the ground below), Frances knows that labor conditions need change: immediate and DRASTIC change. Though she isn't directly involved in politics herself, Frances gets word that Franklin ""Feather Duster"" Roosevelt, a rich and haughty man she encountered at a party once (who wasn't exactly her number one fan, to put it mildly!) is running for office...and he might actually WIN. Roosevelt has a plan that will take him up through the ranks, and quickly: a plan that will end with him in the White House. When all of this comes to pass, NO one is more surprised than Frances when FDR not only recognizes Frances' passion for reform and labor policy, but wants to appoint her to be his Secretary of Labor...making her the very FIRST woman in the presidential cabinet.Although Frances is honored and perhaps more passionate and driven by her work than anyone around her, she is met with push-back and criticism over and over again. Many men assume she can't do her job AND be a wife and mother...but Frances isn't going to let anything stand in her way. But balancing the severe troubles experienced by members of her family...acting as an indomitable force during FDR's tenure...AND fighting for social security and labor reform proves to be nearly overwhelming for Frances, and she starts to wonder if she can TRULY make all of these dreams come true. Will her bold determination start a blaze of glory that will continue on for generations to come...or will everything she has worked for crumble before her very eyes?I'm a bit ashamed to say that before picking up this book, I probably hadn't heard the name Frances Perkins since elementary school...and since this may have been back in the 2nd or 3rd grade I couldn't have told you a THING about her. After reading this book, it's not only shocking but saddening to me that such an integral part of history was not a MAJOR focus in the curriculum. As someone who is very passionate when it comes to workers' rights (and as a former Union member myself, when I had the opportunity to be in one!) it was easy for me to become VERY invested in Frances' mission as she fought to keep children out of factories, to enforce more limited working hours (No more fourteen hour days...and we think we have it bad now! ) and to establish programs like social security which would benefit ALL citizens, not just those born into wealth. Sadly, many of these fights persist today, but they would have been Dead on Arrival PERMANENTLY if not for the tireless work of Frances Perkins. To say this book is enlightening is an understatement: I feel I owe Frances a debt of gratitude!Dray also does something special with this narrative: this is technically historical fiction, but almost reads more like a diary or a memoir. Perkins takes you through so many years of her life, but the chapters are fairly short and manageable, and there is a solid balance between Perkins' work life and her personal life. There is romance and heartache, inner turmoil and also an exploration of the power of friendship. While Perkins and FDR have a rocky start, the two learn to work in tandem in a truly powerful way, and like all of the relationships explored here, has a complexity and a beauty all its own. Perkins' choices are never easy, and this is the recurring theme underlying her entire career. Being a woman during this time was hard enough in and of itself, but to make some of the 'radical' statements and decisions Perkins was forced to make at times was what set her apart...and I am SO thrilled Dray chose to share this history in such an interesting way.This book is also 500+ pages (!) which is usually somewhat of a red flag for me when it comes to historical fiction, but this one is written in such a way that it never feels overly long or complex. The chapters move along at a pretty good clip, and as a reader I felt that the only reason the book was this length was to make sure she captured as much detail about Perkins' life as possible: this one is meticulously researched, with Dray highlighting at the end any areas where she took creative liberty, but these are few and far between. There's always a stark difference between authors who TRULY do their research in historical fiction and those that rely on more 'basic' tropes and commonly known information. I applaud Dray's dedication to preserving the integrity of Frances Perkins and EVERYTHING she accomplished during her truly impactful time in office.And through Dray, by the end of her journey, Perkins makes an observation true of so many bold and brilliant, brave and breathtaking revolutionaries of the past, present, and future: ""So maybe a spark of madness is what it takes to accomplish anything truly revolutionary in this world.""One tiny, seemingly insignificant, but POWERFUL spark! 🔥 💪4 stars",4.0

I can protect Mrs. Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It's simply a question of how far I'm willing to go...","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

”in every universe, it’s you for me. even if it’s not me for you.”

— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift. can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life! did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called “happy place” i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make you happy. the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm! — this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between a past and present timeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.

”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”

 — second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.— PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending. ↳ harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace, the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough* i also hate my job. her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.↳ wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters. ↳ 
wyn and harriet:
— i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. — i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹

“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”

↳ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was that friendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>> — overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!! — but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happy happy place release day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.",4.0
541,The Inmate,Thriller,"There are three rules Brooke Sullivan must follow as a new nurse practitioner at a men's maximum-security 1) Treat all prisoners with respect. 2) Never reveal any personal information. 3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates. But none of the staff at the prison knows Brooke has already broken the rules. Nobody knows about her intimate connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary's most notorious and dangerous inmates. And they certainly don't know that Shane was Brooke's high school sweetheart―the star quarterback who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of grisly murders. Or that Brooke's testimony was what put him there. But Shane knows. And he will never forget.","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0
542,Lessons in Chemistry,Fiction,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD WINNER • Meet Elizabeth Zott: a “formidable, unapologetic and inspiring” (PARADE) scientist in 1960s California whose career takes a detour when she becomes the unlikely star of a beloved TV cooking show in this novel that is “irresistible, satisfying and full of fuel” (The New York Times Book Review) and “witty, sometimes hilarious . . . the Catch-22 of early feminism.” (Stephen King, via Twitter)A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, Oprah Daily, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek“The most delightful novel I read this year . . . fresh and surprising . . . I laughed out loud!” —Philip Galanes, The New York Times“A unique heroine . . . you’ll find yourself wishing she wasn’t fictional.” —Seattle TimesChemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results. But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six. Elizabeth’s unusual approach to cooking (“combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride”) proves revolutionary. But as her following grows, not everyone is happy. Because as it turns out, Elizabeth Zott isn’t just teaching women to cook. She’s daring them to change the status quo. Laugh-out-loud funny, shrewdly observant, and studded with a dazzling cast of supporting characters, Lessons in Chemistry is as original and vibrant as its protagonist.","(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)[plot spoilers]I had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.So this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.This all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!So this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!But there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.I'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.P.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!",2.0
543,The Midnight Library,Fiction,"Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————

Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.",1.0
545,Yellowface,Fiction,"Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel. Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do. yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn't work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way. my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc. this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way. so many mouthpieces. i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing as framing and context which are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie, when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary. despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrative is juniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was, ‘…that’s it?’ i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says, ‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’ Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface. it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere. oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:  ""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""  but what happens after? we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we've seen the cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that it teases you with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assault edit 24/05/2023:  unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1) i am not white. i am asian,  2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired. in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about. 'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.' go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry. and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.",2.0
546,Remarkably Bright Creatures,Fiction,"After Tova Sullivan's husband died, she began working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium, mopping floors and tidying up. Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she's been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago.Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn't dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors--until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova.Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova's son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it's too late.Shelby Van Pelt's debut novel is a gentle reminder that sometimes taking a hard look at the past can help uncover a future that once felt impossible.","This might be my favorite book this year, and will also be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Why did I love it so much? Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style. Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus? The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.",5.0
547,One by One,Thriller,"One by one, they will get what they deserve...A night spent sleeping on dirt and leaves is not how Claire Matchett expected to spend her vacation.She thought this would be a break from the stresses of work and raising her young children. A chance to repair her damaged marriage. A week of hiking and hot tubs with two other couple friends. It sounded like heaven.Then Claire’s minivan breaks down on a lonely dirt road. With no cell reception, the group has no choice but to hike the rest of the way to their hotel. But it turns out the woods aren’t as easy to navigate as they thought.Hours later, they are lost. Hopelessly lost. And as they navigate deeper into the woods, the members of their party are struck down mysteriously one by one. Has a wild animal been hunting them? Or is the hunter one of them?But as more time passes, one thing becomes clear:Only one of them will return home alive.","I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",3.0

The series adaptation on Prime Video just released and it’s so far freaking good, especially the songs ! And here’s my review for this legendary novel of TJR! Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a captivating and emotional story that explores the rise and fall of a fictional 1970s rock band named The Six, as told through the eyes of their lead singer, Daisy Jones.The novel is written in an unconventional format, presented as a transcript of interviews with the band members, their friends, and family, as well as other individuals who were involved in the band's journey. This format is not only unique but also adds a sense of realism to the story, making the reader feel as though they are reading a true account of a band's rise to fame. The characters in Daisy and the Six are incredibly well-developed, with each member of the band having their own distinct personality and backstory. Daisy, in particular, is a compelling character, with her raw talent and rebellious spirit causing both admiration and friction among her bandmates. The novel's portrayal of the music industry in the 1970s is also fascinating, with the reader getting a glimpse into the excess and indulgence that came with fame during that era. The book's exploration of the band's creative process is also intriguing, as it delves into the complexities of writing and performing music.One of the strengths of Daisy and the Six is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader. The highs and lows of the band's journey are felt keenly, and the relationships between the characters are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.What makes Daisy and the Six such a compelling read is the way that Taylor Jenkins Reid captures the spirit of the 1970s music scene. The story is set against a backdrop of social and cultural change, and the author weaves these themes seamlessly into the narrative.The book is a love letter to rock and roll, and Jenkins Reid's passion for music shines through in every chapter. She expertly captures the excitement and energy of live performances, and the way that music can bring people together.But beyond the music, Daisy and the Six is also a deeply human story about love, loss, and the bonds that connect us. The relationships between the band members are complex and multifaceted, and the novel delves into the various conflicts and tensions that arise as a result.What's more, the book is also a commentary on the nature of fame and the toll that it can take on those who achieve it. The Six are catapulted to stardom almost overnight, and the pressure to maintain their success takes a heavy toll on the band members' personal lives.In conclusion, Daisy and the Six is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that will stay with readers long after they finish it. It's a must-read for anyone who loves music, drama, and unforgettable characters, and it's a testament to the enduring power of rock and roll.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
549,Listen for the Lie,Mystery,"Lucy and Savvy were the golden girls of their small Texas town: pretty, smart, and enviable. Lucy married a dream guy with a big ring and an even bigger new home. Savvy was the social butterfly loved by all, and if you believe the rumors, especially popular with the men in town. It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life.But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast ""Listen for the Lie,"" and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
550,The Guest List,Mystery,"A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times bestselling author of The Hunting Party.The bride – The plus one – The best man – The wedding planner – The bridesmaid – The bodyOn an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It’s a wedding for a magazine, or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride’s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn’t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why?","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot.

551,"Good Girl, Bad Blood",Mystery,"Pip is not a detective anymore.With the help of Ravi Singh, she released a true-crime podcast about the murder case they solved together last year. The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
552,Ward D,Thriller,"Amy has been dreading her evening working on Ward D, the hospital’s inpatient mental health unit. There are very specific reasons why she never wanted to do this required overnight rotation. Reasons nobody can ever find out.And as the hours tick by, Amy grows increasingly convinced something terrible is happening within these tightly secured walls. When patients and staff start to vanish without a trace, it becomes clear that everyone on the unit is in grave danger.Amy’s worst nightmare was spending the night on Ward D.And now she might never escape.","After many comments on my review I’m changing it. I didn’t like the book, the main character was extremely unlikeable and I kept rolling my eyes when reading what she thought and did. The plot was unlikely and sometimes hilariously so, like watching a very bad horror movie. And I know many feel (as do I) that the mental health representation was quite bad. I’ve heard McFadden changed the number of times she wrote ‘crazy’ as there was an overwhelming number of it.",2.0

555,To Kill a Mockingbird,Classics,"The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.","/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.",1.0
556,The Great Gatsby,Classics,"Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted ""gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,"" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.(from the back cover)","Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life”, focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. 

Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¹ - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¹ I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.
Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
“voice is full of money”
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.

The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
“an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again”
.

This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? 

Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose voices are “full of money”, who are “gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor”, people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”



This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me now, almost a full century since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you.

557,Animal Farm,Classics,"Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.","سيظل دائما جميع الحيوانات سواسية..الا ان بعض ""الخنازير"" ستري دائما انها ""متساوية"" اكثر من الاخرينجورج اورويل عام 1943 يقدم لنا نموذج لثورةثورة حيوانات علي ""صاحب العزبة""..عشان حقوقهمثورة زي اي ثورة في تاريخ الانسانية..ثورة زي الثورة الروسية ولا الرومانية ولا ....أهي ثورةحكاية مكررة، تقريبا بنفس النهاية..فإننا لم نتعلم من التاريخ، فهل سنتعلم من الرمز؟الحكاية هنا حكاية ثورةثورة ما من اجل عيش يتناسب مع العمل..من اجل حرية حقيقيةثورة ما من اجل الكرامة..ثورة من اجل العدالة الاجتماعيةثورة نجحت في ازالة الضاغية...ثورة نجحت في جعل الارض كلها حقا للثوارصارت ارضهم وملكهم..صار خيرها كله لهم..صاروا يملكون زمام امورهمصاروا يتغنون نشيد نصرهم...فرحين بحريتهم..يرون في المستقبل فقط رخائهمآل التنظيم الي جماعه من الخنازير..يقودها اثنانالاول اختار مصلحة باقي الحيوانات واراد تطوير حياتهم بما يحقق اهداف ثورتهموالثاني اختار الكسل..اختار التراخياختار ان يطلق علي الاول كلابه ليتلاشيواختار ان ينفيه ويعلنه خائنا للبلاد..لاختلاف سياسة الاصلاح التي يريدها الاول بسياستهشوه سمعته ومحا بطولته..بإستخدام خنزير اعلامي ""يقلب الحق باطلا"" ايضا يعمل تحت سياستهاختار ان يغير الدستور الوصايا السبع..بما يحقق مصالحه وسياستهوصار الثاني هو الحاكم الرسمي للبلاد..الحاكم الشرعي..الوحيد ..الجمهوري المنتخب..بما لا يتعارض مع سياستهصار الاول خائن...واي من يظهر عليه علامه تمرد فإنه خائن مثله ويعدم فورا..لا يتعارض هذا مع القانون..فقد غطي عليه بسياستهعاد الظلم..عاد القهر..عاد الفقر وقله العيشعاد التمييز الاجتماعيوكيف له الا يعود وهناك قطيع من الخرفان الاغنام يمأمأون بانجازات الخنازير الواهية..الكاذبةيرددون الافكار المحرفه..يعلون بها صوتهم فوق اي صوت للمعارضهستتأثر بحق بمشهد اجتماع الناس بعد بضع شهور..يتذكرون ما كان ..ويقارونه بالانكيف ضاعت ثورتهم...كيف ضاع حلمهم..وكيف خفت صوت نشيدهميحاولوا التغني بنشيدهم مره اخري ...لربما بعث لهم الامل مجدداليفاجأوا بمنع الخنازير للنشيد..فالثوره انتهت بالنسبه للخنازير بحكمهم..وباعدامهم اخوانهم..المعارضون الخونه*************************ركب الخنازير الثورة وحموا حكمهم بالكلاب الشرسةوغطوا علي اخفاقاتهم وسرقاتهم بخنزيرهم المحنك اعلاميا يحيل الحق باطلا والباطل حقاتعاونوا مع الغراب الذي يدفع بغطاء ديني سماوي الحيوانات دفعا لتقبل معيشتهم الضنكهثم تحالفوا مع عدوهم الاصلي ليحكموا قبضتهم علي الحكموضعوا يدهم في يد الاعداء...حتي صار لافرق بين خنزيرا وانسان************************************لا اعتقد ان هذا ريفيو اساسا لروايه رائعه صاغها برمزيه وبراعه جورج اورويلهذا مجرد تلخيص ردئلقد عرفت الان لماذا لم تكتب احد اصدقائي هنا في الجودريدز ريفيو عن ذلك الروايه -بالرغم من غزاره ريفيوهاتها-..الروايه لا تستحق ريفيو اساساهي تقرأ وتستوعب فحسبولكن لنصارح أنفسنا ... أننا لم نتعظ من التاريخ بشكل مباشر...فكيف ان نتعظ من صورة رمزية له وإن كانت بمنتهي الأتقانفلنحاولربما ننجح يوما في ثورة لا تنتهي بمزرعة الحيواناتمحمد العربيفقط في 24 يونيو 2013""ملحوظه""-----قرأت تلك الرواية قبل احداث 30 يونيو 2013والغريب جدا ان بعد أعادة قراءتي للريفيو أجد أنها تصلح لنفس الحال بعد سنتين..نفس الريفيو الرمزي يصلح لأي وقت...بالضبط كالرواية..وسعدت أني كتبت الريفيو بالرمز مثلهاالعجيب فعلا ان الرواية تصلح لكل العهود السياسية التي أتت علينامصر قبل 25 يناير وبعدهامصر قبل 30 يونيو وبعدهاوبمجرد ان قرئتها..شعرت ان هذه الرواية يجب ان يتم تدريسها بالمدارس..فكل الاجيال تستحق هذا الوعي السياسيالا اني رايت سببا -وان اكاد ان اجزم انه ليس السبب الرئيسي لهذا- ان نهايتها المقبضه لا تتناسب لصغار السنولكن هذه النهاية المقبضة للاسف...واقعية",5.0

559,The Catcher in the Rye,Classics,"..Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.The Catcher in the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.
J.D. Salinger's
 (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.","journal entrytoday i am 15 years old. everything is all bullshit, as usual. i can't believe how fucked everything is around me. like i'm surrounded by zombies. i can't talk to any of my so-called friends, i can't talk to jamie, i can't talk to my parents. who would bother listening anyway. i cannot wait to leave orange county! this place makes me fucking sick. everyone is a hypocrite. everything is so goddamn bright and shiny and sunny and meaningless. FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?",5.0
560,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
561,The Handmaid’s Tale,Fiction,"Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now…Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.","06/24/22These are dark times…..‘I just don’t like her.’ ‘I heard she has a lot of emails.’ ‘But I really love Bernie! If I can’t have Bernie, I’m not voting for HER… I’m going to vote my conscience!’ Elections matter. This draconian decision overturning Roe endangers every woman of child baring age, and it’s just the beginning. This decision is not about life, it’s about controlling women. As racist as this country is, it’s much more misogynistic. Don’t believe me? Barack Obama.By not voting for Hillary Clinton, whatever your reasoning, you (each of you) put lives of these women in danger. You are responsible for their deaths. It’s that straight forward. But, I understand you were misled. This does not have to stand! You have all the power and can redeem yourselves! You HAVE to vote Democratic up and down the ballot in the midterms this fall, and in every election going forward. Just two more Democratic senators is all that is needed to kill the filibuster and codify Roe into federal law.The first thing that must be done in 2023, after the Democrats control the house and the senate (because, this time you listened to me) … is to expand the court. Also, impeach those idiots that were put in by a criminal president.Pregnancy is dangerous. Women die from pregnancy. This is a healthcare issue.Vote. Vote blue. Every time. You know better, now do better.05/03/22Well, well, well….A heartfelt ‘fuck you’ to everyone who said I was over reacting in November 2016. Expand the court!Kill the filibuster!VOTE BLUE!09/01/21RE: Texas (AKA Gilead)Told you so…so many times. I could go on, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Rich, white, women will ALWAYS be able to get abortions BTW. It’s about women’s bodily sovereignty and about the men who are salivating at the thought of controlling us. Now let’s air lift EVERYTHING with a vagina out of Texas.I don’t see a difference between Republicans and the Taliban; Do you?#KillTheFilibuster #ExpandTheCourt 02/13/21Today 43 Republicans, traitors to their country, worried about losing their jobs decided against growing a pair. Portman in Ohio who isn't running for re-election is the portrait of cowardice. He could have voted guilty, but he didn't. Moscow Mitch voted 'not guilty' then immediately turned around to make a speech about how guilty Donald is for inciting the insurrection! You can't have it both ways, Mitch! Why did he vote 'not guilty?' Because of process... one can't hold a trial for a president for his crimes after he's out of office for crimes he committed while in office (yet, a president can't be held responsible for his crimes whilst in office)... But, between January 6th and the 20th, Mitch shut down the senate and refused to call the senate back to hold the trail, when according to him, would have been the appropriate time to hold the trial. All of which is entirely bullshit. Donald was impeached while he was still in office so it was entirely appropriate (required, actually) to put him on trial after he left office. My head hurts.Someone please stuff lettuce in Mitch's mouth and turn him on his shell.01/06/21Sadly, it’s time for an update. In this book, Gilead took control of the United States government via a violent coup in which they kill all the members of congress at the capitol. Then martial law was enacted. Carry on.5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about ‘life’ it’s about controlling women. If you can’t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to ‘in cases of rape and incest’ is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you’re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can’t afford more, it doesn’t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don’t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women? My stars and garters!03/31/17. So, this Russia thing.... Am I right?2/5/17.....just another giant step towards making this book a reality, like they always dreamed of.Original review written in 2o12:WARNING: This review is being written after I worked a 13 hour day, with another one on the horizon tomorrow, and a glass of wine and while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Current events have put this book on the forefront of my mind, and damn it I got to get this out. I have never written a review on The Handmaid's Tale because I love the book, and it is so hard to write about a book you love. Ehh, what the hell.OfFred was a normal everyday woman with a career, a name, a life like all women have come to expect and take for granted in this age. When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don’t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So………I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise………..icky poor women. Now it’s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I’m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I’m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote……unless that’s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It’s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don’t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it’s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said… Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I’m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I’m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to…..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the ‘other’. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don’t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio….sigh) any more than a conservative want’s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who’s right or wrong here, I’ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half…HALF… the country didn’t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don’t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) “The advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.”-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump…..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is “a goodly amount of both”, but in this election sexism won and women lost.",5.0
562,The Alchemist,Fiction,"Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
563,Pride and Prejudice,Fiction,"Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work ""her own darling child"" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268","➸ 4 stars 

“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.”

— pride and prejudice by jane austen stands as a pinnacle of english literature, enchanting readers for over two centuries with its timeless tale of love, societal expectations, and personal growth. set in the genteel world of regency-era england, the story follows the spirited elizabeth bennet as she navigates the complexities of courtship, marriage, and social hierarchy. central to the story is elizabeth’s tempestuous relationship with the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, whose initial aloofness belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually wins elizabeth’s heart.one of my resolutions this year was to step out of my comfort zone and explore classic literature, and since i absolutely adore pride and prejudice (2005), i decided to start with this book. after reading this story, i can now comprehend why “pride and prejudice” has captured the hearts of so many over the years with its wit, social insight and timeless romance makes it a captivating read. i’m not sure why it wasn’t a 5 star read for me, but i think that the slow start made it a bit challenging, it was until volume three where i started to really enjoy the story.➷ austen’s language was, at first, bit of a challenge. while her prose is beautiful and rich, sometimes i would have to go back to reread a chapter to understand what was happening. but that’s just a me issue since i’m not really used to reading classics and i had to keep reminding myself this book was written over 200 years ago. but as the story progresses you can see how the writing is eloquently beautiful. watching the 2005 movie so many times definitely helped me understand everything better. 

“a lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”

➳ elizabeth bennett:elizabeth is such a strong fmc. she takes no nonsense from anyone and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. what makes elizabeth captivating is her unwavering sense of integrity and her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of pressure from her family and society. she is not willing to settle for a loveless marriage or a life of luxury if it means sacrificing her own happiness and autonomy. throughout the story, elizabeth faces numerous challenges and obstacles, from her family’s financial struggles to the pressures of societal expectations. yet, she navigates these difficulties with grace and resilience, never compromising her principles or sacrificing her sense of self. she had a tendency to be judgemental throughout the book. she quickly forms opinions about people based on limited information or first impressions. for example, she initially perceives mr. darcy as proud and arrogant, partly influenced by negative rumours that mr. wickham told her. but as the story goes on, she learns that maybe she shouldn’t be so quick to judge. — i absolutely adored her relationship with her sister, jane. they both share a special sisterly bond that is central to the story. throughout the book, they confide in each other, offer advice, and provide emotional comfort during times of joy and distress. their tight-knit bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, providing unwavering support and understanding. together, they navigate the complexities of society and matters of the heart, offering each other comfort and guidance along the way.➳ fitzwilliam darcy:「 ”dearest and loveliest elizabeth” 」opposite elizabeth bennet stands the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, a wealthy and reserved gentleman hailing from a noble lineage. initially shrouded in arrogance and reserve, darcy’s facade belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually unfolds throughout the narrative. at the beginning of the story, he is seen as arrogant and dismissive, particularly in his interactions with the bennet family. his reluctance to engage in social situations and his propensity to make quick judgments about others contribute to his unfavorable reputation. while undeniably flawed, darcy’s journey is marked by a profound transformation—one of the most compelling arcs in the story. despite his pride and acute awareness of social status, darcy emerges as a fundamentally good man, grappling with his own prejudices and ultimately learning to open his heart to love. through his struggles and growth, darcy embodies the novel’s central themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the transformative power of genuine connection.꒰ mr. darcy + elizabeth: ꒱they are the true heart of this story. the romance between mr. darcy and elizabeth bennet is a slow-burn journey that unfolds gradually throughout this book. at the outset, elizabeth is put off by darcy’s perceived arrogance and social status, while darcy is equally dismissive of elizabeth’s lower social standing and outspokenness. darcy’s letter to lizzy is a pivotal moment that shifts the dynamics of their relationship. it’s a sincere attempt by darcy to address the misunderstandings between them and explain his actions. through the letter, darcy opens up about his past and motivations, revealing a more complex and vulnerable side of himself. for lizzy, it’s a moment of reckoning, as she grapples with the new insights into darcy’s character and her own feelings towards him.darcy: i love you even though you’re poor, your family have no etiquette and they suck, but idc will you marry me?? lizzy: no like this will never not be funny!! she left that man flabbergasted, like what did he expect her to say after just insulting her and her family 😭

”in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.”

— overall, this book remains a timeless classic, cherished for it’s witty dialogue, memorable characters and enduring themes. it’s not just a romance but also a sharp critique of societal norms and expectations. through the journey of characters like elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy, jane austen offers timeless lessons about prejudice, self-discovery, personal growth and the power of love. it’s a book that is still adored and continues to resonate with readers generations later. ───♡─────────────in my classics era",4.0

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols.

Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
565,The Kite Runner,Fiction,"1970s Afghanistan: Twelve-year-old Amir is desperate to win the local kite-fighting tournament and his loyal friend Hassan promises to help him. But neither of the boys can foresee what would happen to Hassan that afternoon, an event that is to shatter their lives. After the Russians invade and the family is forced to flee to America, Amir realises that one day he must return to an Afghanistan under Taliban rule to find the one thing that his new world cannot grant him: redemption.","Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.",1.0

Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”","Kids are evil. Don't you know?I've just finished rereading this book for my book club but, to be honest, I've liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school. Overall, Lord of the Flies doesn't seem to be very popular, but I've always liked the almost Hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures. Make the characters all angel-faced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have? Just your average high school drama, but set on a desert island. With a bit more bloody murder. But not that much more.In 1954, when this book was published, Britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand - that it is not, in fact, the centre of the universe, and the British Empire was not a thing of national pride, but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings. Much of British colonialism had been justified as a self-righteous mission to educate and modernise foreign ""savages"". So when put into its historical context, alongside the decolonisation movements, this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white, Western supremacy. Of course, to a modern reader there's a lot of racism in this book. The racial aspect is a big factor. Golding establishes from the very first page that Ralph is a perfect white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, private school boy. And Piggy even asks ""Which is better - to be a pack of painted n*****s like you are or to be sensible like Ralph is?"" I'm not going to argue with anyone's interpretation, but I think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism. For me, I always saw it as Golding challenging the notion of savages being dark-skinned, uneducated people from rural areas. With this book, he says screw that, I'll show you savages! and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and gold-plated upbringing.I think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says 
""I should have thought that a pack of British boys - you're all British, aren't you? - would have been able to put up a better show than that.""
 Golding's way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it.Some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book, but I don't think that's true. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel - namely, the failure of democracy and the pro-authority stance - but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach. Plus, anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination. The fascinating thing about Lord of the Flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries. You could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative Jack Merridew as a kind of Hitler (or other dictator) who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest. Dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos... we do not have to assume that Golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil, only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations.Still a fascinating book after all these years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0
568,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Fantasy,"Harry Potter, along with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry can't wait to get back to school after the summer holidays. (Who wouldn't if they lived with the horrible Dursleys?) But when Harry gets to Hogwarts, the atmosphere is tense. There's an escaped mass murderer on the loose, and the sinister prison guards of Azkaban have been called in to guard the school...","I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0
569,One Last Shot,Christian Fiction,"When country music star Oaken Fox joins survivalist Mike Grizz's new adventure show in the Alaskan wilderness, he just wants to boost his fan base.

Too bad his producer has other plans--signing him on with Air One Rescue as a recruit and making a reality show.EMT Boo Kingston did not join Air One Rescue to train a celebrity. But she's a rookie to the team, so yes, she'll train Oaken and keep him alive and not for a minute pay attention to his charm.And then five women go missing from a resort during a bachelorette weekend gone wrong. Now, Air One and the rescue team will have to use all their skills and manpower--including Oaken--to find them before a blizzard settles in. But can they work together before tragedy strikes?","“Everyone makes mistakes. It’s how you recover that matters.”I loved this book. One Last Shot is the first book in the Alaska Air One Rescue series. It’s a clean romantic suspense.Saving lives in the last frontier is always a pull for me! The epic adventures and romance pulled me in and the beautiful story held my attention. By my criteria, I shouldn’t have liked this book:🤠 A male headshot cover🤠 A country music star🤠 A reality TV show backdropBut I did. THAT’S how good Susan May Warren is at writing suspense. She can take all the things I don’t care for and present them in a story that makes me binge-read, swoon and continually text my friend with bookish updates! Not giving anything away, but …✔️There’s a country music star who’s down on his luck and looking to make a comeback✔️There’s a rookie EMT who’s out to prove that she belongs ✔️There’s a bachelorette party gone wrong✔️A murder✔️Lots of air rescues✔️Ex-boyfriend drama✔️A blizzard✔️…. And the Kingston boys from Sky King Ranch!!!!I loved the opportunity to return to Copper Mountain, to meet the crew of Air One, and to read this inspiring book about trust, purpose, worth, judgment and forgiveness. My highlighter was going overtime with all the inspirational verses! I especially loved the lesson about sailboats vs rowboats and hearing about the inspiration for Boo and Oaken’s names.“You can blame God and go it alone. Or you can trust that God loves you and that he’ll carry you through the storm.”I purchased this ebook through the author’s website and got early access before publication!",5.0

With betrayal coming from within our ranks, my circle of trust grows smaller.Everything is about to change.","Oooh finally a cliffhanger that doesn’t shove you off the ledge lol. I think I’m gonna be in the minority when I say I liked the first half compared to the second. I liked the build up and the emotions compared to the action in this book. I also love the “is he or isn’t he” when it comes to relationships as well as figuring out your own self while trying to survive in a harsh situation, which is what Cam was doing. Ngl I feel so bad for Curi. I kinda want him to end up with Cam or at least let it be MFM at the end, bc I ain’t thrilled by Seraph and this book confirmed it for me. I need some major redemption and groveling and love bombing from him bc poor Cam has done so much for him and he’s caused her so much grief and for what? Looking forward to the next book.

But I was riveted. This is a book where things are constantly happening and changing and then you blink and notice you've spent hours on the book. There truly is something in it.

574,Kira and the (Maybe) Space Princess,Fantasy,"Fashionable fights, flashy attacks, and friends that are out of this world! This wacky and funny graphic novel series is a love letter to manga fans.

What could be better than that!

Is Kira's dream of being a Magical Girl really possible...or is Catacorn not really what she promises to be?","Small bit of review: I quite enjoyed this one. I had BIG issues with Kira, really wanted to sling her into space several times she was just so rude, but in the later half things went better in regards to her and I started to, very slowly, like her more. I loved art. Tulip was great. Catacorn was an interesting character and I loved finding out more about her. The transformation and the outfits and the actions were all just SO awesome and I now want to watch some mahou shoujo anime (well, technically I am watching one, but I mean a more pure mahou shoujo, teehee). I loved how the graphic novel got better and better and I loved the ending. It was just so fab. Oh, and plus points for the colours and sparkles. Also the cover was a lot of fun. Oh, and I liked the bonus extras, those made me happy. Oh, and I cannot forget that I love everyone living on Neo-Earth. Not just humans, but also mermaids, aliens, and others.

When a village comes under threat of siege, it offers an opportunity for seven kindlings to fight one last time. But war changed these warriors. And to reclaim who they once were, they will have to battle their pasts, their trauma, and their grim fates to come together again—or none of them will make it out alive.From bestselling and award-winning author Traci Chee comes a gut-wrenching, introspective fantasy about seven lost soldiers searching for the peace they once fought for and the future in which they’re finally daring to believe.",This was hurtful.

 by A. J. Landau (pseudonym for authors Jon Land and Jeff Ayers) starts with an explosion that topples the Statue of Liberty and maintains a relentless pace. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with the news and sent to New York as the agent-in-charge. However, upon arrival he quickly learns that Gina Delgado of the FBI will be overseeing the investigation. Due to Michael’s lack of a security clearance, he is barred from meetings of the Joint Task Force so he scours the grounds and finds a witness with key information on the attackers.Michael and Gina are likeable characters and readers get to see their points of view as well as that of a key supporting character and two antagonists. The multi-angled view of the characters allows readers to see how each character connects to the story; adding depth and complexity that is effective.The authors kept me rapidly turning the pages with gripping scenes, plenty of action and danger, a superb plot, and excellent writing. Along the way, readers also learn a bit about several national parks making this an educational as well as an exceptional thriller read. Despite the short chapters and switching scenes and characters, the flow worked well for me. A constant sense of urgency, a state of uneasiness, and lots of action combined with great characters and a well-written plot make this suspenseful novel a must read.Overall, this is a gritty, intense, and chilling story with complex characters. It’s intense and dramatic and kept this reader rapidly turning the pages. This is the first book in the National Parks Thriller series and I can’t wait for the next one. I recommend it to those who like political, action, and military thrillers. St. Martin’s Press and A. J.

581,Still See You Everywhere,Thriller,"She has called herself ""death,"" but people called her the devil.The case was sensational. Kaylee Pierson had confessed from the very beginning, waived all appeals. Despite the media’s chronicling of her tragic circumstances—the childhood spent with a violent father—no one could find sympathy for “the Beautiful Butcher” who had led eighteen men home from bars before viciously slitting their throats. Now, with only twenty-one days left to live, Pierson has finally received a lead on the whereabouts of the sister who was kidnapped over a decade ago, and she needs Frankie’s help to find her. The Beautiful Butcher’s offer: When was the last time your search ended with finding the living? Unable to resist the chance for a rescue, Frankie takes on Pierson’s request. Twelve years ago, five-year-old Leilani went missing in Hawaii. The main suspect? Pierson’s tech mogul ex-boyfriend, Sanders MacManus. Now, on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific—the site of MacManus’s latest vanity project—fresh evidence has appeared. In order to learn the truth and possibly save a young woman’s life, Frankie must go undercover at the isolated base camp. Her challenge: A dozen strangers. Countless dangerous secrets. Zero means of calling for help. And then the storm rolls in…","Thank you Grand Central Pub for the ARC. Please don't blocklist me. IYKYK, my reviews are ALWAYS honest.  Writing: I refuse to believe this is THEE Lisa Gardner | Plot: gave me nothing | Ending: stop it. stop it right now  SYNOPSIS Frankie Elkin is sent to an atoll off the shores of Honolulu to track down a serial killer's missing sister.  MY OPINION Respectfully... NO. Absolutely NOT. I was SO excited to read this one because even though Lisa Gardner and I have our differences, she is a WRITERRRRR. Her prose is very distinct, she clearly does her research, and her plots are always juicy. Sometimes a lil too juicy for my liking, but definitely entertaining. But THIS??? THIS RIGHT HERE???? Have you ever shoved a handful of tortilla chips into your mouth only to realize they're stale af? That's how reading this felt. Even if Lisa Gardner showed me a recording of typing every single word of this book, I would scream DEEP FAKE and run away. Let me stay in denial because this cannot be THEE Lisa Gardner who wrote one of my all-time favourite books, Live to Tell. This is like Dervla McTiernan's The Murder Rule (if you've been following my reviews for awhile, you KNOW how I felt about that one).To no on'e surprise, I did not read the first two books in this series. BUT, after finishing this piece of work, I picked up book #1 to confirm my suspicions that this was whack af. Where were Gardner's signature sentence fragments??? All I got was basic ass writing that was trending Freida McFadden. Yes. THAT bad. And what happened to Gardner's suspenseful storytelling? After getting off to a great start, we're stalled out learning about forest patterns and birds and big ass crabs for a solid 30% of the book. Frankie, you've been brought to the atoll to find Lea, stop tryna hit on your boss. Save some rizz for the rest of us please.Also, Frankie makes it clear that she doesn't find missing people for money and I'm convinced that's not by choice. In fact, SHE should be paying her clients for letting her make a mess of everything. Frankie is about as discreet as a straight man's line of sight when a phat ass walks by. She's allegedly undercover so either 1) she doesn't understand what that really means or 2) there is no second option, it has to be the first. And Frankie's special skill being that she ""asks the right questions"" was absolutely hilarious. I wouldn't even trust Frankie to ask a six-year-old what they had for dinner. I really didn't want to do any spoilies because the release date is so far away, but like Frankie, I just can't stfu...  SPOILERS ALERT. SCROLL TO BOTTOM Tbh because I'm a certified Gardner stan, I wanted to toss this a lil three stars, but the final showdown solidified this 2 star (which is still generous, considering). So, we find out that Lea and Kaylee were in cahoots. This makes no damn sense because why would Kaylee hire Frankie to find Lea??? Apparently it was the lawyer's fault, but this felt like a cop-out because Kaylee could've easily said absolutely not and refused to see her. Instead, she makes things extra complicated by sending Frankie's stupid ass to the atoll to blow her spot up. There was absolutely no reason Frankie needed to be there. It was like Mariana in The Maidens. GIRL YOU DON'T EVEN GO HERE!!!Anyways, Kaylee somehow escapes death row and makes it to the atoll, where she lets the chopper sing and then WINKS at Frankie as she darts into hiding. But wait, it gets more cringey. Frankie and the gang go to Mac's cabin to 'hide out', and decides the best course of action is to blurt out LEA YOU DID IT in front of everyone, including Lea of course. Scooby Doo would never. And despite Frankie's certainty that Lea is involved, everyone, including an undercover FBI agent, lets Lea chill out while they wait for Kaylee and her accomplice (Bill) to ... idk? Kill them all I guess. But here is where things got laughable: Frankie decides to lure Kaylee and Bill to them by........... LEAVING OUT A BOWL OF HOT N FRESH SPAGHETTI. YES, YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY.

583,Three-Inch Teeth,Mystery,"Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett faces two different kinds of rampaging beasts—one animal, one human—in this riveting new novel from #1 New York Times bestseller C.J. Box.A rogue grizzly bear has gone on a rampage—killing, among others, the fiancee of Joe’s daughter. At the same time, Dallas Cates, who Joe helped lock up years ago, is released from prison with a list of six names tattooed on his skin. He wants revenge on the people who sent him the people he blames for the deaths of his entire family and the loss of his reputation and property.    Targeted are a judge, the county prosecutor, his lawyer, a prison guard—and both Nate Romanowski and Joe Pickett. Using the grizzly attacks as cover, Cates devises a method of violence identical to the bear killings and sets out to methodically check off his list.","C. J. Box continues to excite readers with unique crime thrillers that are full of suspense and action. The twenty-fourth book in the series featuring Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett is mostly set in October in Saddlestring, Wyoming. A rogue grizzly bear is on a rampage in an area where there aren’t supposed to be any. Additionally, Dallas Cates is released from prison and wants revenge on the people who sent him there and who he blames for killing his family. Meanwhile, Joe’s oldest daughter, Sheridan Pickett, takes on her first solo assignment as a master falconer.The characters are well defined. Readers get a good feel for Joe, his wife Marybeth, and Sheridan. Their characters have depth, and by this time in the series, they feel like well-known friends. Joe is conscientious as always. Marybeth is inciteful and looks at situations very differently than Joe. Sheridan loves her job and is better with people than her boss Nate Romanowski. I loved seeing how Sheridan grew as the story unfolded. The author does a great job of capturing the various characters and the cultural lifestyles and differences. The writing is fluid and descriptive which helps readers envision the scenes without disrupting or slowing the flow. There was a strong sense of place causing me to feel as though I was living the events alongside the characters. The dynamic plot has a tremendous amount of conflict and action that kept me engaged throughout. It is twisty and heartrending with exciting scenes, a murderous antagonist, and an incredible setting.Box is an excellent storyteller who continues to bring suspense throughout this novel. Those who follow the series will enjoy learning more about Joe’s family. What an ending! I didn’t expect some of that to happen. The author surprised this reader with two unexpected twists and set the stage for the next book. This is an unforgettable novel with the devastating events that occurred. Coming to terms with them and understanding the fallout from the events will undoubtedly be threads readers will see soon. Overall, this was intriguing, gritty, chilly, suspenseful, and action-packed with compelling characters that kept me turning the pages as I sat on the edge of my seat. With exciting scenes and fascinating story lines that converge, this fantastic crime thriller was intense and dramatic. It kept me on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the novel. I’m looking forward to reading the next book in the series.PENGUIN GROUP Putnam, G.P. Putnam’s Sons provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

584,Twenty Years Later,Mystery,"But TWENTY YEARS LATER, to understand the present, you need to listen to the past… Avery Mason, host of American Events, knows the subjects that grab a TV audience’s attention. Her latest story—a murder mystery laced with kinky sex, tragedy, and betrayal—is guaranteed to be ratings gold. New DNA technology has allowed the New York medical examiner’s office to make its first successful identification of a 9/11 victim in years. The twist: the victim, Victoria Ford, had been accused of the gruesome murder of her married lover. In a chilling last phone call to her sister, Victoria begged her to prove her innocence. Emma Kind has waited twenty years to put her sister to rest, but closure won’t be complete until she can clear Victoria’s name. Alone she’s had no luck, but she’s convinced that Avery’s connections and fame will help. Avery, hoping to negotiate a more lucrative network contract, goes into investigative overdrive. Victoria had been having an affair with a successful novelist, found hanging from the balcony of his Catskills mansion. The rope, the bedroom, and the entire crime scene was covered in Victoria’s DNA. But the twisted puzzle of Victoria’s private life is just the beginning. And what Avery doesn't realize is that there are other players in the game who are interested in Avery’s own secret past—one she has kept hidden from both the network executives and her television audience. A secret she thought was dead and buried . . .  Accused of a brutal murder, Victoria Ford made a final chilling call from the North Tower on the morning of 9/11. Twenty years ago, no one listened. Today, you will.","I have a true affection for author Charlie Donlea, since his page-turning thrillers have busted me out of major reading slumps on more than one occasion. That said, his 2020 publication, The Suicide House, was a bit of a miss for me since there was just too much going on. So many characters, so many plot lines. While it pains me to say it, 2021’s Twenty Years Later suffers the same affliction. The start of this one feels like flipping through channels on TV. You bounce around from scene, character, and year, with a hope that at some point they’ll all come together. It took me until about the 30% mark to feel like I was getting invested in anything. Also, being a Donlea fan, I know that while his books can all be read as stand-alones, some of his characters pop up here and there. For example, his tried-and-true forensic pathologist Livia Cutty appears in a few scenes. The impact of this technique though made me constantly wonder if other characters were previously introduced in his other books and I’ve just forgotten them. Do their histories feel told rather than shown because there’s another entire book devoted to them? Or is this just another side effect of trying to cram too much into 300 pages?But here’s the real question for readers… Twenty years later, are you ready to read a thriller where the central storyline revolves around September 11th? Where real victims’ tragedy is exploited for entertainment value? Turns out I am not. I’ll direct you to the publisher synopsis, where there is an actual phone number* given to call. When I started writing this review, I was at 3.5 stars since I did end up flying through the back half of the book and still very much look forward to Donlea’s next one. But then I called that number. If it’s a spoiler to say what’s on the other end of the line, I really don’t care. It’s a recording of a fictionalized phone call from one of the characters stuck in the World Trade Center to her sister right before it collapses. I couldn’t even make it through 15 seconds of this absolutely vile marketing stunt. I hope the author didn’t approve this, and I hope it’s removed before major PR efforts roll out. *UPDATE (Sept. 2021): Since I initially posted this review back in June 2021, the publisher has removed the marketing stunt phone call I referenced from the book synopsis on Goodreads, Amazon and NetGalley. Wise decision!!!I received an advance readers copy to review courtesy of the publisher via Edelweiss. Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/",3.0
585,West with Giraffes,Historical Fiction,"“Few true friends have I known and two were giraffes…”Woodrow Wilson Nickel, age 105, feels his life ebbing away. But when he learns giraffes are going extinct, he finds himself recalling the unforgettable experience he cannot take to his grave.It’s 1938. The Great Depression lingers. Hitler is threatening Europe, and world-weary Americans long for wonder. They find it in two giraffes who miraculously survive a hurricane while crossing the Atlantic. What follows is a twelve-day road trip in a custom truck to deliver Southern California’s first giraffes to the San Diego Zoo. Behind the wheel is the young Dust Bowl rowdy Woodrow. Inspired by true events, the tale weaves real-life figures with fictional ones, including the world’s first female zoo director, a crusty old man with a past, a young female photographer with a secret, and assorted reprobates as spotty as the giraffes.Part adventure, part historical saga, and part coming-of-age love story, West with Giraffes explores what it means to be changed by the grace of animals, the kindness of strangers, the passing of time, and a story told before it’s too late.","a really sweet coming-of-age story that combines american history, animal friends, and a cross-country roadtrip. quite the fun adventure!whist reading this, i could tell that it was well-researched. i actually learned some things about the dust bowl era, which was unexpected. i think this does a great job at taking true events and presenting them in a way that is quite readable.the overall vibe of the story reminded me a lot of 'water for elephants,' but i didnt quite find this as emotional or impactful, which is why my rating is pretty average. i was just hoping for a little bit more to make me fall in love with this, and i never got it.still a really lovely story that i know will find its way to multiple bookclubs.↠ 3.5 stars",3.0
586,Don’t Forget to Write,Historical Fiction,"In 1960, a young woman discovers a freedom she never knew existed in this exhilarating, funny, and emotional novel by the bestselling author of She’s Up to No Good . When Marilyn Kleinman is caught making out with the rabbi’s son in front of the whole congregation, her parents ship her off to her great-aunt Ada for the summer. If anyone can save their daughter’s reputation, it’s Philadelphia’s strict premier matchmaker. Either that or Marilyn can kiss college goodbye. To Marilyn’s surprise, Ada’s not the humorless septuagenarian her mother described. Not with that platinum-blonde hair, Hermès scarf, and Cadillac convertible. She’s sharp, straight-talking, takes her job very seriously, and abides by her own rules…mostly. As the summer unfolds, Ada and Marilyn head for the Jersey shore, where Marilyn helps Ada scope out eligible matches—for anyone but Marilyn, that is. Because if there’s one thing Marilyn’s learned from Ada, it’s that she doesn’t have to settle. With the school year quickly approaching and her father threatening to disinherit her, Marilyn must make her choice for her future: return to the comfortable life she knows, or embrace a risky, unknown path on her own.","Don’t Forget to Write is perfect for when you need something light and fun, but also with a heart. Marilyn Kleinman is home for the summer from college when she’s caught making out with the rabbi’s son in the synagogue, she’s sent off to her great-aunt’s. It’s 1960 and Ada is the premier matchmaker in Philadelphia. “She wasn’t warm and she suffered no fools. But no one had a better heart than this indomitable battle-ax before me.” Whenever Ada was in the picture, I was hooked. I was not as entranced with Marilyn. At times she verges on being petulant, acting more like 15 than 20. But then, she still had some growing up to do and had to learn how to stand up for herself and her beliefs. The story is true to the time and place, especially the New Jersey seaside, and it was so easy to envision every scene. The ending was perfect and I will admit to being caught off guard in one aspect. Prepare for lots of laughs and a few tears.

I don’t usually post a full-review of a manga/manhwa series I’ve read here, but Solo Leveling demands, at least, a little write-up because my god, everyone needs to bless their eyes and mind with the entertaining experience of reading this. It takes a lot for a manga/manhwa series to blow my mind now, and Solo Leveling accomplished this feat non-stop.Solo Leveling is a manhwa adaptation—illustrated by Gi So-Ryeong (기소령) and Jang Sung-Rak (장성락)—of a completed series of light novels with the same title that’s written by Chu-Gong. The official blurb from the light novel did a great job of explaining the premise without spoiling anything, so I’ll copy it here:

“10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as ""Hunters"". However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the ""World's Weakest"". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!” 

It’s a simple premise, nothing revolutionary, but it’s executed magnificently; Sung Jin-Woo’s journey in his endless pursuit of a stronger power was simply a blast to read. And I’m not saying that the manhwa is without its flaws. The author seemed to have forgotten—for almost 50 chapters—that the reason Sung Jin-Woo became a hunter in the first place was to earn money to pay for the medical expense of his sick mother. Plus, Sung Jin-Woo is just extremely overpowered. But you know what? I don’t care. This manhwa is a personification of badass main character and action scenes, and everything worked well for the story and medium; I’m willing to overlook the minor flaws in favor of the powerfully engrossing and immensely addictive reading experience. Also, I loved the nod to other popular franchises: One Punch Man training method, Alex Armstrong from Full Metal Alchemist cameo, and the design of Artorias the Abyss from Dark Souls. I could be wrong about these, of course, but they seemed too similar to be considered a coincidence, especially the later story arc resemblance to the Chimera Ant arc from Hunter x Hunter. Case in point:Picture: Igris from Solo Leveling.Picture: Artorias the Abyss from Dark Souls video game.Gi So-Ryeong (기소령) and Jang Sung-Rak (장성락) are virtuoso of illustrations; I truly believe that the reason this manhwa reaches the popularity and acclaim it has now is due to their irreplaceable contributions as an artist. The level of explosive actions and vivid artworks displayed in this manhwa, for the lack of a better term, is godlike. A picture is worth a thousand words, and rather than hearing me ramble on about how beautiful and well-drawn the illustrations are, I’ll provide proofs instead:Yes, every single panel of this manhwa is drawn with at least the superb caliber shown above.Solo Leveling is an outstandingly phenomenal manhwa that deserves all the praises it gets and more. Forgive me for saying this, but Season 1 of this series alone has made every other LitRPG I’ve ever experienced pale in comparison. Seriously, I honestly never thought I would ever read a LitRPG as addictive, mind-blowing, and page-turning as this, but here we are. I highly recommend this to pretty much everyone. Only Season 1 has been completed at the moment, but trust me when I say that this manhwa is going to take over the world. Join in the hype now. I can’t wait for Season 2 to begin and see the—hopefully—terrifying challenges the Sung Jin-Woo encounter.

The first guy was electrocuted and another fell out a hospital's window. Who would want them dead and why? Reacher and others are in a race against time before the ruthless killers strike again.

589,City in Ruins,Fiction,"Following  City on Fire  and  City of Dreams ,  City in Ruins  is the explosive, impossible to put down conclusion to  New York Times  bestselling author Don Winslow’s epic, genre-defining crime trilogy and the final book of Winslow's extraordinary career. Sometimes you have to become what you hate to protect what you love. Danny Ryan is rich. Beyond his wildest dreams rich. The former dock worker, Irish mob soldier and fugitive from the law is now a respected businessman – a Las Vegas casino mogul and billionaire silent partner in a group that owns two lavish hotels. Finally, Danny has it a beautiful house, a child he adores, a woman he might even fall in love with. Life is good. But then Danny reaches too far. When he tries to buy an old hotel on a prime piece of real estate with plans to build his dream resort, he triggers a war against Las Vegas power brokers, a powerful FBI agent bent on revenge and a rival casino owner with dark connections of his own. Danny thought he had buried his past, but now it reaches up to him from the grave to pull him down. Old enemies surface, and when they come for Danny they vow to take  everything  – not only his empire, not just his life, but all that he holds dear, including his son. To save his life and everything he loves, Danny must become the ruthless fighter he once was – and never wanted to be again. Ranging from the gritty back rooms of Providence, RI to the power corridors of Washington, DC and Wall Street to the golden casinos of Las Vegas,  City in Ruins  is an epic crime novel of love and hate, ambition and desperation, vengeance and compassion.","City in Ruins is the epic conclusion to Winslow’s City on Fire-Danny Ryan crime fiction trilogy, charting the tragic fall of the warring Murphy and Moretti organized crime families in Providence, Rhode Island. These Irish and Italian mob families were always at war, but the troubles really started when Liam Murphy saw Helen of Troy (Pam Moretti) at the clambake on the beach. Like Paris of the Trojan War, Liam absconded with the goddess and the war began because Paulie Moretti had been disrespected and, by blood, Peter Moretti, too. The spectacular first novel in the series (City on Fire) is not to be missed and contains enough fireworks for a lot of Fourth of Julys. Book Two, City of Dreams, picks up with the aftermath of everything that happened in City on Fire. The survivors are barely able to hold it together. The Irish mob is decimated and Danny Murphy took what was left of his crew and headed to Hollywood with his well-connected mother’s help. A movie is being made about the fireworks in Providence with the Altar Boys being the named consultants. Murphy, after helping out the CIA with a raid on a drughouse and running off with proceeds, resurfaces in Hollywood, becomes the producer for the film, and has a hot romance with the star of the movies, falling for the star playing Pam’s role in the movie, and ending up on the cover of every newspaper and magazine in the country. All hell breaks loose. Meanwhile, back in Providence, the Morettis are at each other’s throats – literally, with essentially taking out each other in an intra-family feud of epic proportions. In the end, there is nowhere for any of these guys to turn because the old life is gone and the walls are all closing in on them. Now on to volume three- City in Ruins- as if there was any tragedy left to happen to these two families.City in Ruins primarily focuses on Danny Ryan with a few short glances at the Morettis with Peter Moretti, Jr., on trial for murdering the mob boss Vinnie and Peter’s own mother. Meanwhile, Chris Palumbo is living in North Dakota with a woman he met by accident, squirreling the money he has left in the attic and rafters and letting this woman support him. His wife Cathy is back in Providence, left holding the bag. The other Italian toughs think Chris walked away with millions in the drug money and they are going to take it out of Cathy’s businesses brick by brick dollar by dollar until she has nothing left to sell but herself. Chris can’t stay in hiding forever or can he? It is another tragedy bubbling up. Chris is like Odyseuss returning from twenty years away to find Penelope fighting off dozens of suitors and his young son not up to the task yet.Danny Ryan has resurrected himself like a phoenix rising from the ashes and is the hot new star of the Las Vegas Strip casinos, locked in an eternal competition with Vern Winegard for control of the strip. The dirty money from the mob and the drug house has been washed and diluted and Danny can control a casino fortune and date a legitimate woman. Nevertheless, the theme keeps coming up that Danny Ryan is not quite a legitimate businessman and no matter what deals he makes, his mob connections from the past keep coming up. There is no way to ever have fully clean hands for this generation.City in Ruins is a blockbuster finale to an epic crime trilogy charting the tragedy that are these two Providence crime families, trying to claw their way out of bloody hell.",5.0
590,Extinction,Thriller,"Erebus Resort, occupying a magnificent, hundred-thousand–acre valley deep in the Colorado Rockies, offers guests the experience of viewing woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths in their native habitat, brought back from extinction through the magic of genetic manipulation. When a billionaire's son and his new wife are kidnapped and murdered in the Erebus back country by what is assumed to be a gang of eco-terrorists, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Agent Frances Cash partners with county sheriff James Colcord to track down the perpetrators. As killings mount and the valley is evacuated, Cash and Colcord must confront an ancient, intelligent, and malevolent presence at Erebus, bent not on resurrection but on extinction.","In 
Extinction,
 Douglas Preston combines a technothriller with a police investigation. Erebus Resort occupies a large valley in Eagle County, Colorado, deep in the Rocky Mountains. It offers guests the unique experience of viewing six herbivores, including woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths, brought back from extinction through genetic manipulation. When billionaire Rolf Gunnerson’s son Mark and his wife Olivia are abducted while in the Erebus back county, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is called in to help the Eagle County sheriff’s department. This is Agent in Charge Frances Cash’s first case after her promotion to senior detective. She liaises with Sheriff James Colcord to investigate and tract down the culprits.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Cash is organized, detailed, goal-oriented, aggressive, foul-mouthed at times, sharp-tonged, and doesn’t like small talk. She’s viewed by her boss, McFaul, as lacking the public relations side of things and only being focused on solving her cases. Colcord is a movie buff, quiet, treats others with respect, and gets along with most people. However, he can also be forceful and take charge of situations.The author has penned a thriller with action, wonderful animals, plenty of adventure, great lead characters, and genetic engineering that is frightening, exciting, and thought-provoking. This riveting and suspenseful story kept be fully engaged from beginning to end. The plot is twisty with several shocking turns that caught me by surprise. The world-building was excellent from the back-country to the resort lodge to the laboratory. Themes include genetic engineering, deception, betrayal, death, greed, morality, work relationships, and much more.Overall, the book is tense, gripping, and suspenseful. It kept me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would be uncovered next. With great characterization and world-building as well as a fast pace, it’s also thought-provoking and terrifying at times. The afterward at the end of the book has some interesting information as well. I highly recommend this novel to those who enjoy thrillers, police procedurals, near-science science fiction, and mysteries. I hope there is a sequel. I purchased a copy of this novel.

With the help of Facebook, Zara has tracked him down and is asking if his parents are the other couple in the old photo? And if so, could he bring them to Vegas for a surprise reunion?What Zara and Aiden don’t know is that thirty years ago, One Moment In Time changed everything.Will rewinding the clock right the wrongs of the past?Or are they all counting down to a rendezvous with disaster?","In a Nutshell: Contains some surprises and some shocks, exactly as promised. Good for fans of women’s fiction as this is mostly an entertainer.Story Synopsis: Colin and Brenda got married almost thirty years ago in a chapel in Las Vegas. To celebrate their upcoming thirtieth wedding anniversary, their daughters Zara and Millie decide to give them a surprise by flying them from Glasgow to Las Vegas to renew their vows. The girls are also trying to locate the two strangers standing next to their parents in their wedding photo, hoping for a reunion of old friends.What the girls don’t know is that Brenda is secretly nursing regrets and planning to leave Colin soon. And they also don’t know that the two pairs of people in the photo might not necessarily be the best of friends. Playing a role in this complicate plan is Aiden Gregg, whom Zara tracked through Facebook to check if he knows the identity of the strangers in the wedding photo. As the strangers turn out to be his parents, he has to help Zara complete her plan by bringing them to Las Vegas in time for the reunion and the renewal of the vows. As you can expect, the well-intentioned surprise soon turns into a shocker. The story comes to us in the third person perspectives of Zara, Aiden, and their moms Brenda and Eileen.Bookish Yays:✔ The premise promises an entertaining read, and entertainment is what we get. There are many humorous scenes, balanced with some heartfelt relationship struggles. There’s love and lust and anger and pride and confusion – almost all the emotions that make this genre what it is.✔ The author’s choice of narrators was excellent. While there is a multitude of interesting characters in this book, the four voices she chose offer a balance of reason, emotion and confusion throughout the story. I am not saying that I liked all the four narrators, but I found them interesting character studies.✔ The remaining characters, whether appealing or irritating, are also written well. Of these, Millie was my favourite – I loved her unapologetic behaviour. But more importantly, I loved how her character growth wasn’t modified to make her fit into a conventional role by the end. Her essence stays the same throughout. The bond between siblings Zara and Millie is just awesome, though they are so contrary to each other.✔ It was a nice experience to see fifty-plus characters driving the story along with their young ones. I enjoyed the distinct portrayal of the four parents, each so different in personality.✔ The book takes its time to get rolling, with the initial one-third or so functioning more as a backstory than as the main plot. But once the main story sets off in Las Vegas, the ride is mostly quick and smooth. My patience was tested but also rewarded. ✔ Loads of love, no steam. Plus point for me; possible minus for some other readers. ✔ I liked *most* of the ending – it was realistic rather than contrived, and grew from the natural progression of the story and the characters. Not everyone gets a traditional HEA, and not everyone necessarily “matures”. Bookish Nays:❌ There are quite a few relationships dissolving and forming in the course of the plot. Most of these can be guessed well in advance, with one major exception. And this unexpected relationship was not at all convincing to me. It felt forced and rushed, not to mention very awkward. I couldn’t digest the fact that the characters involved accepted it so easily. ❌ The final quarter feels very rushed; too much happening too quickly. ❌ There’s much focus on the physical attributes and appearance of the characters. ⚠ Minor complaint: Can we please not have fictional besties sharing the same initials? Things get confusing! I was grateful that Bernadette didn’t have a longer role to play in Brenda’s arc. Overall, if you are a women’s fiction lover, then this book will offer you exactly what you expect from this genre – surprises and shocks, sweet moments and sad events, old heartaches and new bonds. While most of it goes as expected, the grounded ending elevates the experience. It will work well when you want a feel-good read mixing up light and heavy topics. This was my first Shari Low book, and I can see why she has so many fans. I would love to explore more of her works. 3.75 stars.My thanks to Boldwood Books and NetGalley for the DRC of “One Moment in Time”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available on Kindle Unlimited.———————————————Connect with me through:

592,Judgment Prey,Mystery,"Alex Sand was spending the evening at home playing basketball with his two young sons when all three were shot in cold blood. A wealthy federal judge, there’s no short list of people who could have a vendetta against Sands, but the gruesome murders, especially that of his children, turn their St. Paul community on its head. Sand was on the verge of a major donation to a local housing charity, Heart/Twin Cities, and with the money in limbo, eyes suddenly turn to his grieving widow, Margaret Cooper, to see what she might do with the money. Margaret, distraught over the death of her family, struggles to move forward, and can’t imagine how or why anyone would target her husband.With public pressure mounting and both the local police force and FBI hitting dead end after dead end, Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers are called in to do what others could not: find answers. With each potential lead flawed, Davenport and Flowers are determined to chase every theory until they figure out who killed the Sands. But when they find themselves being stonewalled by the most unlikely of forces, the two wonder if perhaps each misdirection could lead them closer to the truth.","I love reading the Lucas series and I'm always giddy when Virgil makes a surprise appearance. Now that I know I can expect to see Virgil, part of that excitement is missing but hey I'm not gonna complain, I love when they team up. Lucas and Virgil are my favorite ""cop"" characters and I can count on them cracking jokes and playing off one another while they investigate the murders.After being shot multiple times in the previous novel, US Marshal Lucas is still recovering when his boss calls late at night about the murder of a respectable federal judge and his two teenage boys at their home.St. Paul PD, FBI, and BCA are on this high-priority case, but inevitably Lucas and Virgil join the hunt for the killer. I enjoyed this plotline a bit more than the other related mystery with the charity projects.Although, pretty unrealistic, Cooper and her pal are bonkers and their own investigation is very entertaining to witness. Imagine combing through their search history of ""how-to"", huh?Still, the very best part is Lucas and Virgil's sarcastic banter in Lucas' hybrid Cayenne while on the road from one suspect to the next. Great and fluid dialogs. And Virgil the novelist or is it Sandford's in the book? 🤩 I'm glad the author left politics out for the most part. What I'm uncertain about is the MOTIVE. It was never really explained, I can only assume... 4.5⭐Really miss Richard Farrone, RIP.💔Thank you G.P. Putnam's Sons for the DRCPublished Oct 3, 2023!",4.0
593,The Chaos Agent,Thriller,"A car accident in Japan.A drowning in Seoul.A home invasion in Boston.Someone is killing the world’s leading experts on robotics and artificial intelligence. Is it a tech company trying to eliminate the competition or is it something even more sinister?After all, artificial intelligence may be the deadliest battlefield gamechanger since the creation of gunpowder. The first nation to field weapons that can act at the speed of computer commands will rule the battlefield.It’s an irresistible lure for most, but not for the Gray Man. His quest for a quiet life has led him to Central America where he and his lover, Zoya Zakharova, have assumed new identities. With a list of enemies that  includes billionaires, terrorists, and governments, they need to keep a low profile, but the world’s deadliest assassin can’t expect to hide out forever.Eventually, they’re tracked down and offered a job by an old acquaintance of Zoya’s. He needs their help extracting a Russian scientist who is on the kill list. They reject the offer, but just being seen with him is enough to put assassins on their trail.Now, they’re back on the run, but no matter which way they turn, it's clear that whoever's tracking them is always going to be one step ahead. Since flight’s no longer possible, fight is the only option left, and no one fights dirtier than the Gray Man.","Mark Greaney brings together a contemporary topic, diverse characters, multiple settings, and plenty of action in the thirteenth novel in the Gray Man series. In this latest book artificial intelligence leads to a shocking and alarming scenario. Someone is killing the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and robotics. Is it a tech company eliminating the competition, a country intent on military superiority, or something even more ominous? The Gray Man - Court Gentry and Zoya Zakharova have assumed new identities and are living together in Guatemala. Both have governments and individuals as their enemies and are trying to keep a low profile. Unfortunately, that is about to change. They’re tracked down and offered a job by an acquaintance of Zoya’s. Despite rejecting the offer, being seen with him is enough to have assassins pursue them. On the run they realize that whoever wants them dead seems to be one step ahead of them. It’s time to fight back.Court, a former CIA operative, is drawn to danger, misses making an impact, and suffers from insomnia. Zoya is motivated by causes and mainly wants to survive. There are a host of additional characters, but it was easy to keep track of them. Readers get various points of view throughout the novel with the initial chapters introducing many of them and their situations.Greaney is an excellent storyteller who kept me on the edge of my seat with gripping scenes, action, a superb plot, and fantastic writing. In preparation for this series, he not only traveled to multiple countries but trained extensively in the use of firearms, battlefield medicine, and close-range combative tactics. The dynamic plot came alive and felt all too possible with real-world issues around artificial intelligence incorporated into the story highlighting the societal and political differences.A constant sense of urgency, a state of uneasiness, and lots of action combined with great characters and a well-written plot make this suspenseful novel a must read. My only quibble was one aspect of the ending. However, this undoubtedly sets the stage for the next book in the series. Themes include artificial intelligence, deception, trust, industrial espionage, violence, differing political and social ideologies, murder, and much more.Overall, this is a gripping, gritty, and chilling story with complex characters. It’s intense and dramatic and kept this reader turning the pages. I recommend this series to those who like political, action, and military thrillers. While this series is best read in order to fully understand the backstories of the main characters, this one worked as a standalone novel for me.Berkley Publishing Group and Mark Greaney provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

594,Dark Dive,Mystery,"A Wall Street Journal bestselling series. Searching for a missing diver takes a Florida detective on a deep-diving adventure in a gripping thriller by the Amazon Charts bestselling author of Sea Castle . After the Underwater Investigation Unit’s disbandment, public outcry ushers Sloan McPherson and her partner, former navy diver Scott Hughes, back into the depths of crime solving. But Sloan’s return comes with a personal case. Longtime family friend Fred Stafford has disappeared. Left his abandoned truck in the vicinity of an unmarked sinkhole and new findings that have Sloan second-guessing everything she thought she knew about the man. There are his gambling debts, his association with a treasure-hunting band of underwater cavern junkies called the Dive Rats, and most alarming of all, a discovery in Stafford’s storage shed that raises the stakes even higher and plunges Sloan into an unfathomable mystery. As Sloan’s investigation unfolds, a tragic Florida cold case, local superstitions, and a shocking conspiracy collide. For Sloan, finding Stafford and uncovering the buried secrets of the past soon drag her deeper into the dark unknown than she feared.","I have a theory (of course I do). By book five in a mystery series, we know it is going to be, well, A Series, meaning the author has developed a brand, certain genre conventions will be adhered to and, most importantly, the author has practiced enough to be decent at what they are doing. But here’s the hypothesis part: the author finally has enough publishing security to start to challenge themselves and the readers to break from earlier patterns. I present as evidence Matthew Scudder book 5 and 6, (Eight Million Ways to Die and When the Sacred Ginmill Closes), two of my favorites; Elvis Cole 4 and 6 (Free Fall and Sunset Express); Charlie Parker 4 and 6 (The White Road and The Unquiet). Possibly I could go on, but this is about Mayne and how Dark Dive, book five in Payne’s Underwater Investigation series, dares to diverge from its predecessors and becomes an even more interesting book.The series is about a statewide Underwater Investigations Unit which ostensibly is brought in when there are cases that involve diving, particularly evidence retrieval. It is a small unit, comprised of a charismatic, politically-savy head, George; our narrator and archeologist in-training, Sloan; ex-Navy diver and tech-geek, Hughes, introduced in book 2; and the more recent ex-PD detective and data miner, Gwen, from book 4. (If you are getting the feeling you should read the series in order, that is quite possibly true. It depends on your tolerance for continuity). Prior to this, the Unit had seen some rocky political ground and temporary disbandment, but all is copacetic now. As a reader, I found this a huge relief; while intrusive agency politics may be a draw for some, I find them about as fun as kingdom politics in fantasy series, which is to say, hardly at all. It is enjoyable to witness the team each perform their roles in competent ways and try to solve the puzzles they are presented with.And what a puzzle! A dive shop owner is concerned a well-known but eccentric diver has gone missing; the soon-to-be ex-girlfriend had filed a missing persons report but his new diving buddies are clueless and strangely unconcerned. As Sloan starts asking questions, she discovers she hardly knew the man. The case gets more complex in diverging but extremely interesting ways and I was on board for it, if a little confused once or twice. But here’s the thing–I want to re-read it because of it. It is one of those mysteries where the complexity invites one to think and reconsider, much like re-watching a magic trick. “Wait, show me again,” is, in my estimation, a good response to have in both scenarios.Writing continues to improve. Sloan’s main focus in the case and she doesn’t spend a ton of time in the emotional back-and-forth of family dynamics, one of the areas where I have historically felt characterization was more weak. The endless glades of southern Florida really come alive, as do the deep sinkholes, and I felt myself in that muggy, grassy plain listening to insects buzz. Yep, definitely want to re-read it again (but honestly, not revisit the Glades again). There are a few spots where I felt a careful editor might have improved sentence flow or word choice, but on the whole, I'm going to say it's above competent.My deepest hesitation is the ending, which felt a little like it jumped the shark. Well, whatever; got to give the genre what it expects, I suppose, but that was what left me with the most questions the next day. Aside from that, it would have been an easy five stars for an engaging story and puzzling mysteries. I definitely recommend it.many thanks to Netgalley for the advanced e-copy for review. all opinions are you know, like, my own, man",5.0
596,The Hunger Games,Young Adult,"The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
597,Catching Fire,Young Adult,"Flames are spreading.And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol—a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create. Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest that she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before . . . and surprising readers at every turn.","I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don’t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. Catching Fire was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don’t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass Katniss Everdeen, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything’s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn’t start out that way. It’s very Lord of the Flies, and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale, but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It’s a big party, and they’re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she’s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy, and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I’m not the hero. So, that’s about three times this month that I’ve been on the side of terrorists. I don’t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin’ pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there’s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I’m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you’re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!)When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn’t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called “True Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.” The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It’s a seriously creepy theory, but I’m not kidding when I say that she’s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I’ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don’t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as “violence is not the answer” or, on the other side of the argument, “destroy civilization.” I’m not positive what the right answer is, but I’d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives?So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don’t know if you’ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil.",5.0
598,Mockingjay,Young Adult,"Why am I not dead?I should be dead.Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans—except Katniss.The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay—no matter what the personal cost.","SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one! She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray). The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that ""this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!"" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions. That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: ""I must be the Mockingjay"", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the ""normal, average teen"" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like ""Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that."" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of ""realism"" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this ""Diary of an Emo Puppet."" This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title ""girl who was on fire"" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say ""Enough is enough."" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old. I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book). Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and ""give up on mankind""? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:""Because,"" said Harry, ""sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!""""You're seventeen, boy!""""I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!"" a few sentences later .. ""I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.""Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature.",2.0
599,Divergent,Young Adult,"In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.","What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.  Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another. Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of. AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me.",2.0
600,Insurgent,Young Adult,"But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.New York Times bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.","I want to give a big old round of applause to HarperTEEN and their insane marketing campaign. Bravo. That is not mockery, but a legit salute. I sincerely have to give it up to you for convincing me that I had to own this book. I was caught up and boarded the Twitter hype train as it drove me round and round the blogosphere's Factions. (BTW, I still don't know who drives the damn train.) So, by the time I stepped into my local bookstore and laid eyes on Insurgent I happily handed over my $17.99. I wasn't thinking logically. It was as if I was under a simulation. (HAHAHA! Did you see what I did there?)And that ending? Ugh. I... I... I need a moment. Let me just stop myself right here before I end up writing a really negative review and 1 starring one of the most anticipated books of 2012. But know I am displeased. VERY. Just look at how long it took me to finish the book! -----------------------------------------------What a shame. The most anticipated book of 2012 is my most disappointing read so far. After all the positive reviews I read, I knew for sure I'd love it. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. I was conflicted on whether to give this book one or two stars. In the end, Insurgent's saving grace is that it simply doesn't belong with some of my other one starred books. So, I feel I must warn whoever stumbles across this review: If this is one of your favorite series and you love it with the burning passion of a supernova, this review might have the potential to piss you off. It might be best for both you and I if you just hit the back button now before things get going. Go on. Spock and I will wait.*whistles*Oh, you're staying, huh? Well, strap yourself in because I have a feeling it might just be one of those reviews...Spock tells me this review must contain mild spoilers in order to logically explain this illogical novel. Sorry, kids. Spock's call.The first big negative right off the bat was that Insurgent picks up directly after Divergent left off. There is virtually no recap to the story or characters and if you read the book a year ago, well, you may be screwed. But thankfully, Roth wrote up a lovely little cheat sheet for just this purpose. Yay! However, the problem doesn't just lie with remembering names. It lies with the connection the reader may or may not have had with the characters in Divergent, which was now non-existent since I could barely remember who was who. What's that you say? So and so just got shot in the head? I'm sorry, I can't find a single fuck to give. Then, we are introduced to even more characters. So, not only do I have to attempt to remember the old characters, but I have to keep track of these newbies too? That's just way too much work. Obviously, this isn't really Insurgent's fault, but I thought it would helpful to point this out.The Plot:What happened here? What happened to the action packed dystopian series I was introduced to in Divergent? Where the hell was Tris and why was Bella playing her role? Why did Four suddenly update his Facebook status to Douche Bag? Who's idea was it to turn Insurgent into a Dystopian Romance? One thing I loved about Divergent was that the romance took a back seat to the story and action. But in Insurgent the action is scattered with a heavier focus on Tris and Four's relationship. Look, that is not what I signed up for. I really don't care if Four loves Tris or if they'll end up riding a unicorn that poops rainbows as they ride off into the sunset. Whatever, whatever, whatever.So, the Erudite are trying to take over their world by creating a new serum for those that are Divergent while the Factionless plan a rebellion. But all that usually happens in the background with occasional mention to keep the reader up to date. Most of the novel we are stuck in Tris' head as she goes into angst mode over Four, her parents and Will. It was so boring I felt like I was stuck in a throwback episode of As the World Turns. On repeat. Save me. But wait! We have a random plot twist at the end right before the battle is about to go down. Marcus (Four's abusive father) decides to enlist Tris to help him retrieve information stolen from Abnegation. He tells her it's super secret and that he can't tell her what it is because it's something you have to see, that she'll just have to trust him. Doing so would betray Four. She agrees.Wait. Pause.Tris hates Marcus. Tris loves Four. Tris doesn't know what information they would be retrieving. She also doesn't know if Marcus is telling her the truth. She has absolutely no reason to believe him. No real evidence to back up his claim. She agrees. Without much thought. Tris is supposed to have an aptitude for Erudite, right? She's supposed to be logical, RIGHT?!Tris, pack your bags. I think Spock has just voted you off the island.That makes no sense! And then when I found out the super big secret, guess what? He could have easily told her! I smell and easy plot cop-out, folks. The secret is kept long enough from the reader just so it can push you off the cliff on the last page.World Building:In Divergent I let a lot slide and roll off me because I was entertained throughout the entire book. I'm known to do that with a lot of books like Wither and Across the Universe, for example. I could not do it with Insurgent. You see, I have the attention span of a fruit fly. If I'm not fully engaged in the book, I'm going to notice things. Things I probably wouldn't care too much about if I were enjoying myself. Like how the Erudite wear glasses just because they're smart. Or how even though Tris is emotionally unbalanced 16-year-old, everyone still looks to her to ""analyze the situation."" Or even how impossible I find these factions. How is it that you can put all of these traits into neat little boxes and ask a person to choose one over the others? This is the same problem I had with The Hunt. In both novels the author tries to pitch an idea of human behavior completely different from what reality is, but you can clearly see the flaws with it. However, the main character fully believes in that world and way of thinking. They try to rationalize it, convince you of it. Yes, I realize it's a Dystopian novel, but this is a hard concept to sell because it makes it difficult for me to sympathize with the main character, their conflicted feelings and understand their world. Believability is key for me and I have a hard time believing this world. Tris frequently switches back and forth between her Dauntless, Erudite and Abnegation sides. Other characters comment on her embracing one trait depending on what the situation calls for it. But this doesn't work for me. Real talk, you can't just put logical thinking back in the toy chest when you decide you don't want to play with it anymore. It doesn't work like that. At least... I don't think so. Spock?I'm getting no-ish vibes.Tris:This series gets a lot of comparisons to The Hunger Games and in a way I can see why. You have your young girl who, one way or another, plays an important part in bringing forth change to her society. And if I really had to compare the two, I'd say that Insurgent is like Mockingjay. Tris is depressed, struggling to hold it together and fight in the war. The difference comes into play when Tris borderline gives up, while Katniss kicked ass until the very end. I'm not saying Tris didn't have the right to be depressed because I do believe she did. But it was really over done for me. I felt like I was drowning in her angst. This book is over 500 pages long and most of the action doesn't even show up to the party until the last 30 pages! So what was Tris doing for the other 500 pages? Not a damn thing. No, scratch that. Spock tells me that is inaccurate. Tris was in fact doing something. She was off being selfless, trying to get herself killed so that no one else would die. Bella is that you? I didn't know you did Dystopias now! That irritated me to no end. At one point she turns herself into the Erudite because they threatened to kill off people until Divergent started surrendering. So, of course, Tris thinks it has to be her and sneaks off to give herself up before the Dauntless can form a plan. Now, let's think about this logically. Tris knows the Erudite want to experiment on her for a Divergent-proof serum. Which means more people would be enslaved and/or killed because of her turning herself in. *facepalm* Then she almost dies, but it was too late because I had run out of fucks by then! So I had to shake Spock down for some.


What do you mean you're out of fucks?! One of us has to care if Tris lives or dies!
The Ending:Okay, lots of spoilers here, folks. Spoilers all around from this point on.I didn't like the ending. I felt cheated because I had hung on for the ending. Everyone said how it made up for the rest of the book and what not, but here's the thing: The ending couldn't make up for all the angst-filled fluff the rest of the book was stuffed with. I didn't feel the anticipation throughout the novel and I hate to admit that I was really tempted to skim. The villan was killed really fast without much of a fight. I always hate when that happens. The villan has been giving the characters hell all throughout the story and by the time their number is up, they beg for their life and die by a simple stab wound?""Yes, if you kill me you'll never find the information!""*stabby stab*>insert blood and stuff<""UGH! I'M MELTING!""*dies*


Still no fucks I see. That's cold, bro.
And the big secret wasn't anything you couldn't have guessed from Divergent. It's revealed that the world is in chaos outside of the fence. Murders, destruction, etc. The weird thing is that I actually forgot about their society being enclosed in the fence until it was brought up near the end. It totally slipped my mind. But, I digress. The entire point of their society was to be a fresh start to the world. Somehow by boxing people in these Factions and waiting for the Divergent to emerge that equates to saving humanity. I'm not exactly sure how that works since the book just ends with that revelation and the Acknowledgements rolled. But I feel like Roth wrote herself all the way to a deserted island, sent up her S.O.S. signal and that cliffhanger fell right out of the sky to the rescue. *sigh* I really hate cliffhangers. It was one of the things that I liked about Divergent. For the most part things were tied up, but with Insurgent? It's quite the mess we'll be walking into in book three.Will I read the next book? Yes, because I've come this far and I'm hoping I will enjoy book three as much as I enjoyed Divergent. I think Insurgent suffers from ""Second Book Syndrome"" and the infamous ""Hype Train,"" may it die in a fire (the Hype Train, not the book). But ultimately, I'm interested in how Roth will explain away everything. Maybe then this whole series will make perfect logical sense to me. Until then, drink time, Spock?More reviews and shenanigans at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.",2.0
601,The Lightning Thief,Fantasy,"Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found herePercy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friends—one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena - Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.","Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.”
As someone who has worked in Los Angeles, I can tell you that this is completely accurate.While Harry Potter was spending his summers at the Dursleys, Percy Jackson attended Camp Half-Blood. This book has done the impossible: it has redeemed the name of Percy.Yes, that's right, that snot-faced, lily-livered waste of air of the very same name from the Harry Potter universe. That name is now relegated to the ranks of ""acceptable,"" because of my love for this book.Perseus (Percy) Jackson is the kind of kid with whom you can't help sympathizing. He is the type that's born under a dark star, because inevitably, wherever he goes, whatever he does, however good his intentions, he can't help but fuck everything up. Everything that can, does and will go wrong. A simple field trip can turn into a disaster in seconds.Jay-Z's got 99 problems, Percy might have more. He nearly flunks all his classes, he's got dyslexia, he's got ADHD, and then there's Nancy Bobofit.
Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap.“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos.
Nancy Bobofit is not a major character in the book. I have to mention her because her character resounded with me. I had my own Nancy Bobofit back in grade school, only her name is Mimi. Nearly 2 decades later, the memory of her horrible face still makes me shudder. But I digress.As if the bullies aren't bad enough, his dad is a no-show, his stepfather is LITERALLY named Ugli, and there are crones foretelling Percy's death as well as a minotaur chasing his ass around. AND NOBODY'S TELLING HIM A SINGLE FUCKING THING. What's with all the secrecy, man?As it turned out, Percy is *whispers* special. He is a half-blood, meaning one of his parents is a Greek deity. He gets sent to Camp Half-Blood, with roughly 100 other kids like him.It's a freaky place for a kid who's known nothing but relative normalcy his entire life. All of a sudden, he's playing Pinochle with a Greek God (Dionysus---what a drunk), his best friend Grover turns out to be a satyr, and the gorgeous blond girl who rescues him thinks he's a doofus and she keeps calling him ""seaweed brain.""To be fair, Percy had it coming. He is kind of a seaweed brain.
""Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.”“They must really like olives.”“Oh, forget it.”“Now, if she’d invented pizza—that I could understand.”“I said, forget it!”
Not your best moment, Percy.As it turned out, Percy IS special. His dad is one of the Big Three gods. Which kind of sucks, because that's not supposed to happen.
“About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful.""
A lot of people would think it was pretty cool to have such a powerful dad...not really.
Now that I was declared a son of one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive.
Not only does Percy have to struggle to fit in at Camp Half-Blood, but there's some shit going on in Mount Olympus. The gods are fighting again (when are they not)...
""During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea always liked you best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera.""
...and consequently, like a brother playing a prank on his younger siblings, someone's stuff was stolen. And Zeus thinks that his bro, Poseidon, put Percy up to it.Of course, blame the poor kid. Now Percy is shit out of luck YET AGAIN, and he's got no choice but to go on this huge stupid quest into the underworld (Los Angeles, ha!) to clear his name.He's not alone, he's accompanied by the snarky, gorgeous, fiercely competent Annabeth (she of the seaweed brain name-calling), as well as the most incompetent satyr that ever lived.
In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff’s “So Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.
It's going to be a loooooooong trip to the Underworld.The Setting: THIS. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GREEK MYTHOLOGY. I am a Greek mythology buff. I FUCKING LOVED THIS BOOK. This book is just absolutely fucking perfect in every way when it comes to rewriting and reinterpreting the Greek pantheon. It is so hilariously, awesomely irreverent, but completely fitting. The gods are reimagined, but they stay true to their true nature, and the myths are retold in a cheeky, flippant manner that had me giggling my ass off. This book is so fantastically snarky to the Greek gods. Everything is incredibly well-explained to a lay audience, like how the Greek gods can't seem to keep it in their pants.
Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”“That’s...crazy.”“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the last few millennia?”
And apparently, the habit runs true for both male and female goddesses.
“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?”
The existence of Greek gods and goddesses themselves are well explained, and believable.
“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just an abstract concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are part of it.""""Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods.""
I had my doubts about the execution of the premise of Greek mythology, and all my doubts have been destroyed. his book does great justice to the Greek gods, it is the most faithful rendition than I have ever read.The Characters: Yes, Percy is a special snowflake, but HELL, I LOVED THE LITTLE SHIT. He's got a special destiny. He is a special child. I DON'T CARE. Percy is such a sympathetic character, and although he won't be replacing Harry Potter in my heart any time soon, there is a special spot for him. He can give up pretty fast. He's kind of a wimp, but you know, finding out that you're a hald-blooded demigod is kind of a big deal, and I understand his attitude of ""GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.""
I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back.“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.”“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go home now.”
He doesn't really want to do anything big. He's pretty stupid sometimes (Auntie Em, geez), he's not exactly heroic. He only does the heroic shit when there are no other options.
“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.”
I loved Annabeth, she is all I could want from a female supporting character. I can't say that I'm fond of Grover...but I can't help feeling that we'll be seeing more of him in the future.
“But a quest to . . .” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.”
Overall: a fantastic book. A good middle grade book makes you feel like a child again, and this book did just the trick. I found myself giggling throughout the book, and an hour after reading it, there's still a smile on my face that can't be wiped off.",4.0
602,The Maze Runner,Young Adult,"If you ain’t scared, you ain’t human. When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his name. He’s surrounded by strangers—boys whose memories are also gone. Nice to meet ya, shank. Welcome to the Glade. Outside the towering stone walls that surround the Glade is a limitless, ever-changing maze. It’s the only way out—and no one’s ever made it through alive. Everything is going to change. Then a girl arrives. The first girl ever. And the message she delivers is terrifying. Remember. Survive. Run.","You know how sometimes you're running really fast from a horrible creature and, in a moment of panic, you turn around to see how close it is only to run straight into a brick wall?No?I don't know what that's like either. But that inattention to detail would probably totally screw you over because a.) now you're knocked unconscious and b.) the creature is going to devour you. Good job.I guess this is kind of like Lot's wife looking back on Sodom only to be turned into a pillar of salt. And it is also kind of like reading The Maze Runner. Stick with me. The first half of James Dashner's The Maze Runner maintains a superbly frantic pace. Thomas, our empty-shell-of-a-protagonist is thrust, via the Box, into a curious and unfriendly world populated by dozens of teenage boys. He remembers nothing, and the boys are uncooperative, refusing to reveal any details regarding their home, the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by stupendously tall walls, outside of which lays the Maze. During the day, the Maze is (kinda sorta) safe. But at night, the Grievers emerge. These are half slug/half woodshop tools that enjoy slicing and dicing apart anyone unfortunate to encounter them. They can also sting you, which causes much mayhem and requires the administering of Grief Serum, which triggers the Changing. SIDEBAR!What Is It With Authors Of Dystopian Novels Capitalizing Really Important Words? It's Annoying. Find A New Stylistic Approach That I Can Later Become Exasperated With.Anyway, Thomas' situation is bleak, made bleaker when a number of unfortunate coincidences causes him to bear witness to some truly awful acts of violence. Let's just say one untrustworthy soul is unwittingly tossed into the Maze at night and then a girl (not a boy!!!!!!!!) suspiciously arrives the day after Thomas. All of this, despite the Unnecessary Capitalization and the boys using completely pointless terminology like klunk and shuckface, is totally kitty fantastico. The constant psychological mystery keeps nagging doubts at bay and the variety of personalities that populate the Glade is totally believable. They talk like teenagers, they (generally) act like teenagers, and they form cliques and factions the way teenagers would. (From here on I'm covering up ""spoilers"", even though I think they're total nonsense and hilariously awful. And because I advise you not to read this book, you should click them. Just keeping the haters at bay.)Then Thomas spends a night in the Maze.And the book falls apart. For those of you paying attention, here's where the running into a brick wall metaphor arrives full gale.Dashner, whose prose has heretofore been mediocre but serviceable, completely fails his audience. He writes himself into a corner. He knows it, we know it. Thomas, who has always been slightly unlikeable and jerky becomes even more unlikeable and jerky, and the plot holes start opening up like the really bad similes peppered throughout the narrative. How does Dashner patch them up? Telepathy! Seriously. Telepathy! Yup. The girl who mysteriously appeared communicates with Thomas with her mind and tells him all sorts of shit that's supposed to clear everything up. It doesn't. It just creates a frustrating deus ex machina that could have been avoided, but isn't.As Thomas's character stumbles upon more and more unbelievable clues, like the moving walls of the maze actually form patterns of letters (that Thomas will eventually and conveniently know what to do with after experiencing the Changing himself), the book loses its momentum significantly. In fact, despite tearing through the first half of the book, I had to put it down. Afterwards, every time I looked at that stupid green cover, I found myself filled with dread - knowing full well that what remained would irritate me. And it did.Sometimes when the first book of a trilogy ends on a cliffhanger, I feel compelled to continue. I don't care what happens to Thomas and the rest of the characters. Maybe they'll smoke lots of pot, form a commune, and grow daisies. Maybe they'll turn into Grievers. Maybe they'll run into Katniss and Peeta and become BFFs. But I will let you, gentle reader, find that out for yourself.",2.0
603,Allegiant,Young Adult,"So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.","Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case of Allegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will be MASSIVE SPOILERS for all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate1. The World BuildingWhen you think about both Divergent and Insurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions in Divergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. In Insurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end of Insurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get to Allegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end of Insurgent was for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there's not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it. As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way in Insurgent and she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her. Those mistakes made Tris human. But in Allegiant? she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is. c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory. His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn't find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling. After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all of Allegiant being broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. In Insurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. In Allegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect. The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and the deus ex machina moments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can't wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.	Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that's fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son. ...what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris's growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it. First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb's redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an accessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not? I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing? She was running into her mother’s arms and asking if she could be finished. Wanting to be done, implying a choice, even though she JUST told Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn’t want to leave him. If she’d gone down fighting, I’d have bought this more. But she seemed to welcome death - to want it - and that reverts her straight back to the things she supposedly learned she DIDN’T want in InsurgentI don’t understand why Tris’s death did anything to make that message more real. If anything it makes it less so. It’s easy to band together in grief - to find the people who understand and cling to them and form a stronger bond while you do. We saw that already with Christina and Uriah. I think this book wouldn’t have been able to gloss over everything if Tris had lived. Like Uriah’s injury and demise, a lot of this ending was hurriedly tied up with her death. We didn’t have to see what really happened in the aftermath. We didn’t have to deal with the choices for society. Tris’s death was sand for the characters to bury their heads in. This book didn't have a hopeful ending because nothing really changed. 90% of the characters are dead and everyone forgives everyone almost everything because they care about them? This is the foundation of rebuilding and stability upon which these characters and this world can grow? I’d have given up Tris (and Tris and Four) if it left Four and the the people she cared about with strength and hope and a better world, but I didn’t see that it did.  Things that Worked for me in Allegiant, a list by Kate1. There was a lot of making out.2. Though I wanted more from the ending, Four's pain was certainly poignant.",2.0
604,Throne of Glass,Young Adult,"An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released from prison to serve as the king's champion. Her name is Celaena Sardothien. The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. But something evil dwells in the castle of glass—and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.","Are you kidding me? What the hell is this shit? How do you screw up your story quite so badly after starting from an INCREDIBLE premise involving the most notorious assassin in the land - now a slave - being offered the chance to win back her freedom, sort of, in a ""to-the-death tournament - fighting the most gifted thieves and assassins in the land"" [says the back of my book, conveniently forgetting that (a) right before the final duels, the king specifically states that the competitors ""can win only by trapping [their] opponent[s] in a position of sure death ... and no further"" so to-the-death my foot, and (b) apart from thieves and assassins, a number of the competitors are actually ex-guards and random other criminals, for the most part disposable enough not to warrant names, and I'd only consider a small handful of them to be gifted at anything]? I mean, you really have to be TALENTED to go from all of *that* Exciting Sounding Awesomeness to - well - to Throne of Glass.After reading the Q & A included in the back of my book, though, it all started to make sense, and I wish I'd known before buying this stupid-ass book that it's inspired by DISNEY'S CINDERELLA, of all things. I know what you're thinking: Where the fridge tart does Cinderella come in? Isn't this story about, like, a TOUGH-AS-NAILS former-assassin-now-slave competing for her life in, like, the most badass tournament ever? Well ... actually, no. And I'm happy to spend the next few hours of my life quoting this most dumbass book if it means AT LEAST ONE PERSON might decide not to waste their money on it, no need to thank me.'""Wake up."" Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.She shimmied beneath the blankets, pulling them over her head, but he grabbed the covers and threw them to the floor. Her nightgown was wrapped around her thighs. Celaena shivered.""It's cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions - she needed sleep. [Nope, this isn't your bratty kid sister, but the most notorious assassin EVAH! You know, the one who - after slaving away in the salt mines for four months - was so desperate to escape that she even tried a mad suicide dash. What the hell, though; they're only offering her her freedom.] It would have been nice if the Crown Prince had considered springing her from Endovier earlier so she could have some time to regain her strength; how long had he known about this competition, anyway? [Sheesh. I know, right? Silly Crown Prince, not considering the feelings of, like, one of the most terrible criminals his men have ever captured. I mean, he gives you large, comfortable living quarters in his castle, a billiards table, a chance to change your life, even a puppy, and - what - he thinks this is enough?!] ""Get up."" Chaol ripped the pillows from beneath her head. ""Now you're wasting my time."" If he noticed how much skin she was showing, he didn't react. [That wasn't irrelevant at all ... ]Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor. ""Fetch my slippers,"" she mumbled. ""The floor's like ice."" [Yeah, put those servants in their place, Cinderella!]...From the doorway, Chaol asked, ""Why, might I ask, are you so tired?""She gulped down the rest of the pomegranate juice and wiped her mouth on a napkin. ""I was up until four reading,"" she said.' [Why do you even have to ask, Chaol? It's only the start of the tournament of Celaena's life; of course she stayed up all night reading. SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YO!! If the competition barely merits any page time, why should the competitors actually give a shit about it?!]'A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""' [Way to be descriptive, Cinderella! Generic complaints FTW! It's not like you've been slaving in the salt mines for a year, or anything like that, OF COURSE YOUR CLOTHES MATTER and HOW DARE THEY?! DON'T LET THE BASTARDS GRIND YOU DOWN!!?!!?!!]'""You expect me to use a mace an hour after sunrise?""' [The horror!]'She bit into an apple. It was tart, with a sweet, honey-like aftertaste. ""Oh? And what books do you love?"" He named a few, and she blinked. ""Well, those are good choices - for the most part. What others?"" she asked, and somehow, an hour flew by, carrying them on the wings of conversation.' [Jesus. This paragraph isn't a pointless waste of space at all.]'There was something girlish about her, too. Oh, he couldn't stand her contradictions!' [INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS!!! Because *my* Chaol doesn't have a va-jay-jay ... ]'Celaena bit down her laugh. Archery? It was an archery contest?' [Yeah, that was my reaction, too ... ]'Pelor, the gangly assassin, wasn't yet strong enough to manage a longbow, and barely made any shots. When he finished, his eyes gleaming with resentment, the Champions sniggered, and Cain laughed the loudest....Despite herself, Celaena felt badly for the boy. His shots hadn't been that bad.' [Yeesh! If barely making any shots isn't *that* bad, I can see how CINDERBRAT is the world's scariest assassin.]'""Why would she kill me? I think she likes being pampered. [*snort*] If she hasn't attempted to escape or kill anyone, then why would she do it now?"" He patted his friend on the shoulder. ""You worry too much.""' [ZOMG! U NVR HERD OF BIDING UR TIME B4? This Crown Prince is clearly not the brightest crayon in the box.]'Sam. What would he make of all this?' [Since he's never been mentioned before, I really can't say. Sorry.]'Dorian peeled himself from the wall. For all her assassinating experience, she didn't notice him until he sat down on the bench beside her.' [Yeah, I can see why she's Most Baddest Assassinator EVAH! And who glued you to the wall, anyway, Crown Douche Bag?]'""No. I can survive well enough on my own - if given proper reading material.""He looked at the fire, trying not to think about where she'd been only weeks before - and what that kind of loneliness might have felt like. There were no books in Endovier.' [I find it hard to believe that loneliness is your biggest problem when you're a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl slaving away in a salt mine, but ... what do I know? A BOOK!! A BOOK!! MY KINGDOM FOR A BOOK!!!!]'It wasn't until later that Philippa brought the news. The Champion who hadn't shown up for the Test had been found dead in a servant's stairwell, brutally mauled and dismembered.The new murder cast a pall over the next two weeks, and the two Tests they brought with them. Celaena passed the Tests - stealth and tracking - without drawing much attention to herself or risking her neck to save anyone.' [When your plot's so boring that you're summarizing it all, you've got a problem ... ]'He remained in the doorway, fearful that she'd wake up if he took another step. Some assassin. She hadn't even bothered to stir.' [I know, right? Also, you're a stalking stalker, Crown Douche Bag!]'She smiled at the young chevaliers they passed - and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn't blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it.' [Bloody hell, you'd think a year of slavery would knock the vanity right out of a girl ... ]'The assassin pivoted around the table and took aim again. She missed. Gritting her teeth, she considered snapping the cue in half across her knee. But she'd been attempting to play for only an hour. She'd be incredible by midnight! She'd master this ridiculous game or she'd turn the table into firewood.' [Now, now, CINDERBRAT. Temper tantrums are, like, so unbecoming.]'""For the world's greatest assassin, this is pathetic,"" said Dorian, stepping from the doorway.' [Because assassins are widely known to be proficient at billiards. What, you didn't know??]'She had often wished for adventure.' [If you spend seven years as an assassin and somehow manage not to stumble headfirst into all sorts of adventures, you're probably not doing it right.]'So she'd cheated a little, but she'd won.' [LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS; WE'VE JUST HAD OUR FIRST GLIMPSE OF CELAENA ACTUALLY BEHAVING REMOTELY LIKE AN ASSASSIN!!!! And it's only page 240 ... ]'It had been over three weeks since her last encounter with Elena, and she hadn't seen or heard her at all, despite the three Tests she'd had, the most exciting of which being an obstacle course, which she passed with only a few minor scratches and bruises. Unfortunately, Pelor hadn't done so well, and had been sent home at long last. But he'd been lucky: three other competitors had died. All found in forgotten [well, obviously not that forgotten] hallways; all mutilated beyond recognition.' [The plot overload! It's ... it's ... positively ... unbearable ... ]'Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment - though she couldn't say the same for the soldier who'd been sent home - and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.' [WOW: So Much Story! How can I process it all?]'""Candy!"" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how she adored candy!Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth....""Someone,"" she said in between chews, ""is very good to me.""' [I just ... oh God ... I have no words! :D Cookie Monster strikes again?]'""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shoes and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over and whatever it is that dogs do. And I want her to run - run with the other dogs when they're practicing. I want her to put those long legs to use.""Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog. ""That's a long list of demands. Perhaps I should have bought you jewelry after all."" [Hold your puppies, Dorian, CINDERDIVA STILL isn't done.]""When I'm training"" - she kissed the pup's soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena's neck - ""I want her in the kennels, training as well. When I return in the afternoon, she may be brought to me. I'll keep her in the night."" Celaena held the dog at eye level. The dog kicked her legs in the air. ""If you ruin any of my shoes,"" she said to the pup, ""I'll turn you into a pair of slippers. Understood?""' [Jesus Christ. Is it bad that what *I* want is for someone to rend Celaena limb from limb? And why does she have a bunch of shoes, anyway? Am I the only one who remembers that she's a fucking FORMER-ASSASSIN-NOW-SLAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!]'Philippa huffed. ""Just don't tell them I helped you when you get dragged back here.""' [Sure, because if Celaena says nothing, they'll probably assume it was one of her other, non-existent maids who helped her navigate her way into her dress.]'Frowning, Chaol watched his friend dance with the assassin. He wouldn't have danced with her, anyway. And he was glad he hadn't worked up the nerve to ask her, not after seeing the color that Duke Perrington's face turned upon discovering the pair.' [WTF is the author Chaol talking about? What actually happens five minutes prior to this is that Celaena asks him to dance and he says no. Also, this guy's kind of a wussy-with-a-""p"" for a Captain of the Guard. He's never even killed anyone before. Yeesh. Captain of the Guard, my foot.]' ... Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king ... ' [That's what they keep saying, but the king isn't even present in the castle for the majority of the competition, so ... ]Oh, one more thing: THE NAMES! How the heck do you pronounce Chaol? Kale? Like the cabbage? And Kaltain Rompier has to be one of the stupidest names I've EVER come across. It makes me think of frolicking unicorns, or ... something. As for the main character, well, I don't even know what to call her. Selena? Kay-lay-na? (that's the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don't even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I'll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle? Or the non-existent throne of glass that the book's apparently named after? Thinly-veiled CINDERELLA references FTW!!!! If you ask me, the author should have gone for Cinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don't get much more than that. I don't even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don't know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you'd otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses, Cinderella Celaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high. It's ... exciting stuff. Really.Also, since when do slaves have possessions? Why does some random slave (who immediately gets murdered by some random people, so yay for the Drama Llama) have enough salve to pass around as required? Who makes this salve? From what? Who are these slaves allowed to associate with that they can procure salve? What do they trade for this salve? Their bodies? Their hair? Salt they've squirrelled away from the mines? Yeesh! Explain yourself, Sarah J. Maas!UGH! Terrible, terrible, horrendous. Nonsensical, stupid, pointless. Fluffy, pathetic, ridiculous. Need I say more? Really? Need I? Throne of Glass tries to emulate Poison Study ... and fails ... spectacularly. Save yourself the torture and go straight for Poison Study. If you've already read Posion Study, read it again. Or try Graceling. Just ... don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0

I've read far better action scenes from guys like John Sandford who actually write thrillers that have plots that hang together and don't trot out every action movie cliche in the process. Plus, there are massive gaps in logic. A murder victim turns out to be a federal agent who is working on a super-secret case that is so important that it literally threatens the United States. Yet, after he's killed and it's reported, nobody else from the government even shows up to check it out. WTF? I can gloss over unrealistic procedural stuff in the interest of a good story, but since this isn't a good story, the plot loopholes are too horrible to ignore.Another problem is that Child couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write just an action novel or a detective story, and he tried to split the difference. Not good. Reacher is the worst fictional detective I've ever read. Giant clues are put in front of him that anyone who has ever read a book or seen an episode of television since 1962 would instantly recognize, but he misses them. Yet, when called for, he can make ludicrous leaps of intuition that would make Sherlock Holmes scratch his head at the sheer implausibility of them. This might have been a better book if Reacher was just a revenge driven killing machine mowing through the bad guys without the pretense of playing detective.This would have been 1 star, but I gave it an extra star because the main piece of the criminal plot is actually kind of clever and not something I'd read before. Unfortunately, it's the only original thing in this book.** Update 4/10/16 - I recently read another crime novel that used an identical idea of  bleaching $1 bills to use for counterfeiting purposes. Since that book was published 36 years before this one it seems a lot less original then I initially thought so I took away that second star.",1.0

My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now!

And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0

We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",5.0
609,The Alchemist,Fiction,"Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
610,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Self Help,"When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life","This book explains 7 principles that make a person more effective personally and professionally. Covey shows how a principle-centered, character-based life helps you build the healthy relationships that are key to an effective life. This classic is well worth reading for its perspective and practical advice.ConceptsCorrect Principles: Covey frequently references his Christianity. He says the Habits are based on ""Correct Principles"" (aka Natural Law) found in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and common to major religions.P/PC Balance: Covey says you must maintain a balance between production (P; your output) and production capability (PC; your ability to produce). You must stay healthy and renew yourself (see Habit 7) or you'll get burned out and become ineffective. He uses the fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg as a metaphor.Interdependence: Covey says the Habits lead you from dependence to independence to interdependence (cooperating with others to achieve a common goal; producing things greater than the sum of their parts).The 7 HabitsHabit 1: Be ProactiveYou choose how to respond to what life throws at you. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom to choose. Take responsibility for your actions.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind Choose your short-term, daily behavior according to the plan you have for your entire life. Think about the legacy you want to leave. Put things in perspective; what would you want people to say at your funeral?Habit 3: Put First Things FirstDaily planning is too narrow and short-sighted. Weekly planning gives a better big-picture perspective of your goals, and allows for the flexibility to deal with the things that will inevitably come up.People are more important than things, so plan your time accordingly. Be efficient with things, but effective with people. You can't be efficient with relationships; they take time. Instead of focusing on things and time, focus on relationships and results.Only spend time on things that align with your deep values. Don't waste time on other things, even if it means saying no to requests. Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.Think of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Focus on the important, even though they seem less urgent. Think preventatively to keep tasks from ever becoming urgent.Use stewardship delegation instead of ""gofer"" delegation; teach a person to be the steward of the task you assign to them, rather than constantly telling them to ""go for this"" or ""go for that.""Habit 4: Think Win/WinMost of life requires cooperation, not competition. Work together with co-workers, friends, and family for mutual benefit. Approach everything in terms of ""win/win or no deal""; if you can't reach a deal in which both parties feel they're winning, don't make a deal at all. Create win/win agreements that clearly state expectations, privileges, consequences up front. This prevents you from having to figure those things out when issues arise, and makes the relationship more smooth because it causes each person to manage themselves.Think in terms of the Abundance Mentality rather than the Scarcity Mentality; the quest for recognition, credit, power, and profit isn't a zero-sum game. Be happy when others succeed.Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be UnderstoodListen with the intent to understand, not to reply. Diagnose before you prescribe. Understand needs, concerns, situation before you give advice.To understand others, listen with empathy. To be understood, present your views according to:• ethos: personal credibility• pathos: emotional alignment with the other person• logos: logical reasoningYou can't motivate people by appealing to satisfied needs (money, status, etc.); only unsatisfied needs motivate.Habit 6: Synergize.Value the differences in relationships. Oneness is not sameness, it's complementariness. Unity is not uniformity.Habit 7: Sharpen the SawRenew and improve in yourself in the following categories, by spending at least an hour on each category daily.• Physical: Eat right and exercise.• Spiritual: Find and carry an inner peace. Meditate, read Scripture, or spend time in nature.• Mental: Read good literature to gain the insights of others. Write, organize, and plan.• Social/emotional: Understand others. Serve others, at work or through volunteering.AfterwardCovey says a summary of the first 3 Habits is ""make and keep a promise,"" and a summary of the next 3 Habits is ""involve others in the problem and work out the solution together."" He says the first 3 Habits are about integrity, and the next 3 are about loyalty.",4.0
611,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,Nonfiction,"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.",3.0

613,How to Win Friends and Influence People,Self Help,"You can go after the job you want...and get it! You can take the job you have...and improve it! You can take any situation you're in...and make it work for you!Since its release in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People has sold more than 30 million copies. Dale Carnegie's first book is a timeless bestseller, packed with rock-solid advice that has carried thousands of now famous people up the ladder of success in their business and personal lives.As relevant as ever before, Dale Carnegie's principles endure, and will help you achieve your maximum potential in the complex and competitive modern age.Learn the six ways to make people like you, the twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking, and the nine ways to change people without arousing resentment.","This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review.",2.0
615,Think and Grow Rich,Business,"Think and Grow Rich is a guide to success by Napoleon Hill, which was first published in 1937 following the Great Depression. It was immediately welcomed as an antidote to hard times and remained a bestseller for decades. Many people still find its philosophy of positive thinking and its specific steps for achieving wealth both relevant and life-changing. Hill contends that our thoughts become our reality, and offers a plan and principles for transforming thoughts into riches, including visualization, affirmation, creating a Master Mind group, defining a goal, and planning.","Let's be honest to ourselves and face the truth: success in business depends on a complex equation with a lot of variants, such as 1) how well your business idea adapts to the powers of supply and demand, which govern (and oppress) contemporary society, 2) where you come from economically to begin with (I've seen aromatherapy businesses run by middle-class sons of bitches grow and be more ""successful"" than neighborhood food establishments run by poor honest people), 3) how much investing capital you have at the time of creating your business, 4) your race, and 5) sheer dumb luck. Quotes like “The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat” are ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous and delve into the worst kind of new-agey, self-help bullshitting bullying: victim-blaming. So, if your business is not successful, you are to blame, because you simply failed to desire it enough? Fuck that shit. This book is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in today's first-world-white-heterosexual-male-dominated economic culture. Tell me that such ideas as ""desiring it enough"" would work in Somalia, hell, even in Egypt, and then we'll talk. Don't waste your time with this codswallop.

616,The Secret,Self Help,"The worldwide bestselling phenomenon that has helped millions tap the power of the law that governs all our lives to create—intentionally and effortlessly—a joyful life.In 2006, a groundbreaking feature-length film revealed the great mystery of the universe—The Secret—and, later that year, Rhonda Byrne followed with a book that became a worldwide bestseller.Fragments of a Great Secret have been found in the oral traditions, in literature, in religions, and philosophies throughout the centuries. For the first time, all the pieces of The Secret come together in an incredible revelation that will be life-transforming for all who experience it.In this book, you’ll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life—money, health, relationships, happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world. You’ll begin to understand the hidden, untapped power that’s within you, and this revelation can bring joy to every aspect of your life.The Secret contains wisdom from modern-day teachers—men and women who have used it to achieve health, wealth, and happiness. By applying the knowledge of The Secret, they bring to light compelling stories of eradicating disease, acquiring massive wealth, overcoming obstacles, and achieving what many would regard as impossible.","this website is too kind. one star means ""didn't like it"". I hate, hate, hate this book with absolute passion. sorry if you like oprah but she seriously did the world a disservice by recommending this book. apparently there is a dvd also that i don't even think i could stomach. so here's the concept behind ""The Secret"". You can attract good things to you through your good thoughts. Ok, I'm on board with that. It has worked for me. Ooh, I already knew the Secret! too bad I didn't use it to make millions like this chick! But no, it goes further. You attract bad things to you through your negative thoughts. Well, negative thoughts are pretty useless, so I can see benefit in trying to decrease or eliminate them. And one time (true story) I did get robbed while traveling after worrying about it for 3 weeks. BUT. There is no gray area with this one. According to the author, people who are raped, killed, maimed, tortured - they all bring it on themselves with their negative thoughts. The people in Darfur should be thinking ""here comes the food, there go the guns"". The book goes on to say that weight management is simply a matter of ""thinking thin"" and not looking at fat people (for real), that if you have a stack of bills to pay you should instead picture checks coming in, that you can have everything you want through visualization, such as your hands on the steering wheel of your car, and that you can cure your cancer watching funny movies. There is a weak chapter at the end about how you can use your Secret powers for the common good, like world peace, but why would you want to waste it when you can be driving your new Hummer? I would go so far as to say that this book is not only BAD but it is DANGEROUS. It promotes the self-absorbed, materialistic, shallow outlook of predominantly rich white people to the exclusion of the rest of the planet - while managing to blame them for their problems and justify those in possession of the Secret for not using their visualized wealth to promote social change. Aah, brilliant. genius. avoid this book. do not give money to this woman and her brilliant marketing pyramid!",1.0
617,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",Business,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his ""rich dad"" — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.","I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting ""This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!"" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book. Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages: * When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses. * Try to own things that put money in your pocket. * If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money. There you go. That's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics. Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she hasn't been ""discovered"" yet. He tells her to take courses in marketing, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to market them. I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I'd feel for responding to a ""get rich quick"" spam mail.",1.0
618,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,Self Help,"But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him ""The Fittest (Real) Man in America.""In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.","I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, it's an inspiring story of a man who has overcome a lifetime of struggle and proved that you can do anything if you're willing to push yourself. In the first half of the book especially this was a message that resonated with me and made me think about David Goggins as a man to look up to. On the other hand, it's a cautionary tale of a man who is so stubborn he can not learn from his past mistakes. He is constantly going into situations underprepared and then pushing his body past the point of sanity in order to accomplish a goal and seemingly expecting applause for that. Were he in some life or death situation then I might just give him said applause, but instead, he is always just trying to prove something to himself which is a really unhealthy way to go through life. Overall there were two main lessons to take from Mr Goggins story. One is that if you really put your mind to a task you can achieve the impossible. The second is that there is nothing admirable about taking the path of highest resistance just for the sake of personal pride. Yes, Mr Goggins has achieved amazing things, but there are others who have achieved similar results in a more intelligent and healthy way. In the end, I came in exactly on the halfway mark in regards to how I felt about this book and I have rounded up for the sake of not wanting to give this book a 2-star review. One final note is a comment on the audiobook. Mr Goggins made the decision to insert multiple interludes that feature the narrator interviewing him. These were interesting at first but soon grew really tiresome. They felt really self-serving as each one went along the lines of the narrator expressing how in awe of David Goggins he was, and David Goggins expressing yet again how hard it was for him to achieve his goals.

I can sum up this book pretty quickly. If you want to make a change in your life, or if you are not happy with your life, you are the only one who can make it better. There were a few things that really bothered me. If you are depressed, you cannot simply decide that you are not going to be depressed anymore and get yourself out and have fun. It is apparent that the author has never experienced depression, or been a very sympathetic friend to anyone she knows who has been depressed. I also feel that some of her advice is not very practical in the real world. So if I'm a single mom supporting 4-5 kids, and I've always dreamed of starting my own business, I should just quit my job? I should buy expensive things, that I might not be able to pay for? There is some good advice on stopping negative thoughts, but some of the examples of going for what you really want are just not practical for most people.",1.0
620,The Last Lecture,Nonfiction,"A lot of professors give talks titled 'The Last Lecture'. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.","I sat down to write my review of “The Last Lecture” on Friday July 25th. Before I started to write, I decided to check Randy Pausch's website for any updates on his condition. He had died that morning at the age of 47. The book, and the lecture itself, now take on new meaning.For those who aren't aware, Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students. What would you say? What wisdom would you impart? What are your lessons in life? For Randy, this was not a hypothetical question. Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced “the elephant in the room”: advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months. With this revelation out of the way, he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others. The lecture was so full of optimism, clarity, hope, humour, and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book. “The Last Lecture” contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture, plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experience.Like the lecture, the book is earnest and straightforward. Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it. He fills his stories with humour, occasionally laugh out loud. What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind. It's hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author. He seems like a great guy, someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend. I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success; his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words. This still comes across in the book, although not as strongly as in the lecture. In fact, without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words, reading the book can almost get a bit tiring. I recall thinking on a number of occasions: “Ok, we know that you're a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up, you don't need to keep telling me”. Some of the advice in the book, especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture, can be a bit tough to swallow. For example, his advice to always carry 200$ in cash in your wallet; does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book? Similarly, he often speaks of the great mentors, friends, and supporters that he has had through his life; not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their student's careers. Finally, his advice to never give up (“Brick walls are not there to keep us out, they are there so we can show how much we want something”) sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement. He never says to expect something for nothing, but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it. Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge. Fortunately these moments are fairly rare, and as long as you don't read the book in a single sitting (which is quite possible) then you probably won't feel too overwhelmed.Interestingly, shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture. What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far? It is quite a difficult question to answer. I'm sure that I don't have the life experience to give a good enough answer, but it's quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response. I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book. We need people like Randy, who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it. Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice, what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in, and that he thought others would benefit from hearing. His life, lecture, book, and his death remind me of a quote from Dr. Howard Thurman: ""Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive”. Even as he lived the last few months of his life, I know that Randy was truly alive.",3.0
621,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Nonfiction,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail.",2.0

With unflinching faith and tenacity, Hollis spurs other women to live with passion and hustle and to awaken their slumbering goals.","Some parts of this book spoke to me (yes, I can be better at showing up for myself), and others made me want to throw the book across the room and scream. I struggled with every word she said about diet and body image—what was meant to be uplifting and inspiring was preached as scientific fact from someone with no medical/dietetic credentials. She had nothing to back up her claims, but she preached it like doctrine. I also really struggled with the story of how she met her husband. She says that people may have issue with her sharing it and that it isn’t meant for it to be used to condone an unhealthy relationship. But....she married the man from her super unhealthy relationship. Guys, don’t marry the guy who “brings you to bars and ignores you while he hits on other women.” Don’t marry the guy who “only calls you at night when he’s been drinking but ignores you during the day.” Don’t marry the guy who you “give your virginity to because you don’t know how else to keep him interested.” I mean, really. She gave so much time to how terrible their first year was and then gives a quick “but now everything is great!” And it just doesn’t work for me.I think the point of the husband story was that when she told him she needed to be respected and she didn't want him calling anymore, he realized she was worth respecting. She had to respect herself to get respect, yada yada. Buuuutttt telling someone you don't want them to contact you anymore and then having them show up on your doorstep the next morning is literally the opposite of respect. I love it when I set boundaries and people totally ignore them—romance! Edit: I have to come back and discuss more things that are not okay. The diet pills? She essentially tells everyone that she and her roommate survived off of diet pills to the point that they were hallucinating, so they stopped taking them and gained back 40 lbs. She doesn’t discourage this, if anything the quick “oh and then we gained weight and became less attractive” seems like a subtle “I can’t recommend this BUT if you want to lose weight here’s how to do it.” Sooo not okay. Additionally, when people come to her her diet advice (why is she giving diet advice? Is she a dietician? Does she have any medical knowledge?) she tells them to start by drinking more water, and when they’ve mastered that start cutting out foods. Here’s an idea: listen to your body!! Thin =/= worthy/good/important.Another edit: I was on a plane with my young exhausted kids today and was thinking how an outsider would totally judge my parenting skills, but I gotta do what I gotta do and my in-flight parenting techniques are totally different from day-to-day. Then I remembered how Rachel went off on the totally exhausted mom for giving her kid candy on a plane. Maybe there was more to it that I’m not remembering? But honestly, anyone who has flown with their kids knows the struggle is real.",1.0
