0,Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,,4.36,"['October', '16,', '2018']","A Book That Changed My LifeA book worth reading once a year. In 2023, my goal is to consume less and create more. The stories in my heart and mind were finally going to meet paper. But I wasn’t actually writing anything. When the day started, I knew that I had to write. I wasn’t feeling very well so I would write later. Then, dinner would happen, and I was behind on my reading and didn’t feel any better than earlier in the day. Enter Atomic Habits. After reading the book, I took out my calendar and scheduled, “Writing,” from 1 pm to 1:20 pm. Now, I am actually writing.How many of us have goals: to have better relationships, to lose weight, to learn a language? We have the best of intentions, but we don’t have a plan with manageable actionable steps.Have you ever wondered how I got to be the #3 US Book Reviewer on GoodReads? Atomic Habits.Before reading Atomic Habits, I had what I now realize as wishful thinking or dreams. At times, sometimes I made it on to the top 100 book reviewers, but it was always a complete mystery to me. When I made the list, I couldn't believe my luck! I wanted to rate higher, but I had no real plan.Then, I read Atomic Habits. I sat down and had a clearly articulated goal. ""I want to rate X on the best reviewer list."" Okay. Sounds great. But what does that take? I looked at where I wanted to be on the weekly list and saw how many votes the reviewer received. I divided that number by 7 and knew that I needed to achieve that many votes per day to get to where I needed to be. Sure enough. I met my goal and started to become consistently ranked. Atomic Habits is all about shifting your dreams and wishful thinking into knowing exactly where you want to be and making a plan to get there.Also, it talks about lofty goals.Almost everybody can relate. We make lofty goals: I’m going to run a marathon! I’m going to write a book! I’m going to lose weight! After a few weeks of intense effort (if we make it that far), we give up and go back to the way things were.Did you know that I got back into reading by reading 6 books a year? That’s right. My goal was 6 books per year. The only reason that I initially picked up this book was that someone was RAVING about it, and I was extremely skeptical. I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of rah rah feel good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals. Little changes can make big differences over time. For example, when I lay out my sheet mask in the morning, I am much more likely to use it at night. This book made me want to write down goals for the year or at least start thinking of the things I wanted to make a priority. This is my second reading of Atomic Habits, and I read it as a buddy read (which I highly recommend). It is interesting to hear about other systems.During this read of Atomic Habits, I was struck by the idea of becoming 1% better.Growing up, I really enjoyed playing basketball. The game is fast-paced, and it was one game where I could actually score. However, I can’t jump very high. I was so fixated on this weak area that I convinced myself that I couldn’t be a basketball player.But you know what? I can sink three-pointers like nobody’s business. At Dave and Buster’s, I can easily achieve the high score. What if I didn’t give up? What if I spent my time trying to get better at running, aiming, teamwork, dribbling? As an overachiever, I do tend to obsess over my weak areas. I spend so much time on the weak area that I ignore some of my other talents. What would I achieve if I just accepted that I am not great in a particular area but focused my time on other areas? Would I enjoy the journey more?If you have tried losing weight or training, I would highly recommend this book. I can definitely see myself reading this once every year—it really is that good!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",5.0
1,The Alchemist,,3.91,"['January', '1,', '1988']","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
2,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,,4.16,"['January', '1,', '1989']","This book explains 7 principles that make a person more effective personally and professionally. Covey shows how a principle-centered, character-based life helps you build the healthy relationships that are key to an effective life. This classic is well worth reading for its perspective and practical advice.ConceptsCorrect Principles: Covey frequently references his Christianity. He says the Habits are based on ""Correct Principles"" (aka Natural Law) found in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and common to major religions.P/PC Balance: Covey says you must maintain a balance between production (P; your output) and production capability (PC; your ability to produce). You must stay healthy and renew yourself (see Habit 7) or you'll get burned out and become ineffective. He uses the fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg as a metaphor.Interdependence: Covey says the Habits lead you from dependence to independence to interdependence (cooperating with others to achieve a common goal; producing things greater than the sum of their parts).The 7 HabitsHabit 1: Be ProactiveYou choose how to respond to what life throws at you. Between stimulus and response lies your freedom to choose. Take responsibility for your actions.Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind Choose your short-term, daily behavior according to the plan you have for your entire life. Think about the legacy you want to leave. Put things in perspective; what would you want people to say at your funeral?Habit 3: Put First Things FirstDaily planning is too narrow and short-sighted. Weekly planning gives a better big-picture perspective of your goals, and allows for the flexibility to deal with the things that will inevitably come up.People are more important than things, so plan your time accordingly. Be efficient with things, but effective with people. You can't be efficient with relationships; they take time. Instead of focusing on things and time, focus on relationships and results.Only spend time on things that align with your deep values. Don't waste time on other things, even if it means saying no to requests. Don't prioritize your schedule; schedule your priorities.Think of tasks in terms of urgency and importance. Focus on the important, even though they seem less urgent. Think preventatively to keep tasks from ever becoming urgent.Use stewardship delegation instead of ""gofer"" delegation; teach a person to be the steward of the task you assign to them, rather than constantly telling them to ""go for this"" or ""go for that.""Habit 4: Think Win/WinMost of life requires cooperation, not competition. Work together with co-workers, friends, and family for mutual benefit. Approach everything in terms of ""win/win or no deal""; if you can't reach a deal in which both parties feel they're winning, don't make a deal at all. Create win/win agreements that clearly state expectations, privileges, consequences up front. This prevents you from having to figure those things out when issues arise, and makes the relationship more smooth because it causes each person to manage themselves.Think in terms of the Abundance Mentality rather than the Scarcity Mentality; the quest for recognition, credit, power, and profit isn't a zero-sum game. Be happy when others succeed.Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be UnderstoodListen with the intent to understand, not to reply. Diagnose before you prescribe. Understand needs, concerns, situation before you give advice.To understand others, listen with empathy. To be understood, present your views according to:• ethos: personal credibility• pathos: emotional alignment with the other person• logos: logical reasoningYou can't motivate people by appealing to satisfied needs (money, status, etc.); only unsatisfied needs motivate.Habit 6: Synergize.Value the differences in relationships. Oneness is not sameness, it's complementariness. Unity is not uniformity.Habit 7: Sharpen the SawRenew and improve in yourself in the following categories, by spending at least an hour on each category daily.• Physical: Eat right and exercise.• Spiritual: Find and carry an inner peace. Meditate, read Scripture, or spend time in nature.• Mental: Read good literature to gain the insights of others. Write, organize, and plan.• Social/emotional: Understand others. Serve others, at work or through volunteering.AfterwardCovey says a summary of the first 3 Habits is ""make and keep a promise,"" and a summary of the next 3 Habits is ""involve others in the problem and work out the solution together."" He says the first 3 Habits are about integrity, and the next 3 are about loyalty.",4.0
3,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,,3.89,"['January', '1,', '2016']","If you follow my reviews/blog at all, you probably already know that I am already a zero fucks given kind of gal when it comes to, well, bullshit.In fact, my best friend had the below picture as my contact photo in his phone for years.So it should come as no surprise that I, like many, was drawn to this book, 1) Because it has the word ""fuck"" in the title. Duh. And, 2) Because it's bright fucking orange. That said, the chum was in the water for me already based on that alone. But when I got to this:I knew this book and I would be friends. I am SO anti-participation trophy it's ridiculous. And, no, I don't care if that offends all the middle class helicopter moms and their special snowflakes. Your kid needs to learn how to lose.That's how character is built, my friends.And that's pretty much one of the major points in this book actually.That and, simply put, prioritizing where you put your emotional energy aka your fucks. Stuff I have a solid a handle on already. But, full transparency, I read this out of curiosity and with a slim to none expectation of there being anything life changing to take away from it.Don't get me wrong, color me surprised, I thought this book made a lot of solid points.Some really good, well articulated ones actually. I definitely do think this book has something to offer.For example, it reminded me that I need to stop hoping my sister and I form a BFF Sweet Valley High-esque sister friendship and accept the fact that we are 35+ fucking years old and it's just not gonna happen.And that's okay. She only texts me when she wants or needs something and, while we love and respect each other - we just aren't all THAT. And that's okay. As I said, it made good points - none of which the author attempted to claim creating - he just wrote it down in an easy, witty, sometimes offensive and conversational fashion with examples of his own life and personal epiphanies. It did get a little ridiculous sometimes with how much he referred to his former ""bangs all the ladies"" behavior. We get it, you are a walking dream machine. *eye roll*It also contradicted itself a bit in some areas, though nothing detrimental in my eyes. He also definitely walked a fine line when discussing certain issues as they pertain to women.Feminists and just some women in general will NOT appreciate this book. Not gonna lie though, right or wrong, this book definitely appealed to my snarky, crass kind of humor, reminding me once again that I apparently have the personality and sense of humor of a dude. But whatevers.That's not a fuck I care to give, apparently.",3.0
4,Who Moved My Cheese?,,3.86,"['January', '1,', '1999']",SPOILER ALERT! I am going to save anyone who thinks they need to read this book time & money by summarizing the entire book in the next two sentences: Things change. Learn to adapt.You're welcome. If you still feel the need to spend money please contact me & I will tell you where to send it.,1.0
5,How to Win Friends and Influence People,,4.22,"['October', '1,', '1936']","This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review.",2.0
6,Areté: Activate Your Heroic Potential,,4.75,"['November', '14,', '2023']","Brian Johnson is my favorite teacher philosopher that is living that I've read/listened to. I've been following his newsletter and +1s since I met him in a cafe in Santa Monica in ~2007. I've consumed countless of his Notes (book summaries) and 101's on my journey, and have found his recapitulation of the masters, and just his *energy* around the topics to be infectious and immensely helpful. Brian is food for the spirit, and I can't wait to read this.",
7,Think and Grow Rich,,4.18,"['January', '1,', '1937']","Let's be honest to ourselves and face the truth: success in business depends on a complex equation with a lot of variants, such as 1) how well your business idea adapts to the powers of supply and demand, which govern (and oppress) contemporary society, 2) where you come from economically to begin with (I've seen aromatherapy businesses run by middle-class sons of bitches grow and be more ""successful"" than neighborhood food establishments run by poor honest people), 3) how much investing capital you have at the time of creating your business, 4) your race, and 5) sheer dumb luck. Quotes like “The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat” are ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous and delve into the worst kind of new-agey, self-help bullshitting bullying: victim-blaming. So, if your business is not successful, you are to blame, because you simply failed to desire it enough? Fuck that shit. This book is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in today's first-world-white-heterosexual-male-dominated economic culture. Tell me that such ideas as ""desiring it enough"" would work in Somalia, hell, even in Egypt, and then we'll talk. Don't waste your time with this codswallop. Read real literature instead: you'll definitely increase your IQ this way.",1.0
8,The Secret,The worldwide bestselling phenomenon that has helped millions tap the power of the law that governs all our lives to create—intentionally and effortlessly—a joyful life.,3.73,"['November', '28,', '2006']","this website is too kind. one star means ""didn't like it"". I hate, hate, hate this book with absolute passion. sorry if you like oprah but she seriously did the world a disservice by recommending this book. apparently there is a dvd also that i don't even think i could stomach. so here's the concept behind ""The Secret"". You can attract good things to you through your good thoughts. Ok, I'm on board with that. It has worked for me. Ooh, I already knew the Secret! too bad I didn't use it to make millions like this chick! But no, it goes further. You attract bad things to you through your negative thoughts. Well, negative thoughts are pretty useless, so I can see benefit in trying to decrease or eliminate them. And one time (true story) I did get robbed while traveling after worrying about it for 3 weeks. BUT. There is no gray area with this one. According to the author, people who are raped, killed, maimed, tortured - they all bring it on themselves with their negative thoughts. The people in Darfur should be thinking ""here comes the food, there go the guns"". The book goes on to say that weight management is simply a matter of ""thinking thin"" and not looking at fat people (for real), that if you have a stack of bills to pay you should instead picture checks coming in, that you can have everything you want through visualization, such as your hands on the steering wheel of your car, and that you can cure your cancer watching funny movies. There is a weak chapter at the end about how you can use your Secret powers for the common good, like world peace, but why would you want to waste it when you can be driving your new Hummer? I would go so far as to say that this book is not only BAD but it is DANGEROUS. It promotes the self-absorbed, materialistic, shallow outlook of predominantly rich white people to the exclusion of the rest of the planet - while managing to blame them for their problems and justify those in possession of the Secret for not using their visualized wealth to promote social change. Aah, brilliant. genius. avoid this book. do not give money to this woman and her brilliant marketing pyramid!",1.0
9,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",,4.12,"['April', '8,', '1997']","I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting ""This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!"" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book. Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages: * When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses. * Try to own things that put money in your pocket. * If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money. There you go. That's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics. Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she hasn't been ""discovered"" yet. He tells her to take courses in marketing, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to market them. I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I'd feel for responding to a ""get rich quick"" spam mail.",1.0
10,Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,New York Times Best SellerOver 5 million copies sold,4.34,"['November', '15,', '2018']","I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, it's an inspiring story of a man who has overcome a lifetime of struggle and proved that you can do anything if you're willing to push yourself. In the first half of the book especially this was a message that resonated with me and made me think about David Goggins as a man to look up to. On the other hand, it's a cautionary tale of a man who is so stubborn he can not learn from his past mistakes. He is constantly going into situations underprepared and then pushing his body past the point of sanity in order to accomplish a goal and seemingly expecting applause for that. Were he in some life or death situation then I might just give him said applause, but instead, he is always just trying to prove something to himself which is a really unhealthy way to go through life. Overall there were two main lessons to take from Mr Goggins story. One is that if you really put your mind to a task you can achieve the impossible. The second is that there is nothing admirable about taking the path of highest resistance just for the sake of personal pride. Yes, Mr Goggins has achieved amazing things, but there are others who have achieved similar results in a more intelligent and healthy way. In the end, I came in exactly on the halfway mark in regards to how I felt about this book and I have rounded up for the sake of not wanting to give this book a 2-star review. One final note is a comment on the audiobook. Mr Goggins made the decision to insert multiple interludes that feature the narrator interviewing him. These were interesting at first but soon grew really tiresome. They felt really self-serving as each one went along the lines of the narrator expressing how in awe of David Goggins he was, and David Goggins expressing yet again how hard it was for him to achieve his goals. I could have done without 50% of these as well.",3.0
11,You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life,The #1 New York Times Bestseller You Are A Badass is the self-help book for people who desperately want to improve their lives but don't want to get busted doing it.,3.95,"['April', '23,', '2013']","Not good. I can sum up this book pretty quickly. If you want to make a change in your life, or if you are not happy with your life, you are the only one who can make it better. There were a few things that really bothered me. If you are depressed, you cannot simply decide that you are not going to be depressed anymore and get yourself out and have fun. It is apparent that the author has never experienced depression, or been a very sympathetic friend to anyone she knows who has been depressed. I also feel that some of her advice is not very practical in the real world. So if I'm a single mom supporting 4-5 kids, and I've always dreamed of starting my own business, I should just quit my job? I should buy expensive things, that I might not be able to pay for? There is some good advice on stopping negative thoughts, but some of the examples of going for what you really want are just not practical for most people.",1.0
12,The Last Lecture,,4.26,"['April', '8,', '2008']","I sat down to write my review of “The Last Lecture” on Friday July 25th. Before I started to write, I decided to check Randy Pausch's website for any updates on his condition. He had died that morning at the age of 47. The book, and the lecture itself, now take on new meaning.For those who aren't aware, Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students. What would you say? What wisdom would you impart? What are your lessons in life? For Randy, this was not a hypothetical question. Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced “the elephant in the room”: advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months. With this revelation out of the way, he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others. The lecture was so full of optimism, clarity, hope, humour, and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book. “The Last Lecture” contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture, plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experience.Like the lecture, the book is earnest and straightforward. Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it. He fills his stories with humour, occasionally laugh out loud. What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind. It's hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author. He seems like a great guy, someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend. I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success; his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words. This still comes across in the book, although not as strongly as in the lecture. In fact, without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words, reading the book can almost get a bit tiring. I recall thinking on a number of occasions: “Ok, we know that you're a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up, you don't need to keep telling me”. Some of the advice in the book, especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture, can be a bit tough to swallow. For example, his advice to always carry 200$ in cash in your wallet; does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book? Similarly, he often speaks of the great mentors, friends, and supporters that he has had through his life; not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their student's careers. Finally, his advice to never give up (“Brick walls are not there to keep us out, they are there so we can show how much we want something”) sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement. He never says to expect something for nothing, but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it. Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge. Fortunately these moments are fairly rare, and as long as you don't read the book in a single sitting (which is quite possible) then you probably won't feel too overwhelmed.Interestingly, shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture. What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far? It is quite a difficult question to answer. I'm sure that I don't have the life experience to give a good enough answer, but it's quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response. I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book. We need people like Randy, who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it. Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice, what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in, and that he thought others would benefit from hearing. His life, lecture, book, and his death remind me of a quote from Dr. Howard Thurman: ""Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive”. Even as he lived the last few months of his life, I know that Randy was truly alive.",3.0
13,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,,4.13,"['April', '25,', '2012']","I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail.",2.0
14,Girl Wash your Face,,3.58,"['February', '6,', '2018']","Some parts of this book spoke to me (yes, I can be better at showing up for myself), and others made me want to throw the book across the room and scream. I struggled with every word she said about diet and body image—what was meant to be uplifting and inspiring was preached as scientific fact from someone with no medical/dietetic credentials. She had nothing to back up her claims, but she preached it like doctrine. I also really struggled with the story of how she met her husband. She says that people may have issue with her sharing it and that it isn’t meant for it to be used to condone an unhealthy relationship. But....she married the man from her super unhealthy relationship. Guys, don’t marry the guy who “brings you to bars and ignores you while he hits on other women.” Don’t marry the guy who “only calls you at night when he’s been drinking but ignores you during the day.” Don’t marry the guy who you “give your virginity to because you don’t know how else to keep him interested.” I mean, really. She gave so much time to how terrible their first year was and then gives a quick “but now everything is great!” And it just doesn’t work for me.I think the point of the husband story was that when she told him she needed to be respected and she didn't want him calling anymore, he realized she was worth respecting. She had to respect herself to get respect, yada yada. Buuuutttt telling someone you don't want them to contact you anymore and then having them show up on your doorstep the next morning is literally the opposite of respect. I love it when I set boundaries and people totally ignore them—romance! Edit: I have to come back and discuss more things that are not okay. The diet pills? She essentially tells everyone that she and her roommate survived off of diet pills to the point that they were hallucinating, so they stopped taking them and gained back 40 lbs. She doesn’t discourage this, if anything the quick “oh and then we gained weight and became less attractive” seems like a subtle “I can’t recommend this BUT if you want to lose weight here’s how to do it.” Sooo not okay. Additionally, when people come to her her diet advice (why is she giving diet advice? Is she a dietician? Does she have any medical knowledge?) she tells them to start by drinking more water, and when they’ve mastered that start cutting out foods. Here’s an idea: listen to your body!! Thin =/= worthy/good/important.Another edit: I was on a plane with my young exhausted kids today and was thinking how an outsider would totally judge my parenting skills, but I gotta do what I gotta do and my in-flight parenting techniques are totally different from day-to-day. Then I remembered how Rachel went off on the totally exhausted mom for giving her kid candy on a plane. Maybe there was more to it that I’m not remembering? But honestly, anyone who has flown with their kids knows the struggle is real.",1.0

3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0

How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion.

Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

21,Cascade Failure,,4.00,"['March', '19,', '2024']","I would like to thank Edelweiss and Tor Books for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.This was a super simple galaxy romp, with an interesting crew and a full of ""feelings"" AI captain. There was a touch of tension, some running-through-the-marketplace action and some performative melodrama that was about as believable as Saint and Jal's ""die for each other"" vibe being a ""nothin' but bros"" flex. Regardless, this had potential but it read a bit flat to me. I honestly don't think I'm the ""goofy"" SciFi type. I thought Anke was weird... and not in the good way. And her dialogue was exceptionally cringe. Nash's too. I was NOT a fan of either of these two, and I think there's a definite line between quirky and immature, and I would have enjoyed this book so much more had these two characters read less puerile. I'm probably not the intended reader for this, so I won't belabour the point, because I'd like to forget how awkward I felt reading their POVS. Other than that, Cascade Failure isn't doing anything new, but there were still some fun moments scattered throughout. I enjoyed the first part much more than the second, and somehow I'd found a deep well of patience for whatever the fk was going on between Saint and Jal that kept me intrigued enough to stick it out. But like most of this book, there just wasn't enough depth in the characterizations, or the plot for that matter, for me to feel invested in the outcome.I do like Saint and Jal and Eoan a lot though, even if they are just the prototypical soldier-cyborg-AI triad that's pretty much a genre staple, so there's that. Cascade failure isn't reinventing the wheel, and will appeal more to those new/unfamiliar with the genre. But there's a bit of potential here and I'm curious enough to see where the Ambit is headed to next, so I'll probably continue this series a bit later on...once enough time has passed and I've significantly forgotten how cringey I found both Anke and Nash to be.",3.0

Rep: achillean mc, agender li, agender societyGalley provided by publisherIn the months between reading The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House, I made a promise with myself: if Natasha Pulley’s next book didn’t do away with the misogyny that has characterised her previous five books to varying degrees (as I mentioned in my 
Valery K
 review), then I would give up on her future books. Well, I have good news on that front, because there was no misogyny in this one!If only because there were no women* whatsoever.Now, this really isn’t my primary issue with the book, except that I think it ties in with a general misunderstanding of gender which undercuts anything this book might be trying to say about the topic (this is, to be perfectly honest, my most generous take on it. That it’s trying to say anything at all, notwithstanding the question of whether it’s capable of doing so). No, this is merely a single issue within a sea of them, which, lucky you!, I will be enumerating in this review. Stop reading now if you want to a. avoid spoilers, or b. simply desire the feeling of wanting to read this book. For those of you who read further, well. Godspeed.There are very few reviews which I can’t just write from my notes, but my notes are so long and cumbersome for this one that I have actually needed to sit down and get them in order before even attempting a review. In trying to group together all of my problems here, I think most of it comes down to failures in worldbuilding. A second, smaller but not more minor, set of issues relates to the characters. A final set — and this one I can call more minor — regards Pulley’s writing itself, which I never thought I’d say, having loved it in at least four of her previous five. Oh and then, one big glaring, what the fuck bit.So, let’s take them one by one.— The worldbuilding.1. Gender.We’re starting with one of the two big issues straight up and that’s Pulley’s treatment of gender. Or, to be more exact, the way she has created a society without gender. Firstly, I have to say, reading this at the same time as Ann Leckie’s Imperial Radch, a sci-fi series that thinks about gender in an interesting way, was a mistake. All it did was show up how badly it was done here.Pulley’s concept of gender is solely based on pronoun use. It took me a little while to figure it out (mostly because I couldn’t believe the justification would be this inane), but the reason everyone on Mars uses they pronouns is twofold: one, they all speak Mandarin and, because in spoken Mandarin ‘he’ and ‘she’ sound the same, they decided instead to just make it a ‘they’ pronoun and apply it to everyone. Thus, we have a distinction between the “civilised” Martians (who are a few generations removed from having travelled from Earth to Mars) who only use ‘they’, and the “uncivilised” refugees who still insist on using ‘he’ and ‘she’. And secondly, while choosing to use ‘they’ — which I also want to note was, it sounds, just an arbitrary decision — they also eliminated “extreme gender traits” in DNA. Whatever that means!All of this, I think, just shows a fundamental misunderstanding of our own concept of gender in the 21st century, let alone what a concept of gender a few decades down the line might look like. But what we can safely say is that, if it’s not based on pronouns now, it’s hardly going to suddenly convert to being based on pronouns in the future, is it? Not to mention the whole pronouns thing is actually being translated from Mandarin to make this happen. The characters are speaking Mandarin as the book happens, albeit a Mandarin which has had a few generations to develop from Mandarin as we know it now (enough, it seems, for Mars to exact genetic alterations on humans too, while not being that far removed into the future. And here I was thinking these things moved slowly…). I could buy that there’s a ‘they’ pronoun developed in this futuristic Mandarin. I cannot buy that they basically said “well, these two words sound the same so let’s merge them together”. That is. Not how language works! Not to mention that these words in written Mandarin are still different. You can’t just smush them together and translate them as ‘they’ because they sound the same. Are you going to do that in English for ‘sun’ and ‘son’? No! And, even in spoken Mandarin, there’ll often be context to tell you which pronoun the speaker means, so I would imagine it’s rarely hugely ambiguous. Mandarin speakers are not considering themselves to be going around calling everyone ‘they’ because the words sound the same. (Plus, I feel it’s somewhat disrespectful to nonbinary Mandarin speakers who, you know, might want their own pronouns?) (P.S. for a more accurate take from a Mandarin speaker, see the first point of this review. My analysis was primarily based on Pulley's claims within the book.)Moving on from the pronouns, let’s come to this whole thing of eliminating extreme gender traits from DNA, thus effectively making everyone agender. It’s hard to put into words just how much this whole idea wants to poke my eyes out. It plays exactly into TERF rhetoric that gender equals biology. By removing the “biology” (questionable to say the least?), you remove the “gender”. So our agender society has TERF-y logic underpinning it. Combine this with the part I mentioned at the start where using ‘they’ makes you “civilised” and ‘he’ or ‘she’ “uncivilised” and you get some really weird shit. There are “pro-gender” terrorists in this and I cannot for the life of me tell if it’s some TERF allegory, or in which direction it’s meant to be. Are the Martians TERFs because of their biological understanding of gender? Are the Earth diaspora TERFs because of their insistence on clinging to Earth ideas of gender (which, by the way, does not appear to include nonbinary or trans people in itself)? Is everyone a TERF???One piece more of information can inform us here: in creating an agender society, Natasha Pulley has, barring the minorest of minor characters, entirely eradicated women from her novel. Maybe no one’s a TERF then. Don’t need feminism if you don’t have women!(That’s sarcastic, btw.)2. In-world racism.Second of the major issues with worldbuilding regards the in-world concepts of racism, and how exactly characters are racist. This is a book about anti-immigrant politics, about a politician whose entire platform rests on xenophobic and racist rhetoric. Basically, what we have here is a book that essentially translates as “far right politician forced to fake-date political opposite and they fall in love”. And yes, I should absolutely have read that blurb and stayed the fuck away. Alas, I do not appear to possess basic survival instincts, but, since I did read this, I can detail exactly what’s awful about it!Let me just say, overall this felt like a very strange take from a British author in the midst of such an anti-immigration Tory government. I don’t want to make any assumptions about Pulley’s personal politics, but uh. Yeah. You’ll see why.Once again, Pulley demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge about how racism works, and falls straight into that SFF trap that has authors try to justify racism (see this article for explanation if you don’t already know this part). It turns out that humans coming to Mars from Earth are, due to the differences in gravity, automatically bigger and stronger than Martians who’ve spent years there and who are frail and fragile in comparison. So much that an Earther might easily kill a Martian with just a tap and are thus forced to remain in literal cages as they go about their day. The reason our love interest in particular is xenophobic is because they were attacked by an Earther and injured a little while before the events of the book take place. Thus, they choose to call for all Earthers to be surgically altered so they’re less strong and pose no threat to Martians (a surgery which drastically ruins Earther quality of life, by the by).Now, January — January is the most frustrating protagonist in this respect. Instead of challenging Gale on their bigotry, he tries to accommodate them. He’s repeatedly saying he disagrees with the idea that Earthers are dangerous, only to turn around and say “well, we are dangerous, we might accidentally kill a Martian”, like he’s justifying it. He wears his cage almost permanently around Gale, and even hands them the key to it, so he can’t take it off until Gale decides they’re not scared of him any longer (a decision which has a negative impact on his own health). He spends a lot of the time advocating for his own oppression. A common conversation between January and Gale will go like so:GALE, A BIGOT: Earthstrongers must be all surgically altered so they’re not dangerous to native Martians.JANUARY, A WET DRIP: You’re a bigot! But actually, you’re right because we are soooo much stronger and sooooo dangerous to you guys :( Yes, we should all be kept in cages :(I don’t even think you can make the effective argument that January’s been indoctrinated by Martian bigotry because he’s not even been there a year! He fails to conform to the pronouns thing, but he’s perfectly happy considering himself dangerous and a potential killer all the time? Uh, okay. It takes a good half of the book for January to stand up to Gale’s xenophobia in any way, at which point it suddenly becomes justified for another reason. Great!There are another couple of questionable aspects to mention before we move on (okay, questionable might be too weak a word). Firstly, there’s an undercurrent of suspicion that the immigrants are coming over to subsume the Martian colony back into Earth China, which isn’t that challenged. I mean, it’s revealed that the end that the non-fascist politician is actually working to do this, so it’s almost like… fascist good??? Secondly, the plot ends with the building of an immigration detention centre. I kid you not, that’s how they resolve the arrival of these refugees. By building a detention centre.But don’t worry, it’s a nice detention centre! It has toilets and everything!3. Other wishy-washy worldbuilding aspects.In general, I think Natasha Pulley’s writing lends itself better to real world fiction, or rather, fiction based in a setting she doesn’t have to make up so much. Where there’s some grounding in what we (and she) already know(s). A lot of the worldbuilding in this one felt somewhat flimsy, included because why not!, rather than because it made sense or added to the narrative.Case in point: the talking mammoths. For some apparent reason, there are both polar bears and mammoths on Mars. And the mammoths have language! They can talk! They can offer Gale political advice! And, I KID YOU NOT, it is from these mammoths, in a single conversation, that Gale learns tolerance and acceptance (and thus uncages January).It was at this point that I’m pretty sure I burst into hysterics and checked out of the book. The talking mammoths felt so entirely out of step with the whole rest of the story, and that they were what prompted Gale’s change of heart (not, you might think, January proving himself trustworthy (as if he should have had to, etc etc))? I give up trying to make sense of anything about this, there’s no point! The only function they appeared to serve (besides the whole teaching tolerance nonsense) was that you can point to the book and say look! It’s got talking mammoths!“Was I just schooled about the nature of good government by a mammoth?” Gale asks. Boy, I really fucking hope not.(It also felt like Pulley wrote the mechanical octopus into The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and has been trying to recapture that kind of effortless whimsy in her books ever since. Alas, talking mammoths are anything but effortless.)— The characters.Everything I have to say from here will get progressively shorter, I’m sure you’re glad to know. In fact, my comments on the characters will probably be the shortest of all. Really, what I want to say here is solely that Pulley’s characters are starting to feel incredibly samey, in particular the last three protagonists she’s written. Thaniel and Merrick are probably her most distinct of characters, followed by Joe (simply because he’s the first of the next three). Yes, they all share similarities (perhaps more than you might want for an author), but not so much as Joe, Valery and January do.This is, likely, a disservice to Joe and The Kingdoms (which is my favourite of Pulley’s books, although I fear testing it by rereading it after this!). He is, after all, the prototype. And maybe my view of Valery and January as very similar to him is borne of the fact that The Half Life of Valery K and The Mars House are easily my least favourite Pulley books. But the fact remains that I don’t think any of the three are meaningfully distinct. Their POVs sound exactly the same — a fact which could be put down to writing style, yes — but they also feel like the same character cast in three different plots.There’s also a pattern appearing where Pulley’s couples are made up of a big, brutish-seeming-but-actually-a-gentle-giant character, along with a smaller, frailer character (often also more womanish?? But that could be retrospective analysis from me), and a fair amount is made of their difference in size and power. Admittedly, that last part is greater here simply because the whole thing about physical power is plot-relevant (or rather, bigotry-relevant). Your mileage may vary on how much you can stand the whole size difference schtick, but with six books of couples forming this pattern, I at least am starting to feel a bit like. Ooooh-kaaaay.— The writing.Pulley’s writing is, as ever, lovely, and probably one of the only positive things I have to mention about this book, but even that comes with a caveat. All of Pulley’s books have this quiet kind of gentleness to them, which worked for the first four books and even with the brutality of The Kingdoms, where it felt like the contrast between that gentleness and the non-gentleness of events highlighted the latter. It has not worked well here, much like it didn’t in The Half Life of Valery K. In the latter case, it served more to feel like it was downplaying the horrors of the gulag. This was probably because Pulley was more inclined to fully describe the brutality of The Kingdoms and more likely to brush over it in The Half Life of Valery K (possibly because the romance was between a prisoner and a guard?). In The Mars House, that gentleness becomes tonally quite odd. There’s all this anti-immigrant rhetoric and discussion of disabling surgery and eugenics, and it’s all packaged up in this writing that feels like it obscures those horrors. Like I said, odd.Of course, though, if you had full access to those horrors, if it didn’t feel like there was a blanket being placed over it all to muffle the noise, there would be no way in hell that you could root for Gale as January’s love interest.— The what the fuck bit.Last but not least, and really quite pertinent given that, as I’m writing this, Israeli occupation forces are in the midst of committing genocide in Gaza and every day brings with it more and more horrific war crimes by their soldiers, this book, set in the future, is doing its bit to bring that reality nearer. There are two mentions of Israel in this and, firstly, that’s two too many. One is the mention of an AI having a “wonderful, homely Israeli accent”. Which, yuck, and also you could have chosen any country in the world to make this comment, so why an illegal apartheid state, huh? (Also January is from Britain: why would he consider Israel to be “homely”??) But to make it even more egregious, with the next mention, Pulley erases Palestine in its entirety.I stress that this book is set in the future for this very reason. In Pulley’s future, it seems that Israel has succeeded in its aim of murdering every Palestinian and wiping out their state, culture, and entire existence. There is, in here, a scene set during Christmas, in which a young Martian child reading an Earther book, asks what Bethlehem is. January has no response, so Gale cuts in to say that it’s a town in Israel.A quick google search would tell you that Bethlehem is a town in the West Bank, a.k.a. in Occupied Palestine. Not Israel! In fact, being in the West Bank, in an area where (technically) Israelis are not permitted. So not only has Pulley chosen to normalise the existence of an illegal settler-colonial state in her future-set book, she has also chosen to entirely wipe out the land’s indigenous population. Just giving the IOF a helping hand!So, with this comes to a close possibly the longest review I have ever written, and definitely the longest essay-type thing I have since finishing my dissertation a few years ago. If you’ve stuck with me this far, congrats! I hope I’ve not killed your enthusiasm over this one too much. If you’re skipping to the end, I offer you this TL;DR: in conclusion, fascism solved because the fascist marries someone oppressed 🫶🏻.*This is not quite true because, reading through my notes, I found the following: chapter 20: OH MY GOD IT’S A WOMAN. She lasted for one single chapter though, so I think it barely counts.",1.0

Often we see characters who are technically flawed, but their flaws don't actually enter the narrative in a significant way, and I find it far more satisfying when they do. This book succeeds on that level and I was impressed with it.I also stopped to screenshot a few lines because I found them to be really lovely, and here's my favorite one:""Once he's gone, I slide backward through the hologram of what looks like finished steel and slip into the dark the city doesn't know is under its skin."" Anyway, if you haven't read the first in this series, now's the time.

That's pretty damn close to what we got here with Alien Clay, and I adored it.This is a book about divergent evolution, symbiotic relationships in nature, revolution and uprising and yet, at the same time, becoming a part of the machine in which you live your life.It's full to the brim with Tchaikovsky-isms, with a liberal dose of body horror and all sorts of creepy alien insects and creatures.I'll admit it did take me a little while to get with the first-person perspective - it felt a little clunky and unnecessary at first, but it ended up working brilliantly and it had completely grown on me by the quarter way mark.

29,Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension,,4.27,"['March', '12,', '2024']","Not everything is an omen, Crosby. Not everything means something.Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a unique upper YA story told in verse about convictions so strong that they eventually lead to family and friends turning against each other and, in this case, believing in the end of the world. It reminded me sometimes of We Are the Ants by Shaun David Hutchinson (one of my favorite YA books ever), even though both stories are way different. Crosby is an anxious, shaky mess, distrustful, and balancing on the edge of reality and deeply held convictions. She believes firmly in witchcraft, and when her best friend Shannon buys earrings she likes (from Malachite), and Crosby tries to convince her those earrings are not the right match for her, they fall apart. Then, she’s in college and watches at a party through a telescope. When she sees the rogue dwarf planet Malachite, Colby is convinced Sharon’s earrings are a warning and that the planet is a message for something bad to happen.  The writing is beautiful and poetic and so fitting for a story like this. The characters are fully developed, and the descriptions are so vivid, I felt I was there, but even without them, I could read this book only for the writing, immersing myself in the words and the sentences, the cadence, and the rhythm. It’s soft and atmospheric while Crosby’s anxiety and the eeriness of her beliefs bubble under the surface but emerge more and more. Meet Me in the Fourth Dimension is a fantastic debut, and I can’t thank Rita Feinstein enough for asking me if I wanted to read an ARC. And thank you, Pagestreet YA, for sending me this ARC! Follow me on Instagram",4.0

To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.",4.00,"['August', '13,', '2020']","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————

31,Shadow Me,,4.00,"['March', '5,', '2019']","Sooo I knew I loved Kenji Kishimoto..... but this book made me realize that I would rip my fucking heart out and put it on a platter for Kenji Kishimoto. I LOVED this installment!!!! I think this book was the perfect balance of exploring Kenji's voice, getting his funny inner monologue, learning more about the world, and seeing the events of Restore Me from his eyes. I wouldn't necessarily call it a bridge book between books 4 and 5 (honestly, these chapters could have been thrown in at the end of Restore Me because I actually think they better describe the events than Warner and Juliette did), but I still had SO much fun reading it and was laughing and gasping at all the new information and world building and conversations that we didn't see in Restore Me. I have a TON more to say about this with theories and new info reveals but it's 4:30 AM and I've been making my way through this book since midnight so my brain is just a big happy mush in my skull because I love Kenji so much and I adored this novella.Old reviewCONFIRMED KENJI POV!!!!!!!! I'm so stoked. Honestly, I wish this came sooner instead of just a month before Defy Me, but I'm not about to complain about more content.

32,The Institute,,4.20,"['September', '10,', '2019']","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

To leave a mark on wilderness?”
I was one of the few readers (or so it seemed) left underwhelmed by Mandel's Station Eleven when I read it back in 2014. The hype and gushing reviews seemed at odds with the very okay novel I read, which is why I passed on reading The Glass Hotel.Now I'm wondering: should I go back and read the author's other stuff? Because I have to admit I found Sea of Tranquility riveting and beautiful.From what I remember, it is not stylistically that different to Station Eleven-- both are quiet, slow-build stories-- but I found the characters here fascinating and the exploration of both the simulation theory and what, if anything, that means for humans, deeply moving. We begin with several chapters (or ""Parts"") of seemingly unrelated characters and stories, each set in a very different time and place-- Edwin arrives in Canada in the year 1912, Mirella goes to speak to the brother of an estranged old friend in 2020 NYC, Olive visits Earth for a book tour in 2203, scientists investigate the theory that the world is a simulation in 2401. Similar motifs appear in each story and it is clear they are linked, but how?As the stories weave together and overlap, we begin to see the recurring theme in each one until it all comes together in a big picture at the end.I really enjoyed it. There is this nostalgic quality to Mandel's writing that made me feel like I was revisiting places I'd been long ago, even though I obviously hadn't. I don't know if all the pandemic subplots were strictly necessary and I think the author could have achieved the same goal without that being a recurring theme, but this is a small complaint. The novel touches upon the big questions like the meaning of it all and the nature of reality, as well as exploring the human obsession with the end of the world:
“I think, as a species, we have a desire to believe that we’re living at the climax of the story. It’s a kind of narcissism. We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.”
And, in the end, it all seems to be saying that maybe there is no meaning, maybe none of it's real, whatever that means, maybe the world is always ending, and maybe the real question is: does it even matter?",4.0
35,A Psalm for the Wild-Built,,4.28,"['July', '13,', '2021']","If this is not your first Becky Chambers book, you know what to expect. Ever since her first novel The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet she’s been writing what I can only call “comfort science fiction/ cozypunk”, showing the worlds where you would really love to live, the worlds that learned from mistakes of the past and moved on in better directions, the worlds mostly inhabited by genuinely nice people, with everything having a feeling of an unironically happy hippie commune, complete with earnest conversations about life and its meaning.And that’s what we get here, in a tiny contemplative novella whose dedication simply states, “For anybody who could use a break.”
 “This had been the way of things since the Transition, when the people had redivided the surface of their moon. Fifty percent of Panga’s single continent was designated for human use; the rest was left to nature, and the ocean was barely touched at all. It was a crazy split, if you thought about it: half the land for a single species, half for the hundreds of thousands of others. But then, humans had a knack for throwing things out of balance. Finding a limit they’d stick to was victory enough.”
  
It’s a story of a utopia, a planet where humanity left behind the Factory Age and moved on to sustainable and highly spiritual (as opposed to dogmatically religious) life in harmony with nature, with dwellings made of biodegradable materials, half a planet left for wilderness with which you do not interfere, and existence of tea monks who travel from scenic village to scenic village setting pop-up tea shops where one can drink their sorrows away with herbal teas. Because people will still have existential crises and will get hit with wanderlust even in the most inconvenient times.
 “I’m tired,” Dex said softly. “My work doesn’t satisfy me like it used to, and I don’t know why. I was so sick of it that I did a stupid, dangerous thing, and now that I’ve done it, I don’t know what to do next. I don’t know what I thought I’d find out here, because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I can’t stay here, but I’m scared about going back and having that feeling pick right back up where it left off. I’m scared, and I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.”
In this world a long time ago robots somehow gained consciousness and parted ways with humanity to live in the wilderness, respecting each other’s choices and agency. The departure of robots apparently becomes a catalyst for the betterment of humanity. And now for the first time a human tea monk Dex (on a quest fueled by ennui and a longing for purpose) and a robot Splendid Speckled Mosscap (on a journey to find out about humans and what makes them tick) meet and engage in philosophical discussions and debates and lay foundations for a beautiful friendship.  
This entire novella is a philosophical dialogue in the setting of ecological paradise, a cozy version of Plato’s symposium held in the wilderness with some tea.
 “You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine! Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”
This is not a story of survival or conflict or discovery. It is a story of dissatisfaction even with the most comfortable life in the most ideal world imaginable, the world which by any definition is a utopia — and not because of any inherent flaws in the utopia, not because every utopia harbors within it the seeds of dystopia, but purely because human spirit gets restless sometimes even in the best of circumstances, even in the world that I would give my left ovary to inhabit.You see, living in our current world that is not quite moving towards the lovely green utopia of Chambers’ planet, I do tend to view the world through less rose-tinted glasses, focusing more on survival and security as priorities and sidelining the finer things in life. But here we are a bit past that, those lucky bastards. Here they can afford to focus on spiritual pleasure and not on the basic needs.
 “Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.”
Yes, the questions Chambers raises are those “first world problems” that I’m usually the first one to want to shrug off — but they are very important to the human nature. When you have the luxury of having your basic needs met and comfort of security in life, the nagging feelings of dissatisfaction and desire for purpose or fulfillment or wanderlust will come to the forefront, because, as Dex notes, humans need more than just focus on survival alone — once that basic need has been fulfilled.
“Survival alone isn’t enough for most people. We’re more than surviving now. We’re thriving. We take care of each other, and the world takes care of us, and we take care of it, and around it goes. And yet, that’s clearly not enough, because there’s a need for people like me. No one comes to me hungry or sick. They come to me tired, or sad, or a little lost. It’s like you said about the … the ants. And the paint. You can’t just reduce something to its base components. We’re more than that. We have wants and ambitions beyond physical needs. That’s human nature as much as anything else.”
All in all, it’s a quietly optimistic, comforting, heartfelt book, focusing on the nuances of human soul in a very good world inhabited by very good people and robots. To complete the ambiance, I would have needed a hot cocoa and a warm cozy blanket on a pleasantly rainy day — but we are in the middle of a hot dry fiery California summer, so there goes that pleasant atmosphere.  
————And yet some things kept nagging at me, aided by that ever-present cynicism that tends to pop up at inconvenient moments.One was the robot character, Mosscap. It’s pretty indistinguishable from a human, with the same everything — speech patterns, logic, and even struggles with math and numbers. The subtitle of this new series - Monk and Robot — implies differences, and Mosscap itself states that “We don’t have to fall into the same category to be of equal value” — but to me they were reading as almost indistinguishable in voice and behavior, and that left me a bit unsatisfied. The other issue was the ending — or the lack thereof, because this novella really should have been part 1 of a larger novel, perhaps the exposition at the beginning of a longer book. And tea. After “Ancillary Justice” series, I’m a bit twitchy when tea makes on-page appearance. Another one was the luxurious tease of this hope for the future. Because it just IS? We are told that the Transition happened from the grim Factory Age to this idyllic paradise, and my brain just keeps nagging at me about the implausibility of that given human nature and drives, and my inner cynicism starts running rampant — that cynicism that finds it a bit too cozy and luxurious to read about the world that might as well have come from a pretty concept picture of ecological paradise. There is a point where cozy and comforting becomes too much, and I felt that we are dangerously close to that boundary here. It’s a fable, I kept convincing myself, but my inner cynic kept muttering unpleasant remarks that would not be welcomed on planet Panga (hey, I just got it — Panga is pretty much “Pangaea”, right?).It feels like a dessert, a meringue that is soft and fluffy and will be very nice after a solid meat and potatoes course — but without that course not as satisfying. You gotta be in the right mood for it, and I don’t think I entirely was. I like my books with just a smidgeon more of teeth and bite, but that’s not Becky Chambers fault but mine entirely. Her book will be perfect for a perfect reader, and this time I wasn’t among them. Maybe I’ll feel less cynical next time.3.5 stars.  Less cynical among us will love it. 
“The robot thought. “I have wants and ambitions too, Sibling Dex. But if I fulfill none of them, that’s okay. I wouldn’t—” It nodded at Dex’s cuts and bruises, at the bug bites and dirty clothes. “I wouldn’t beat myself up over it.”Dex turned the mug over and over in their hands. “It doesn’t bother you?” Dex said. “The thought that your life might mean nothing in the end?”“That’s true for all life I’ve observed. Why would it bother me?” Mosscap’s eyes glowed brightly. “Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing? Here we are, in this incomprehensibly large universe, on this one tiny moon around this one incidental planet, and in all the time this entire scenario has existed, every component has been recycled over and over and over again into infinitely incredible configurations, and sometimes, those configurations are special enough to be able to see the world around them. You and I—we’re just atoms that arranged themselves the right way, and we can understand that about ourselves. Is that not amazing?”

36,Prophet Song,,4.14,"['August', '24,', '2023']","At first, I thought it would be better to wait a while before I write anything about Prophet Song (2023) by Paul Lynch, just to calm down a little and catch my breath, but then I realized that my ability to build coherent sentences about this reading experience might diminish over time. I devoured this novel in two days. It trapped my attention from the first sentence and ensnared me at once.Prepare to have your emotions wrapped around Paul Lynch’s finger and the strings will be pulled tighter and tighter with every page. The thing I found most impressive about this novel is its atmosphere. The tension keeps growing gradually and the feeling of menace is more and more suffocating. The word exhilarating in the blurb baffled me as I found Prophet Song one of the darkest and most depressing books I have ever read. It depicts the rise of totalitarianism resulting in civil war, seen through the eyes of a family with four children. The novel is set in Ireland at an unspecified time but judging from the technology the characters are using it is contemporary. Bertolt Brecht's motto about the dark times was a perfect choice: the novel protagonist, Eilish, is akin to Mother Courage, dealing with unimaginable traumas. She does her best to keep her family together against all odds. By the way, Mother Courage's son is called Eilif which sounds so similar to Eilish. Both Brecht and Lynch's portrayals of motherhood in the time of moral apocalypse are heart-wrenching.The relief coming from the fact that Prophet Song is a dystopian novel doesn't last long as there is nothing unrealistic about the plot: the nightmarish events could have happened anytime, anywhere. Some passages hit unsettlingly close to home:  The government has taken control of the judiciary by putting their own people in, that’s the nub of the problem, once you get your own people in you can do whatever you like. Sounds exactly like Poland at the moment.Maybe one year and a half ago I would have found Paul Lynch's vision of totalitarianism overdrawn but the war in Ukraine proves that it's not. I couldn't stop thinking of Ukrainian children while reading passages like this: She whispers to him though there are no words for a child this age, no explanation for what has been done and yet what the child will never recall from memory will always be known by him and he will carry it as poison in the blood.Some reviewers complain about the oddity of Paul Lynch's style which is quite unusual indeed. For me, it was definitely this novel's forte. It blends detailed realistic descriptions with dreams and snippets of prose poetry. Prophet Song crushed me almost physically. I owe it a sleepless night. Maybe the concentration of bleakness and darkness in this novel is exaggerated. Sometimes it felt overwhelming, almost insufferable. On the other hand, this book is a clear warning and warnings are seldom whispered or painted with watercolours. It doesn’t take a prophet to foresee that Paul Lynch’s novel will make it to the Booker shortlist and may not stop there.Pablo Picasso, Mother and Child, c. 1951.",5.0
37,Recursion,Memory makes reality.,4.16,"['June', '11,', '2019']","Congratulations for winning of best sci-fi category from goodreads choice awards 2020! This is one of my favorite books of the year! Five OMG I’m suffering from brain cells bleeding and explosion of my last standing grey cells, what the hell I just read and who am I ? stars!I know the drill but let me rephrase one more time! This is not an easy, soft, sunshine and rainbows reading! In my opinion people who are brave enough to dive into this journey should put themselves an IQ test and discover their cognitive skills. ( luckily I read the quantum physics for dummies before the beginning but I feel like I can be great cast for future dumb and dumber movie if they will ever produce the third installment)So this book is amazing combination of time traveling, alternated lifetimes, Minority Reports meet Groundhog Day versus Black Mirror and Back to the Future kinda fascinating science fiction crashes into thriller and romance starting with an effective and memorable suicide attempt scene. A woman suffers from FMS ( false memory syndrome) who thinks her child was being erased, her husband denied her existence so there was nothing better than jump and end her life. But she had small hope in her heart, her husband could come to rescue her but when he didn’t show up, she didn’t want to fight anymore and.... Yes, this book starts with jaw dropping scene and you’re hooked! It’s addictive, unputdownable, nerve damaging, exhausting ride! You wanna know what’s going to happen and think about yourself if I had a chance to save my loved ones by turning back and making my wrongs turn into rights, what would happen! Saving her daughter from the traffic accident, curing your mother’s Alzheimer disease, prevention of school shooting , saving soldiers from the terrorist attacks are just the samples writer show as in alternative realities that have possible to be changed! The difference of Recursion from Dark Matter might be romance parts because I really enjoyed Barry and Helena’s love story. Not only they fought to bring universe into the right pattern but also they fought to get back together to be each other’s final word, everlasting love, end game!

38,The First to Die at the End,,4.02,"['October', '4,', '2022']","lmao i finished this masterpiece and now i’ve been staring at walls for hours just thinking about what i just read.just like “they both die at the end” this prequel has multiple narrators but the main ones are Orion and Valentino. and they are some of the most real and deep characters. the timeline for their story is when Death Cast is being introduced and tried for the first time. we see a lot of doubt within almost every character for the trueness of the death cast system. like “does it actually work?” , “there’s gotta be errors in the system,” as many think. it was even more interesting reading from the pov of the death cast creator, Joaquin.just like TBDATE this one was emotional and bittersweet towards the end. tears soaking the page type of shit. i will say, i appreciated how this work wasn’t a repetition of TBDATE, it fully stands on its own as a unique story set in the death cast world. the writing is captivating. and obviously fans of TBDATE will love this but surprisingly i can also see people that didn’t like that book like this oneand side note but we get 1 Mateo and Rufus pov in this one and i fully trained my brain into believing that they’re still breathing alive and well 🤧🤧🤧",5.0
39,The Testaments,,4.19,"['September', '10,', '2019']","I guess I'll have to be the one who says what nobody else is willing to say. This novel is terrible, and Booker judges are starstruck, hype-driven sellouts. And that no professional literary critic has the guts to tell the truth about how poorly conceived and written The Testaments is, is a true shame.  I can't decide which work Atwood should be embarrassed for more - Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 or The Testaments. The book doesn't read like a novel written by one of the most lauded authors of the 20st century. The Testaments reads like a standard-issue feminist YA dystopia, filled with every overused dystopian trope and every stereotype, penned by an author who writes for teen audience, and is published by Harper Teen. As such, it undoubtedly has some appeal to a part of Atwood's readership, but literary merit The Testaments has none. If this book had a different name on it, I would have DNFed it after 50 pages for its lack of originality, predictability and mediocre writing style. I’ve read a fair number of similar novels, I am not opposed to them, I enjoyed some of them, and some of them (for example the upcoming The Grace Year) held my attention much better. As an Atwood novel, The Testaments gets one disappointed, angry, heart-broken star from me. Why did the publishers embargo Atwood's new creation, I wonder? Surely there is nothing to spoil. Maybe to conceal its poor execution, or its transparent, shallow, simplistic, and ridiculous plot? The story is told from 3 POVs - Aunt Lydia's and two teen girls' - one growing up in Gilead and another - in Canada. Oh my, who those girls might be? Twist! You can only glimpse Atwood's former brilliance in Aunt Lydia's POV, but just for a few moments here and there. If the whole novel was written about Aunt Lydia, maybe Atwood would have made her journey more convincing, but alas. The other two girls are quintessential YA dystopian heroines - one abused by an evil oppressive regime, and the other - a bratty teen on the run from bad people, but who nevertheless has time for some romance. Yum! Like I said, these POVs are so similar to what's been regurgitated over and over in teen publishing, it's uncanny. Has The Testaments been partially ghost-written by Lauren Oliver? I am not trying to dump on Oliver, she has her fans and her place in the industry, but I expected something infinitely more sophisticated from Margaret Atwood.The new information about Gilead Atwood promised? Well, new details of Gilead made the regime more nonsensical and less plausible than ever before. Who benefits from living in Gilead becomes unfathomable in this book, thus making the entire concept pointless (kind of like in Wither). Totalitarian regimes work, at least temporarily, because they are supported by a mass of true believers. Where are they in this book? But if you yearn for some more torture porn in addition to that supplied by the 3 seasons of the TV show, then sure. Rapists, molesters, killers, suicide victims galore, plus solitary confinement - there is an overabundance of that. All of it written bluntly, rashly, exploitatively and without any kind of nuance. There is no overarching theme in The Testaments except GILEAD IS BAD. The plot to overthrow it is a joke. If you are looking for a clever, thoughtful, well-written companion to The Handmaid's Tale, you are out of luck. If you want a bland, basic TV show fanfic stuffed with action adventure and genre tropes, enjoy! The Testaments was written just for you.",1.0

Extinction,
 Douglas Preston combines a technothriller with a police investigation. Erebus Resort occupies a large valley in Eagle County, Colorado, deep in the Rocky Mountains. It offers guests the unique experience of viewing six herbivores, including woolly mammoths, Irish Elk, and giant ground sloths, brought back from extinction through genetic manipulation. When billionaire Rolf Gunnerson’s son Mark and his wife Olivia are abducted while in the Erebus back county, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation is called in to help the Eagle County sheriff’s department. This is Agent in Charge Frances Cash’s first case after her promotion to senior detective. She liaises with Sheriff James Colcord to investigate and tract down the culprits.The characterization is excellent in this novel. Cash is organized, detailed, goal-oriented, aggressive, foul-mouthed at times, sharp-tonged, and doesn’t like small talk. She’s viewed by her boss, McFaul, as lacking the public relations side of things and only being focused on solving her cases. Colcord is a movie buff, quiet, treats others with respect, and gets along with most people. However, he can also be forceful and take charge of situations.The author has penned a thriller with action, wonderful animals, plenty of adventure, great lead characters, and genetic engineering that is frightening, exciting, and thought-provoking. This riveting and suspenseful story kept be fully engaged from beginning to end. The plot is twisty with several shocking turns that caught me by surprise. The world-building was excellent from the back-country to the resort lodge to the laboratory. Themes include genetic engineering, deception, betrayal, death, greed, morality, work relationships, and much more.Overall, the book is tense, gripping, and suspenseful. It kept me rapidly turning the pages to find out what would be uncovered next. With great characterization and world-building as well as a fast pace, it’s also thought-provoking and terrifying at times. The afterward at the end of the book has some interesting information as well. I highly recommend this novel to those who enjoy thrillers, police procedurals, near-science science fiction, and mysteries. I hope there is a sequel. I purchased a copy of this novel.

No, I mean Murderbot is back in a solid novella. While I’m contractually bound to not repeat the approximately 80 highlights I made while reading, I can assure you that it is filled with ‘Bot’s trademark sarcastic thoughts on humans, slow thought processes, and complicated facial expressions.""Oh good, maybe the security level would go from barely adequate to mostly adequate. I didn't make an expression because I knew Indah would be more annoyed by me not reacting than by me reacting.""In Fugitive Telemetry, ‘Bot is on Preservation Station and has recently discovered a dead–cough, deceased–human. This is odd, because they appear murdered on a station with a threat assessment of 7% “(to make it drop lower than that we’d have to be on an uninhabited planet.)” ‘Bot jumps right into the investigation, spurred on by concern that GrayCris might be involved. In this case, it’s somewhat constrained from using full capabilities due to general unfriendliness of the human Station Security team and its honor system. It has some new humans to work with, although a few of our familiar friends make an appearance. In timeline terms, it takes place before Network Effect.I received notice of my ARC approval after a marathon day vaccinating people (10 stations, 573 people, thank you all very much for getting shots), and while fulfilled, was quite exhausted. I waged a brief debate with myself: do I crash in bed? Do I save it as a reward after I write my two other reviews and finish my two other less-interesting books? Or do I go for it?I think you know what I did.While I read, my day fell away, page by page, replaced by sarcastic observations and extremely dry wit. ‘Bot, how I’ve missed you. “I hadn’t had as much relevant experience in that time. But what I did have were thousands of hours of category mystery media, so I had a lot of theoretical knowledge that was possibly anywhere from 60 to 70 percent inaccurate shit.”The only real question was how long until I re-read all the novellas? Endless thanks to Netgalley and Tor/Forge Books for an ebook ARC. All thoughts are mine (although if you like, we can have a philosophical debate on that one) and all quotes are subject to change.Re-read 10/23 with Nataliya: this is such a tight little tale.

Random in Death
 by J. D. Robb (pseudonym for Nora Roberts). This well-written futuristic police procedural is set in New York City (NYC) in the summer of 2061 and features Lieutenant Eve Dallas with the NYC homicide police department. Sixteen-year-old Jenna Harbough has finally gotten parental approval to watch her favorite band play live at a club. Her idol Jake Kincaid catches her eye while she’s on the dance floor. It’s the best night of her life. Minutes later she stumbles outside and dies. Eve is called to the scene. Was Jenna targeted specifically or was she a random victim?Time spent with Dallas, Roarke, Delia Peabody (Eve’s partner), and Eve’s colleagues is always entertaining. The main characters are compelling and three-dimensional. Eve is honorable, honest, has strong moral principles, and has a strong sense of duty to victims and their families. Her need to serve and protect comes through in every book, but the underlying impetus for this is best understood by reading this series in order. As always, the interactions between Eve and Roarke are enjoyable and bring a different facet of Eve’s personality to light. It’s fascinating to see how Eve’s mind works getting a better and better picture of the killer. I enjoyed seeing Peabody continue to take on more responsibility in this story line as well as Detective Jenkinson. Readers get to see a bit of the private lives of Peabody and her significant other, McNab. Additionally, Nadine Furst and Jake Kincade share more of the limelight in this novel.It is amazing that after fifty-eight books this author can still use prose to elicit a strong emotional response from readers. The novel has a deeply involved plot that is thought-provoking and tragic. Robb weaves humor into her novels, providing levity to offset some of the more serious and grim aspects of the story. She brings strong characters, great plots, wonderful relationships, and excellent pacing to the series. Woven through the novel are threads of caring for others, standing for victims, friendship, relationships, ego, justice, leadership, love, respect, and trust. Additionally, there are themes of murder, shock, denial, grief, power, rage, dominance, punishment, arrogance, and much more.Robb is an excellent storyteller who combines a creative plot with suspenseful scenes, lots of solid police investigation, and some action. The writing is fluid and the ever-present threat that was looming kept me rapidly turning the pages. Besides the investigation, Dallas’s solid investigative techniques and her relationships with her friends and colleagues drive the narrative. It has the right balance of mystery, police investigation, romance, and creative twists.Overall, this novel was a twisty tale with great characterization that kept me engaged throughout the story. If you enjoy engaging near-future police procedurals, then I recommend this series. This is the fifty-eighth book in the In Death Eve Dallas series and I have read all of them up to this point. I can’t wait to read the next book in the series.St. Martin’s Press and J.D. Robb provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.

45,Dune,,4.27,"['June', '1,', '1965']","In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building.",5.0
46,Ender’s Game,,4.31,"['January', '15,', '1985']","DNF at 52%Dear Orson Scott Card,There are over 3,310,480,700 women in this world.Sincerely, Women. Dear Fans of This Book Who Are Probably About To Make An Angry Comment On This Review:Please leave now if you don't want to get all huffy and insulted and make a comment defending the author or whatever other shit that is this book. Or, if you want, go ahead. If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments. Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you. Sincerely, Kat. First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_... )). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels. Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star. But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;""All the boys are organized into armies.""""All boys?""""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.""Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence. 1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?  2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass? This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes. CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings. Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won. WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell. To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes. Plot Towards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, ""Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns."" Sure. Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they are not fucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power. It--just--ugh. It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.",1.0
47,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,,4.23,"['October', '12,', '1979']","In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about ""the author's personality"" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References"".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.",5.0
48,The Martian,,4.42,"['September', '27,', '2011']","I’m pretty much fucked.
Ok, show of hands. How many of you have uttered these exact words? (or words to that effect). Not everyone? I see we have some liars out there. How many have said them at least twice? Three times? Four? Those with hands still up, you probably need to make some adjustments to your approach, find a safer line of work, hobbies that do not entail long drops, stop trying the weekly specials at McBlowfish, or seek out people to date who are into less extreme…um…sports. These are the opening words of The Martian. Astronaut Mark Watney is definitely more screwed than most of us have ever been. Dude missed his ride and there will not be another along for, oh, four years. Supplies on hand were only meant to cover a few weeks, maybe months. And that Martian atmosphere is definitely no fun, lacking stuff like, oh, breathable air, and a reasonable range of temperature. It does, offer, however, extremely harsh (good for scouring that burned on gunk from sauce pans) and long-lasting (as in months) dust storms. And if that was not enough he faces an array of other challenges. unfriendly locals No, Kibby (the 12-year-old kibitzer who infects my brain), no Mars Attacks brain beasts, or that other guy, even though I know he is your favorite. Real challenges. For example, the music he has for his stay consists of disco. The viewing options include 70s TV. Most of us might give serious consideration to minimizing the guaranteed pain, frustration, starvation and inevitable death by, maybe, taking a short hustle outside sans that special suit. It would be a very, very short last dance. Watney is either a cock-eyed optimist or an idiot. I'm going with the former, as he is indeed made of the right stuff. He is armored and well supplied with the sort of can-do designer genes that might make the rest of us feel like the can’t-do sorts we are. He is the poster boy for positive attitude. It does not hurt that he is way smart, with expertise in a wide-enough range of things scientific to matter. It does not hurt that he is an engineer who gets off on taking apart, putting back-together, figuring out, thinking through, testing, trying, and pushing envelopes. But his crew is headed home, and what hope is there, really?The Martian tells of Watney’s attempt to survive in a literally alien environment, using only the tools on hand and his wits. It is a gripping story with one of the most adorable heroes you are likely to encounter, on this planet or any other. (No, Kibby, not a kitten) How could you not root for a guy who scrapes through Thanksgiving dinner for potato parts to plant for food? Of course, one might think “been there, done that,” particularly as 1964’s  Robin Crusoe on Mars  offered a retelling of Daniel Defoe’s classic tale in a more contemporary notion of a remote locale. A 1905 novel used a different classic traveler in the same sort of format. Of course those tellings had a lot more in common with the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs as seen by Frank Frazetta than they do with the vision we have of the Red Planet today, or, say, reality. RealityOr is it?One of these was a shot of you know where. The other was taken at Death Valley, which was used, BTW, in the filming of Robinson Crusoe on MarsMost of the tale is spent on Watney’s very compelling attempt to survive, going through all the challenges he faces trying to make air, preserve and maybe generate water, make his food last, get some sort of communication set up, deal with things like exploding air-locks, biblical level dust-storms, toppling ground-transport vehicles, you know, stuff, most of it life-threatening. The other end of things is how the folks on the ground deal with this GInornous OOPS. There are technical elements, of course but more interesting, for me, were the political considerations. To tell the crew or not? Imagine how bummed out, embarrassed, and guilty you might be on that ship (the Hermes) returning home, knowing you had left one behind. Might it affect your ability to take care of necessary business for the next bunch of months? Another question is whether to tell the public, and if so, when. How about getting help from other space-capable nations? Are any international dealings simple? There is also some in-house (NASA) staff maneuvering that is wonderful to see.Andy WeirIn her fabulous book on writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes
Having a likeable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud…
Probably the greatest strength of The Martian is the narration of Mark Watney. He is engaging and funny, optimistic and capable. I suppose there are some who might find him lacking in sharp edges, but I thought he worked great. Matt Damon as Mark Watney, enjoying the view  – from the film. The new earth-based shooting location was Wadi Rum, Jordan. I am sure they did plenty of color adjustments in post, but boy-o-boy does this place look like an alien landscape. GripesYes, really, there is too much scientific detail. It is not that it is beyond the comprehension of a lot of readers (although it will skip by a fair number) it is the share of time, the number of pages, the sheer volume of obstacles to be overcome, and the very detailed explanation of so many of them that tilts the book a bit too much towards the MacGyver demo. Weir writes very well about the other elements of the story. Repetition of DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, with the subsequent amazingly clever repair du jour, does get a bit old after a while. I had to fight an urge to scan at times. But that is really it. Otherwise, The Martian is an absolute delight to read. Watney is lovable as well as capable, and makes excellent use of his sense of humor to look on the bright side of life, in a very dark circumstance. Whether he makes it out on time or not (not gonna spoil that one) you will cheer him on, hope for the best, and fly past those pages with considerable, if maybe not interplanetary, speed. Is there life on Mars? There will be while you read this book. Review posted – 1/16/15 Updated and trotted out there again on release of the film - 10/2/15 This review has been cross-posted on my site, Cootsreviews.comPublication date – self-pub in 2011 – Bought, edited and published by Crown 10/28/2014PS - Saw the film on 10/9/15 and it kicks ass! Go see it if you haven't already. It is very true to the book, with the improvement of not getting bogged down in details, has a great cast, looks amazing and does a fantastic job of promoting science. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal and FB pages. 5/24/16 - Weir wrote a short story prequel to The Martian, called Diary of an AssCan.

49,Ready Player One,"IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place.",4.23,"['August', '16,', '2011']","I originally gave this book 3 stars as harmless lightweight fun, but my opinion of it declined as time went by. Then after reading Armada I fully realized what a talentless one-trick hack that Cline really is so I changed this rating. Plus, his outraged hardcore fans kept coming on here and telling me that I missed the point since I didn't give it 5 stars so I might as well give them something to really be mad about. If you're one of those Cline fans who wants to whine about it in the comments I will just delete it and block you.Adventures in Time MowingAfter my laptop fused to my lawn mower due to a freak lightning strike, I discovered that I could use it to travel through time.“Wow, where’d you come from?”“I’m from 2011. Got a time mower and decided to come to the future. I’ll spare you the full origin story. My name’s Kemper.”“I’m Wade Watts. Welcome to 2044.”“Thanks. I gotta say, things are looking kind of grim around here. Are those mobile homes stacked up like hillbilly skyscrapers?”“Yeah, I live in one of them. We’ve had a lot of problems once the cheap fossil fuels started running out. Life kinda sucks ass these days. Fortunately, we’ve got the OASIS.”“What’s that?”“It’s this virtual reality that’s kind of a combination of the Internet and the biggest MMORPG ever made. Here put this on, and I’ll show you.”“Hey, this is pretty sweet, Wade. But what’s with all this old stuff here in your virtual room. It looks like the ‘80s vomited in here.”“Oh, it’s part of my research for the contest. See the guy who invented the OASIS was this old nerd named James Halliday. He left an Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS and whoever finds it wins the prize. He was totally obsessed with the ‘80s and nerdly stuff like computers, sci-fi, cartoons, movies, comics and video games. He left three keys to three gates hidden in here, and the clues have to be stuff that he loved. So a lot of people like me have to know all about the '80s to hunt for the egg.""“How long has this been going on?”“For years now. Nobody has found the first key yet.”“And you what? Watch movies from the ‘80s? Listen to the music? Read his favorite books? Play old video games?”“It‘s even bigger than that. Because of the contest, the entire world is obsessed with the ‘80s. The clothes and hairstyles are considered cool again.”“Really? Well, I gotta get the hell out of here then. Thanks for showing me this, Wade. How do I log out?”“You’re leaving already? Don’t you want to…Oh, my god! You said you were from 2011? And you’re in your 40s, right?”“Well, just barely…”“So you actually lived through the ‘80s?”“Afraid so. High school class of 1988.”“That’s awesome! You gotta tell me all about it, Kemper.”“Kid, why would you want to hear about that? You’re sitting here with enough computer power to download everything from the collected works of Shakespeare to the entire run of The Wire and you want to hear about the ’80s? Just for a contest?”“I love the ’80s. It was the coolest time ever!”“Uh, not really. In fact, I think the ’90s beat the shit out of them. That not worrying about the Cold War thing was a relief and the music was a lot better. Plus we got to wear flannel. That was fun.”“But… you got to play the old video games in the actual arcades, and you saw the first generation of home computers come out. Plus, music videos and John Hughes movies and Rubik’s Cubes and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album and….”“Yeah, Wade. I lived through it all. I remember when MTV played music videos and when Eddie Murphy was funny. But you’re making me sad, kid.”“Why?”“Lemme tell you a story, Wade. About ten years after I got out of high school, an old buddy I had stayed in touch with had a birthday bash and invited a bunch of us that used to run around together. So we’re at his house drinking and playing cards just like the old days and catching up and playing ‘Remember when?”. It was a lot of fun, but we’d been listening to hair metal and classic rock all night, and at one point, I was flipping through the CD’s.”“Actual CD’s! Not downloads?”“Hell, I’m so old even my post-high school stories are dated now. Yes, Wade, real CD’s. Anyhow, I found a new Foo Fighters album, and I put it in. And this one guy made a face and asked me why I had taken the Guns-n-Roses out. And I said something like the nostalgia had been fun but I needed something from that decade. Being completely serious he said that he didn’t know how I could listen to that stuff, and that he still listened to the same exact music we did in high school. He had just replaced his old cassettes with CD’s. The guy had completely managed to miss grunge and was perfectly happy with the same play list in 1998 that he’d been listening to in 1988. And that was one of the saddest things I ever heard, Wade.”“But maybe he just really liked that stuff.”“I liked it too, once upon a time. And I can still belt out a pretty good version of Relax when Frankie Goes to Hollywood comes on the radio, but it was a certain time and place. Now it’s done. I find it depressing that someone of Gen X would want to be stuck there and never moved on to anything new. But it got worse after that, Wade. Because we got older and then the media started catering to us by going for nostalgia trips on everything from trying to remake the Knight Rider TV show to shitty movies like The Transformers and G.I. Joe to the goddamn Smurfs. I’m tired of it in 2011, Wade. I don’t want a new Indiana Jones movie, I want the NEXT Indiana Jones. But no one is working on that because all of us got obsessed with regurgitating our childhoods over and over.”“That is kind of sad, Kemper.”“What’s even sadder is seeing it happen to a generation that didn’t even live through it. When I was a teenager, I got sick to death of baby boomer nostalgia and there’d be these kids my age who tried to be like damn dirty hippies by wearing tie-dye shirts and going to listen to Grateful Dead tribute bands. They were nostalgic for an era that wasn’t even theirs, and I always thought it was a waste. Don’t be like that, Wade. You seem like a nice kid. Don’t sit here watching Family Ties reruns and playing Space Invaders and making jokes about Ewoks. That was then. This is now. It’s your time and you should be out there trying to find the stuff that will become part of your own memories of growing up, not rehashing ours.”“Gee, Kemper. That’s a really good point. You’ve opened my eyes. Thanks a lot.”“You’re welcome, Wade. By the way, what the hell was this prize that was so good that it got the entire world doing the safety dance again?”“Oh, the winner gets the controlling interest in Halliday’s company and his personal fortune which is about $240 billion dollars.”“Did you say $240 billion? Dollars?”“Yes, so how about we log off. Maybe I’ll take a walk and see if I can find this girl I like. I’ve been…”“Screw that. Fire this rig up, Wade. Put on some Def Leppard and find me a pair of acid washed jeans and some high top Reeboks. Let’s start looking for clues. For $240 billion I’ll live through the ‘80s again.”**************************************************I didn’t actually hate this book. It did a lot of very clever stuff regarding an entire virtual universe. And for a member of Gen X, it was a fast and fun romp down memory lane. It was kind of like Snow Crash meets the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie.But I’ve got a personal pet peeve against people trying to live in the past and since this book is nostalgia porn*, the basic premise did rub me the wrong way. The idea that the kids of the 2040s are just watching episodes of ‘80s TV shows and playing Donkey Kong really kind of depressed me. *I stole that phrase from Flannery’s review. Sorry, Flannery! It was just too good.I might have been able to get past it a little easier if at least one of the kids said something like, “Jesus, I hate this ‘80s bullshit. I can’t wait until his freakin’ contest is over so I can live in the here and now.” But instead all of them treat it like it’s the greatest entertainment ever. So even though a few post ’80s things like Firefly or the Lord of the Rings movies get mentioned, we’re supposed to believe that nerd pop culture reached a zenith in the ’80s and nothing worth geek obsession happened between 1990 and 2040? Sorry, but that seems kind of unlikely and the kind of wishful thinking that an aging Gen Xer would write as he pines for his glory days.",1.0
50,Fahrenheit 451,"Sixty years after its original publication, Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 stands as a classic of world literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. Today its message has grown more relevant than ever before.",3.97,"['October', '19,', '1953']","As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in ""their day"" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre. Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):""In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.""I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of ""people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books"", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing.",2.0

52,The Hunger Games,"Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?",4.34,"['September', '14,', '2008']","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
53,Brave New World,,3.99,"['January', '1,', '1932']","I need to parse my rating of this book into the good (or great), the bad and the very  fugly because I thought aspects of it were inspired genius and parts of it were dreggy, boring and living near the border of awful. In the end, the wowness and importance of the novel's ideas as well as the segments that I thoroughly enjoyed carried the book to a strong 3.5 star rating.THE REALLY GOOD/EXCELLENT - I loved the first third of the book in which the basic outline of the ""Brave New World"" and its devalued, conveyer belt morality is set forth. The narrative device employed by Huxley of having the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning provide a walking tour to students around the facility as a way to knowledge up the reader on the societal basics was perfect. We learn of the cloning/birthing process, the caste system and the fundamental tenets upon which the society is organized.

This was as good a use of infodumping exposition as I had come across in some time and I was impressed both with the content and delivery method. The reader gets a crash course in world and its history in a way that fit nicely into the flow of the narrative without ever feeling forced. This was easily the best part of the novel for me, and Huxley's mass production-based society of enforced hedonism and anti-emotion was very compelling. Sort of like... 

Now, long jumping to the end of the novel...I also thought the final ""debate"" near the story's climax between John (the ""savage"") and Mustapha Mond, the World Controller, was exceptional. This last chapter/ending of the book, while abrupt, was masterful and struck the proper chord with the overall theme of the book. Thus, a superior 4.5 to 5.0 stars for this portion of the book. THE BAD/AWFUL - I thought the middle of the book including both the trip to the ""reservation"" and John's initial return to London was a sleeping pill and felt disconnected from the rest of the narrative. Throughout this entire portion of the book, all I kept thinking was...

The only purpose of this long, long.....LONG section seems to be to allow the reader to see Bernard Marx do a complete 180 in his views on the society once he finds himself in the role of celebrity by virtue of his relationship with John the savage. Sorry, this just did not strike me as a big enough payoff for this dry, plodding section. It was a test of endurance to get through this portion of the book, so I'm being generous when I give it a weak 2.0 to 2.5 stars. I could just have easily summed it up by just saying...

Bottom-line, I think this is a book that should be read. It's important book and there is much brilliance here. Plus, it is short enough that the stale boring segments aren't too tortuous to get through. However, as far as the triumvirate of classic dystopian science fiction goes...1984 is still the undisputed champ.3.0 Stars. Recommended.",3.0
54,Foundation,"The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series",4.17,"['August', '30,', '1951']","Honestly, I don't get why this book/series is so popular. There are some interesting elements to it (for instance, the use of religion as a tool of mass control and the implicit resultant argument that religion is no more than a fraud, ""the opiate of the people,"" after all), but the book gave me little to enjoy or dig into. The forces of the novel are broad, historical, dealing with masses of people; this means that there is little to no room for individual characters here and little to be done by the few characters who do appear. One leader says, in fact, in response to a crisis, the threat of warfare and annihilation, ""I'm going to do nothing. One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis"" (191). This is a recurring theme. Plus, there are no female characters to speak of. One man's wife makes a brief and apparently unnecessary appearance for a page-long chapter, but that's it. All else is done by and to men.There are a couple of minor things I do like about the book. One is Salvor Hardin's statement that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" which I like for its endorsement of nonviolent alternatives. Another is the characters' habit of saying ""Space"" or ""Galaxy"" instead of God when they exclaim or curse.",2.0
55,How to Solve Your Own Murder,,3.86,"['March', '26,', '2024']","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0

58,The Mystery Writer,,3.44,"['March', '1,', '2024']","I have a habit of automatically requesting books from authors that I have enjoyed before-often without even reading the premise! Next year, I will have to be more discerning, and start reading the synopsis to determine if the particular story is REALLY a fit for me, despite past positive experiences with the author!Had I done so in this case, (and the synopsis really shares too much!) I wouldn’t have requested this book, as I know that I rarely enjoy a story about conspiracy theories or the people who believe in them. But, that wasn’t the only issue I had with this book…**Theo Benton has left the University she has been attending, convinced that her career path as an attorney is the wrong path for her, and shown up on her brother's doorstep in Kansas with two suitcases and an unfinished novel.She decides to finish her book at cafe/bar called “Benders”, which happens to already have a highly successful “writer in residence”, Dan Murdoch, who quickly becomes her mentor-until he is brutally murdered.Could his senseless death have anything to do with the Conspiracy Theories he has been researching?Was he involved or is there another agenda at work? Theo is determined to find out.Unfortunately, despite her good intentions, I could not connect with Theo, who comes across as a weepy, naive “damsel in distress” who needs continual rescuing from her brother Gus, and his friend and associate, Mac, whose family are “Doomsday Preppers”.Another issue-as written, you would believe that all Americans run around armed with a gun.In addition, despite 400 pages, the last 30% uses SEVERAL abrupt time jumps, to move the story to its denouement, making the ending feel extremely rushed. (and over the top)“After She Wrote Him” earned 4 stars from me, and “The Woman in the Library” earned 5 stars and a place on my FAVORITE READS shelf for 2022, so I am sure this is a one off and I am still looking forward to seeing what Sulari Gentill pens next.

59,Floating Hotel,"This cozy debut science fiction novel tells a story of misfits, rebels, found family—and a mystery that spans the stars.",3.78,"['March', '19,', '2024']","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

60,Off the Air,,3.14,"['March', '26,', '2024']","Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, who splits her time between covering general interest assignments and working on special projects. Her most recent interview was with Larry Lemmon, “America’s true conservative voice”- and a controversial radio talk show host who was best known for his stance on pushing for a border wall, even before Trump did.When word gets out about a death at Lemmon’s radio station, KFRK, Jolene and Nate Thompson, her photographer, rush to the scene-hoping to be able to report the facts first.This could be a career-making story.When the body is identified as Larry Lemmon, Jolene hopes that because she conducted his final interview, it would give her and her station an advantage. But as she chases the story, she finds herself always one step behind her nemesis, JJ, who reports for a rival station.Colleagues and those with different political views, were just a few of the people who might want Lemmon dead. But who actually followed through with his murder?Emmy Award winning reporter Cristina Estes is a Tony Hillerman Prize winner for this debut in the “Best First Mystery set in the Southwest” category-but I had a few problems with it.It is chock full of facts past and present about my home State- Arizona, highlighting the good, the bad, and the ugly. (Mostly the last two, but I guess that is what reporters see more of)It is also so loaded with facts about how reporting has changed over the years from just reporting a story and competing for ratings, to competing for clicks on Social Media, and racing to be the first to “tweet” a breaking story.So much so, that the story often reads more like an expose on the “cut throat day in the life of a journalist”- than as fiction-and the over abundance of facts took me out of the story, and slowed down the pace.

61,A Grave Robbery,"Veronica and Stoker discover that not all fairy tales have happy endings, and some end in murder, in this latest historical mystery from New York Times bestselling and Edgar Award–nominated author Deanna Raybourn.",4.25,"['March', '12,', '2024']","It's no secret that I ADORE the Veronica Speedwell series. When @prhaudio #prhaudiopartner granted me freeaccess to the audiobook of 𝐀 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐑𝐎𝐁𝐁𝐄𝐑𝐘 (PUB 03.12) early I threw all other plans aside and pressed play.I LOVE this series and this is a new favorite! I think that audio is the BEST way to experience this engaging historical mystery adventure of Speedwell and Stoker. This installment is dedicated to the audiobook narrator, Angele Masters, and her voice is masterful perfection. She has become the voice of Veronica and it's magic to my ears.(Yes- you must read them in order.)I was smiling and laughing within the first 2 minutes. I loved this installment so so much. As with any great series, I find great comfort in returning to these well-known, well-loved characters. I love seeing the character's relationship evolve. After 8 books, I was surprised to find myself swooning over Speedwell and Stoker in a fresh, new way. Tender and tenacious. Veronica Speedwell is my favorite kind of character: smart, quick-tongued, vivacious, and loyal. She knows who she is and won't sacrifice that based on anyone's expectations. She is full of moxie and gumption. I wish I could join her for a glass of aguardiente as she regales me with tales of her and Stoker's latest mystery.(P.S.- Stoker's not bad either) #speedwellandstoker4lifeDeanna Raybourn has this magical ability to bring the mystery to life through both her writing and storytelling style. And oh my goodness- she has impeccable word choice. I find myself marking ‘new-to-me’ words that have me running to the dictionary and wondering how I can work them into conversation.",5.0
62,The Extinction of Irena Rey,"From the International Booker Prize–winning translator and Women's Prize finalist, a propulsive, beguiling novel about eight translators and their search for a world-renowned author who goes missing in a primeval Polish forest.",3.41,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Jennifer Croft’s droll, brainteaser of a novel slowly shifts into the realms of the absurd. Like characters from Agatha Christie, eight translators are summoned to an isolated house on the edge of an ancient, Polish forest. Once there, their host, world-famous author Irena Rey, inexplicably vanishes, leaving her eight translators to work out what’s happened – and if it might happen to them too. The book we’re presented with is an account of their experiences and attempts to find Rey. It’s written by one of the eight - at first known only by her translation language Spanish, later as Emi. However, there’s a complication, the version of Emi’s autofictional piece on offer here is actually a translation from Polish to English. A translation carried out by English aka Alexis, another of the eight, and a character in Emi’s book. Alexis’s introduction makes it clear she considers Emi’s version of events highly suspect, casting doubt on her reliability as a narrator. But Alexis’s framing is also somewhat self-serving - since she’s obviously unhappy about her portrayal here - so could it actually be Alexis who’s unreliable? It’s a conundrum we’re left to ponder. Emi recounts the eight’s arrival at Rey’s house, she’s distraught that the once-luminous Irena now seems close to abject, apparently abandoned by her husband, and oddly tight-lipped about her new book Grey Eminence previously billed as her magnum opus. There’s a pervasive sense of foreboding, intensified by an ill-fated, expedition to nearby Białowieża Forest, a brooding, primeval place with a sinister history. The house too has a gothic feel despite its Japanese, organic design, filled with strange artefacts, it’s a veritable cabinet of curiosities. In Alexis’s translation, Emi’s style seems unintentionally amusing, mannered and bordering on archaic at times. But is this an accurate reflection of Emi’s writing or a parody that furthers Alexis’s agenda? Or could it be that Alexis just isn’t a very competent translator? Alexis muddies the waters even further by interweaving Emi’s text with detailed footnotes that veer between clarification, exasperation and outright intervention. It’s a move worthy of Borges, whose influence is detectable throughout Jennifer Croft’s novel. Borges alongside half-buried allusions to writers like Poe and Henry James, the interplay between Emi and Alexis, Emi’s excessive reverence for Rey as author of near-sacred work versus Alexis’s more pragmatic stance, all point to Croft’s underlying concerns. Croft’s intent on exploring and contesting popular notions of authorship and meaning, relations between author and translator. Croft is known for her award-winning translations, and her novel bears distinct traces of the Polish literature she’s most famous for - particularly Olga Tokarczuk’s fiction, there’s more than a hint of Gombrowicz here too. Croft challenges traditional binaries, divides between author and translator and also, through Białowieża Forest, nature and culture. Białowieża is a unique place that Croft’s visited more than once, it sustains a rich diversity of flora, fauna and wildlife, some no longer exist anywhere but there. Croft deliberately sets her story in 2017, a time when the Forest came under threat from extensive logging projects as a result of changes in government policy. Croft uses the Forest and Rey’s character to introduce wider questions around ecology, climate change and art in a time of extinction. Rey’s new book revolves around many of these issues including whether or not art is an essentially destructive force. They’re intriguing questions although not ones that Croft always fully, or entirely convincingly, addresses. Croft unites her interest in ecology and authorship by drawing on ideas circulating in literary, queer and feminist theory. She inserts a series of puzzling references and reflections on the fungi and lichen found throughout the forest - often regarded as discrete organisms, now understood as part of a collective, an inter-sustaining network of living things. Croft has dubbed translation a kind of ‘superlichen’ a process of interconnection and collaboration, embedded in a wider literary and cultural ecosystem. An understanding of translation which deeply troubles established notions of the author as celebrity or individual with a unique, authorial voice – an idea of authorship modelled by Emi in Croft’s narrative through Emi’s hyperbolic regard for Rey and her work. Croft’s novel of ideas is often entertaining and thought-provoking, but it can also be essayistic, dense and overpacked: Croft can't resist including commentaries on topics ranging from publishing culture to rising racism and xenophobia in Europe. I had mixed reactions to this one, it’s well-crafted and I admired its ambition. But it also felt a bit stretched out, overly long, and quite laboured at times – there are a number of points where the plot is too transparently operating as a vehicle for Croft’s ideas.

64,The Other Lola,What happens when the people you love the most are the people you can trust the least?,3.65,"['March', '12,', '2024']","The Other Lola is a follow-up to the 2023-release, Missing Clarissa. These are YA-Mystery stories following two main characters: Blair and Cam.In Missing Clarissa, Cam and Blair investigate the disappearance of popular cheerleader, Clarissa Campbell, who went missing from their small town of Oreville, Washington, 20-years before.It starts as a project for their high school Journalism class and ends up being a viral podcast, as well as a life-endangering pursuit of amateur sleuthing.At the end of the Clarissa case, Cam and Blair had sudden fame, but with it, a lot of unwanted attention. They vowed to never do it again; to stick their noses in where they don't belong, to make a podcast, none of it.Then they meet Mattie, a Freshman at their high school. Mattie shows up on the literal doorstep, begging for the girls' help with an unsettling family situation.Mattie's sister, Lola, disappeared mysteriously five years ago. The thing is, Lola has returned. She's not talking about where she has been all these years, and Mattie is convinced she's an imposter, but no one else believes Mattie; not her mother, not her brother, Luke, no one.Blair and Cam, Blair in particular, are moved by Mattie's story. They seem so passionate about it. It couldn't hurt to help them out, could it? Look into it a little...Before they know it, the two are neck deep in another dangerous investigation, but with secrets between them, how will they ever be able to get to the bottom of someone else's twisted family drama? I was intrigued by this initially, and did enjoy following Cam and Blair during the investigation. For me, it wasn't quite as compelling as the first book, but yeah, still a solid story.The audiobook has great narration and I would recommend that format. I was able to fly through this story and I did find that the narrator helped to keep me engaged, even when I was rolling my eyes a little bit.I felt like, and I could be misremembering, but for me, personal issues for Blair and Cam took much more of a front seat in this one than the first book. In a way, this almost felt like a straight YA Contemporary story, with a slight mystery happening in the background.By this I mean, the mystery almost took a back seat to Cam and Blair's interpersonal dramas. With this being said though, I do really enjoy both Cam and Blair as characters and I love their friendship. So, it's not like I was disappointed with those aspects of the story, it just seemed more difficult to get as invested in the mystery surrounding Lola because of it.Additionally, there were things at the end that I found unsatisfying; that just didn't make sense. I am mainly referring to the events following the big reveal, so sadly, I can't comment more without giving the ending away.Overall though, I still enjoyed Cam and Blair, their friendship and the idea of two smart high school girls taking on the world and solving mysteries. That's a fun concept, which is fairly well executed within these stories.There are hints that there could be more with these characters in the future. I would be interested in picking up future books, if that turns out to be the case.Thank you to the publisher, Wednesday Books and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copy to read and review.

She is always passed by when it comes to promotions at the school because she is a woman. Kate is a real go getter and an achiever. That’s why when one of her students got arrested for murder Kate wasn’t afraid to go all out to prove his innocence even if he was a trouble maker in the class room.This Author never disappoints This Reader. Amanda Flower is my favorite Cozy mystery Author. The book was well researched and I thought it was a delightful introduction of a new series.

Don't fear the reaper...
Tru doesn't know what that message means when she finds it...but with the unsolved mysteries and murders in Mount Orange's past, she KNOWS it can't be good. Aside from losing her sister tragically years ago, Tru has also been saddened and fascinated by the unsolved murders of two teen girls, Bailey and Celeste, and would LOVE to use the resources at her newspaper job to dig down deep into the cold cases...because there's something inside her that tells her that SHE is meant to find the truth...but 
why?
Tru is also hiding a secret from her longtime boyfriend and family...not only does she not plan to go to college with him at FSU in the fall...she's not even sure if this 'perfect' relationship feels right to her anymore. Her one solace is diving, and Tru spends a LOT of her time exploring the deep and looking for answers at the bottom of the water. Enter Rio, a fascinating, beautiful, and mysterious fellow diver, who appears seemingly out of nowhere...and forms an INSTANT bond with Tru.As the two become fast friends, their feelings start to spill into uncharted territory...and Rio reveals that she too feels a pull towards the Bailey and Celeste murders. The girls almost feel as though they were CALLED to this dark exploration...and when they start to reveal facts that only Bailey and Celeste could have known, and an indescribable feeling that they've known each other for many years in a very intimate way...the pieces seem to slowly be coming together. But when they find the aforementioned ""Don't fear the reaper"" note tacked to their tent one night, and hear terrifying sounds in the woods that same evening...it seems like the girls have stumbled upon dangerous information...information SOMEONE would kill to keep hidden. Can Tru and Rio uncover the secret of Bailey and Celeste's demise...
before they get PERMANENTLY swallowed by the deep?
There is something so theatrical and yet accessible about Ginny Myers Sain's books, and with this one as my third read of hers, I've come to expect certain qualities when 'diving' into her stories. 😉 There will be murder, intrigue, the tortured push and pull of teenage friendships (and love stories!), and an atmosphere that ALWAYS leaps off the page...and thrusts me headlong into somewhere completely unexpected...and of COURSE, also very creepy! This time, we land in sunny Florida, and there is certainly enough detail here to bring to mind the almost oppressive humidity found only in the Sunshine State. In this one, Tru and Rio (no coincidence that this is her name, I'm sure! 🌊) also spend a great deal of time on dives and underwater, and these passages also brought the dark and terrifying nature of the Deep to life...and had me holding MY breath each time they went down!Although I enjoyed these two main characters enough, I have to say in this one...I almost felt like TOO many of the 'townsfolk' had been invited to the party. Lots of the characters also have very odd or uncommon names (Derry, for example...and don't get me started on John Boy! 😣) I know we needed a SOMEWHAT larger cast to provide 'suspects' and give some depth to the plot itself, but unlike some of Myers Sain's previous books, this time I felt VERY much like I was reading teenagers...who were acting a LOT like teenagers. Of course, this is fine: this book IS YA, after all. But with so much emphasis on smoking, uh, 'alternative substances', and of course the burgeoning romances (or eroding romances) between several of the characters, it felt like there was almost too much going on at times...and yet, not the sort of events and feelings I WANTED to learn more about as we went along.And then there's of course the paranormal element that is always present in Myers Sain's books, and it WAS present here...but in a muted, downplayed way. Part of this was I think intended to keep the reader guessing (and it absolutely worked!) but I have to admit after lots of buildup and the ENTIRELY unfair and tragic death of one character that I truly liked 😢 the denouement felt like a bit of a letdown and steered sharply away from the groundwork that Myers Sain had laid and the trail of breadcrumbs I had been following...and it's hard to say that I wasn't slightly disappointed. There is also a pretty heavy emphasis on the relationship (?) or not between Rio and Tru, so if you aren't into a bit of romance in your thrillers, I would steer clear.And as to whether Tru can 'tru-ly' trust Rio?It'll be up to YOU to revisit these lyrics after reading and see if they turn out to be true!Love of two is oneHere but now they're goneCame the last night of sadnessAnd it was clear she couldn't go on😳😉4 stars, rounded up from 3.5",4.0
70,The Housemaid's Secret,,4.26,"['February', '15,', '2023']","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

71,A Flicker in the Dark,,4.00,"['January', '11,', '2022']","I almost always give even the shittiest books at least two stars because the author I'm bashing wrote words and got them published. Good job. However, given that the story has already been optioned by Emma Stone, I don't think the author will be weeping into her labradoodle's fur over my piddly little review. So, fuck it. ONE STAR.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD""Psychology,"" I said. ""I'm hoping to pursue my PhD here next fall - then, eventually get my master's."" Reader, my eyes closed in pain. I'd like to call this an editorial error, but I think the main character is actually this stupid. I have a master's degree. I also have a doctorate. Which one do you think came first - the doctor designation, or the dusty, useless piece of paper my mom put in a frame? Hmm.Where to even start with this book? Chloe Davis, the human equivalent of hold music, is very deeply damaged. She's the daughter of a notorious serial killer, and she's done everything she can to separate herself from that life. Those efforts include the following: not changing her name, moving an hour away from her hometown, giving an interview on how her serial killer father inspired her career, ETC. Girlfriend, have you heard of Google? Everybody knows you. Your Ken-doll fiancé - yeah, you didn't have to reveal nothing, because other people know how the internet works.Yep, let's discuss Ken-doll: he throws you surprise parties even though he knows you freak out about everything. He unilaterally decides to throw in a little surprise choking during some nice, relaxing morning sex. (Didn't your father's victims die by choking? Huh. Tacky). Dude disappears all the time and you never really bother to ask where he is or what he's doing. Sounds super great. A nice healthy relationship. At least you can call in prescriptions in his name! (Apparently psychologists can do that in Louisiana --solidifying the decision to set the book here, because this girl would have never made it through medical school).Elevator music drug and alcohol problem: Look, I realize I'm more Hunter S. Thompson than most, but this D & A problem ain't really that bad. I work with lawyers and criminal defendants, and ALL of us are taking benzos legally or illegally and in much higher quantities than Princess Chloe here. You're worried ONE xanax is going to muck up your day? If you're really an addict, you'd have to take half the bottle to even notice you took anything. Two glasses of wine after a xanax, and you wake up not remembering what happened? Two xanax and you lose a DAY AND A HALF? This is some amateur shit right here. Our girl talks about having done all of this since college (10-12 years?) -- this is your tolerance? LEAVE THIS PARTY RIGHT NOW. Some other random thoughts: they find Valium in the first victim's hair follicles approximately two seconds after they find the body. What coroner on what earth is looking at a hair follicle test first thing? Those things take days to process in a best case scenario. They would use a blood test, a vitreous fluid test, maybe even a urine test if there was any remaining. I've sat through enough expert witness testimony to feel personally affronted by this scene. This inattention to detail covered the entire book. I understand we don't all need to know the science. But if you don't have the science, you need the characters. Ergo, if there is neither science nor character, you have a fucking snoozer, my friends. Who even needs the Xanax at this point. SHE SLEEPS WITH THE FAKE REPORTER MURDERER. God! Was the choking the day before not enough? Also, there was chocolate on a pillow at a Motel 6? Laugh out loud. This is like Blair from ""Gossip Girl"" trying to write ""poor.""Then, revelation time. Chloe has solved this puzzle! The dang murderer is obviously taking these girls to Chloe's childhood home. She also apparently used to know him, because he's from her home town. EYE ROLL. She is going to drive right to the house and not tell anyone about it. She is also going to leave her phone in the car because why would you need that? (Aside: a famous serial killer's house has been sitting empty for 20 years and it's somehow completely intact, not vandalized, burned down...?) In what world?Well, thankfully Dr. Brilliant Chloe remembers to take the gun into the house, even though she's never shot a gun in her life. Earlier in the book, she even rues the fact. ""Golly gee, I should really learn to shoot this thing."" But, in this perfect moment, the benzos have steadied her hands, and she shoots that dumb fucker reporter lover murderer right in the fatal spot. Deus ex 9mm.But, of course that's not the end, because the killer from 20 years ago was Chloe's weirdo brother. Did that surprise a single person who read this? The serial killer sitting in jail never actually did it, duh. Turns out those porno mags Cooper kept in his room really pushed him over the edge. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE. Cooper feels the darkness, he says. Yeah, dude. We all feel the fucking darkness. Take this bottle of xanax and work it out.The ending is Chloe arriving at her former(?) fiancé's sister's house. She drove to Mississippi to return the ring (certified mail anyone?), but she doesn't actually want to talk to Ken-doll. In retrospect, and aside from not asking permission for the choking, he wasn't so bad. He's a pharmaceutical rep and she's a drug ""addict."" Match made in heaven, DUH.Chloe's dad gets out of jail because, also, DUH. My only emotional response to that was that everyone should watch the show Rectify and forget they read this stupid fucking book. If my kid was murdering people, you better believe I wouldn't take a murder rap for that little psycho!

As soon as she comes back, murder case of Natalie Clark shakes the neighbor town Nappanee! Townies of Wakarusa already start criticizing the situation and another vandalizing attack happens at Jacobs’ front walls just like twenty years ago when their daughter has been kidnapped and killed.  Even though she’s sacked from her job at the newspaper because of emergency situation her uncle created has prevented her to write a good article about the murder investigation, she is adamant to dig out more to bring out the skeletons townies his in their closets which mean she also has to dig out her own past, learning secrets about her own family. The book’s progress is extra slow burn after the strong opening. The chapters were a little dragging. Because of the interesting topic I kept on reading and I was about to round up 3.5 stars to 4 but that abrupt, weird ending which force us fill the blanks to write our own ending was semi satisfying for me! Unfortunately I cut the half star and I decided to give three solid, it’s not very good but it’s still okay read stars!  I’m still interested in reading more future works of the author. It was still a promising start!

74,The Paris Apartment,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Guest List comes a new locked room mystery, set in a Paris apartment building in which every resident has something to hide…",3.66,"['February', '22,', '2022']","Meh. The Paris Apartment feels mostly like melodramatic dithering, but I guess I was somewhat entertained.Jess needs a place to stay, so she hits up her half brother. When she arrives at his residence, she finds a fancy building with questionable tenants, but no sign of Ben. As she digs deeper and asks around, she starts to realize that all is not as it seems at this apartment building. Dun dun dun!Having read a few of Lucy Foley's books, I feel like she's really good at building up anticipation. Every moment in this book is so dramatic, with dark shadows and scary sounds at every turn. That's all good, but after a while, it gets to be a bit much, you know? There's no natural ebb and flow in the tone. It's just all high anticipation, all the time.It doesn't help that every character acts so high-strung and paranoid, even when nothing is happening.
I watched as Nick's friend plucked a sprig of rosemary from one of the bushes, tearing hard to wrench it free. How he crushed it to his nose, inhaled. There was something presumptuous about the gesture. It felt like an act of vandalism.
What the heck. Who attacks a bush just to smell it? And who watches someone do that and calls it ""presumptuous""? Reader, if you're able to keep from rolling your eyes, you're a better person than I am.For a book advertised as a mystery, it sure doesn't feel like one. Jess doesn't so much suss out clues as she bumbles around, pilfering stuff, sticking her foot in her mouth, and just generally acts like an incompetent idiot. The other characters are all unlikable too, though each in their own way. And everyone is smelly, with stale breath and excessive sweat.After all that exaggerated writing, do the twists deliver? Eh, they seem pretty standard to me for the genre. I wasn't really surprised or shocked. In fact, it feels more ridiculous than anything else.Still, I was compelled to turn the pages, so I must've been somewhat entertained by all the antics.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Guest ListThe Hunting Party~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
75,Toxic Prey,"Lucas Davenport and his daughter, Letty, team up to track down a dangerous scientist whose latest project could endanger the entire world, in this latest thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author John Sandford.",4.56,"['April', '9,', '2024']","It’s been a while since population explosion and control has been at the heart of any thriller I’ve read. But in this, the 34th Lucas Davenport book, a scientist has decided the only way to save the planet is to significantly reduce the number of people living on it. Lionel Scott has spent his career studying infectious diseases, how they spread and the ability to make them more infectious. Now, he’s gone missing. In truth, the book is a Letty and Lucas story and Letty is at the forefront in the action. Lucas and Rae are brought in because of their ability to hunt down people. The book moves along at a brisk clip as the team tries to outthink the villains. For me, it’s important that thrillers stay on this side of the believability line. This one does that, especially given our recent experience with Covid. It works well to have a high level of tension, but with the inevitable downtime. Sandford realizes that even action heroes need to eat and sleep. The action is all within the realm of the possible. Sandford’s writing style is such that it’s easy to envision every scene. I also liked that Sandford has toned Letty down so she’s not some super girl character she displayed in her earlier books. Unlike some of Sandford’s other books, there’s not a lot of humor here. And while this is part of a long standing series, it can be read as a stand-alone. My thanks to Netgalley and Putnam Group for an advance copy of this book.",4.0

There’s only one problem—she’s not married”.But before she can figure out how she could possibly be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and a different man emerges in his place. And, like a parallel universe, a slightly altered life re-forms around her as well-Same flat, though furnished differently, same friends, though at different stages in their lives, DIFFERENT HUSBAND.If you don’t like the one who climbs down the ladder-send him back to the attic for something and see if you prefer who climbs down the ladder next!😂This unique premise sounded like so much fun BUT I didn’t really care for the execution. By the 50% point Lauren had met and rejected 160 husbands!!!No need to start a flow chart-we DON’T meet them all so we don’t get to know them any better than she did.At the halfway point, a husband emerges who really “gets” her. Will she decide to settle down, or will her quest to find “perfection” continue? I was hoping that this would be a turning point in the book.For me, this would have been better with LESS husbands and MORE of an opportunity to really get to know a couple and root for a favorite !! But, honestly, I didn’t warm up to Lauren and can’t say that I was rooting for her either!As written, I wasn’t quite as satisfied with this story as I had hoped to be, despite the fresh premise and the adorable book cover!A buddy read with DeAnn.

77,The Family Upstairs,,3.97,"['August', '6,', '2019']","3.25 confused, restless, is it fair enough to give lower points because you’re die-hard fan of Lisa Jewell fan question flying over my head, creepy, oh those guests should urgently get the hell out of the house stars!  Personally, honestly, I love this author’s work starting from “Watching you”, “Then she was gone”, “I found you”. She is the master evil queen of thrillers taken place in creepy houses and the characters formed in dysfunctional families who have unresolved issues.  So this book is one of them. I enjoyed the prologue. I felt all the goose-bumps on my arm, sweat dripping down my forearm, shivered uncontrollably. My intellectual appetite increased and my level of curiosity hit to the top.  Plot was intriguing: Unwanted and never-leaving guests occupied house and their numbers increased every day till they completely turned into an ominous, cursed and chilling cult, whose members wear ugly shapeless black clothes, chose organic style diet by famishing children. And we met David and Birdie, they’re one of the creepiest couples as like Natural Born Killer’s “Mickey and Mallory”, or any adopted children of Woody Allen and him.  Those parts of the book about Henry, who is probably younger version of Dexter, undiscovered sociopath who hides his unconditional love for Phin, captured my attention. His mother who is about to lose the rest of her marbles, his passive and obedient, weak father and his sister who is suffering from puberty crisis and uncontrollable occupation of CREEPY GUESTS who became THE REAL OWNERS of the house were remarkable and well-rounded characters. The thing I didn’t like and found confusing is way of 3 POV-ed story telling. I got the writer’s motive to put a bridge between past and future and connect three main characters’ stories, mash them in harmony. But the parts are too detailed and you started to feel like you’re drifting apart the main story, the creepy, disturbing guest part and dive into too many details about the other characters’ lives. There are so much enough materials on this book to write two other ones.  Till we reach the encounter of characters and combination part of their stories we may already solve their mystery. Being two steps ahead of the writer doesn’t make me happy!  So I wished we only read about the house’s past, rising of cult, Henry’s searching about paganism and his slow but expected move to the dark side. We already have David and Birdie to be shaken to the core.  The ending of the book was nice touch made me give extra 0.25 stars but I still expected more from this writer and as soon as I saw this book on my dashboard and screamed ( not for seeing my morning self in the mirror, for finding out NetGalley provided me the book, it was one of the happy and joyous screams) and the beginning excited me but the pacing got slower in the middle. It was still good written, detailed, riveting book. Lisa Jewell is one of the best story tellers I’ve ever seen and as a hopeless fan, I will keep happy screaming before starting her upcoming books. But this time, this book didn’t work so much for me!Special thanks to Atria Books and Netgalley to send me this ARC COPY and lighten up my day in exchange my honest review.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",3.0
78,Apples Never Fall,#1 New York Times Bestseller,3.77,"['September', '14,', '2021']","I've got to hand it to Liane Moriarty. Just when I think I've seen it all, she comes along and completely surprises me with this sparkling and startling gem of a tale.Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, has disappeared. Her adult children are rightfully aghast, but they're reluctant to report her missing. Because they know the prime suspect will be their father, and they're not really sure of his innocence. When the police start asking questions, it quickly becomes clear everyone in the family has stories to tell and secrets to hide. And before it's all over, everything will be revealed and laid bare.I've really been enjoying stories about dysfunctional families lately, and this is such a superb one. The four siblings are all trying to figure out if their father could've really murdered their mother, and if so, which side would they be on? It's a fascinating premise, and the progression of the story captures all of the nuanced facets that this dilemma would bring to the family.What I've always admired about Moriarty's writing is her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. She has this ability to peel back the layers of family relationships and what it means to be human, and to expose everything ugly and beautiful within, while injecting just that right dose of humor. This book hits upon tender subjects that everyone would recognize as familiar, yet instead of making me cry, it made me laugh.Needless to say, I found this whole thing to be utterly riveting and unputdownable. The characters are memorable, the strife feels all too real, and the dialogue is snappy. I devoured it in just a few days. While the mystery isn't the core of this book, there were still plenty of revelations along the way that kept me surprised and delighted.Liane Moriarty is back! This seemingly simple tale of dysfunctional families and relationships, of people's flaws and the messiness of their lives, of unmet expectations and unspoken dreams, hit all the right notes for me. It feels like Moriarty's last two books have been a little bit off of her true form. But with this one, she again returns to the pinnacle of her craft.My heartfelt thanks for the advance copy that was provided for my honest and unbiased review.",5.0

81,The Maidens,,3.63,"['June', '3,', '2021']","oooh, goodreads choice awards finalist for best mystery & thriller 2021! WHAT WILL HAPPEN LET’S FIND OUT!i have put off writing this review since reading the ARC back in MARCH because i didn't want to poop on anyone else's pre-release anticipation with my less-than-glowing reaction, but now that it's been out for a bit, i'm gonna let my poop out, too. stand back.i didn't get around to reading The Silent Patient until The Great Lockdown of 2020, and it was just the twistyfun distraction i needed from the world, so when i heard that his follow-up was going to be a campus thriller involving seeeeecret societies, classical mythology, and a sinister professor, my The Secret History-loving self was SO EXCITED, and the marketing campaign leading up to its release kindled alla my dark delicious anticipation. and yet.it's just...look, i hate being that guy, but it's just not very good. i'm pretty reasonable about managing my expectations when it comes to summertime psych-suspense thrillery books; they don't gotta be art, they just need to hold my interest and maybe throw a surprise or two my way. escapist entertainment is fine, but i don't like being insulted, and that's what this felt like.QUICKPLOT: mariana is a psychotherapist specializing in group therapy who is still hard-grieving the drowning-death of her beloved husband the previous year. she reluctantly returns to the memory-saturated college campus where their love story began to console her niece/adopted daughter-figure zoe after her best friend tara is found murdered. zoe suspects one of the professors of killing tara, and, encouraged by her former mentor, mariana decides to stick around and do some amateur sleuthing, during which time more girls are murdered. meanwhile, mariana is being low-key stalked by one of her patients from back home, and she meets a younger man who claims to be psychic and is convinced they have a romantic future together, because visions. my first gripe was with the structure. each chapter is about three pages long, which speeds up the pace and prevents the reader from becoming fully immersed in the story—we're just skimmed along through the plot points at a pace seemingly designed to camouflage the fact that there's no development happening; that this is more like an outline of a mystery novel than one fully-realized.the immersion problem is made worse by the frequent insertions of psych-stuff; these clinical asides breaking up the flow:Accompanying the housekeeper on shopping trips to the crowded and frenetic market in the center of Athens always made Mariana nervous. And she was relieved, and a little surprised, to return home unscathed. Large groups continued to intimidate her as she grew older. At school, she found herself on the sidelines, feeling as if she din't fit in with her classmates. And this feeling of not fitting in was hard to shake. Years later, in therapy, she came to understand that the schoolyard was simply a macrocosm of the family unit: meaning her uneasiness was less about the here and now—less about the schoolyard itself, or the market in Athens, or any other group in which she might find herself—and more to do with the family in which she grew up, and the lonely house she grew up in.on the very next page:Mariana grew up with a keen awareness of [her mother's] loss. As a therapist, she knew a baby's first sense of self comes through its parents' gaze. We are born being watched—our parents' expressions, what we see reflected in the mirror of their eyes, determines how we see ourselves. Mariana had lost her mother's gaze—and her father, well, he found it hard to look at her directly.i have a problem with that inserted ""well,"" voice-wise, but the bigger problem is the decision to develop a character thru psych 101 notes. it's...inelegant. i understand that she's a therapist and what she does is bound to inform who she is (which again opens up that whole can of worms re: voice), but these details just don't work in chapters this short; they're not well-integrated into the story, they distance the reader from the character and there's no opportunity to settle back in before we're off to the next chapter. in fact, a lot of this book feels like the author is shoehorning in details from his own personal cache of 'stuff he knows about,' without regard for their narrative utility: psychotherapy, the beauty of the greek islands, greek mythology, the greek language. these recurring motifs take up a lot of real estate at the expense of other story elements, like character development, and they don't do much to enhance the larger story. because here's what's not in his personal cache of 'stuff he knows about:' creating believable characters.NONE of the characters are believable, every interaction is fraught, written as though accompanied by a very intense and cheesy b-movie musical score, everyone all sticky with malice and foreboding. suspend all disbelief, ye who enter here. so. zoe believes professor edward fosca killed tara, claiming that they were having an affair and that, when tara threatened to expose their relationship, fosca threatened her right back and hours later, she turned up dead.edward fosca is a byronically handsome american professor specializing in greek tragedies (natch) who seems to only teach the prettiest girls on campus; several confident, intelligent girls known as the maidens who have formed a tight-knit little secret society based on the persephone myth, and whose education is frequently conducted by fosca in private sessions featuring drugs and alcohol and wild parties but it's not a harem at all, oh no, he's just the light these 20-year-old girlmoths collectively named after virginal ingenues gravitate towards and it's all perfectly normal academia. tara was one of the maidens, but neither fosca nor any of the other young women except zoe seem especially broken up over her death. to contrast grief-responses: mariana is clutching and weeping over her dead spouse's sneakers fourteen months after his death, but an inner-circle maiden dies and the next day these ladies are just fine and dandy, cool and snarky. now, you may well ask yourself why no one would give a little wait, what? about a female-student-collecting prof drinking behind closed doors with all these pretty little maidens, or find the optics of professor mcdreamy striding across campus trailed by an entourage of girls in flowy white dresses on their way to a memorial service...ill-advised? no objections at all, because on this campus, *shrug*, that's just how students learn. when mariana was matriculating, she developed a relationship with her (female) advisor that continues to the present-day, but began with the same kind of boundary-blurring: Most of the teaching...was done on a one-to-one basis, between fellow and student, usually taking place in the fellow's rooms. At any time after midday, or even earlier, at the discretion of the fellow concerned, alcohol was invariably served...providing an education in drinking as well as literature.It also meant that tutorials took on a more personal flavor, and lines between teacher and pupil became blurred—confidences were given, and intimacies exchanged.speaking of exchanged intimacies, fosca is eventually fired because he was, in fact, sleeping with ALL of the maidens. WHAT A COMPLETE SHOCK, SAID NO ONE. maybe shoulda looked into that before the bodies started dropping.mariana may understand that sometimes teachers and students drink together in private rooms and that's a totally normal part of the education process, but she trusts zoe's instincts about fosca's guilt, and he's certainly not acting unshady. cue dialogue:""I can see you have cast me as the villain—a predator preying on my vulnerable students. Except now you're met these young ladies, you can see there's nothing vulnerable about them. Nothing untoward happens at these meetings—it's just a small study group, discussing poetry, enjoying wine and intellectual debate.""""Except now one of those girls is dead.""Professor Fosca frowned. There was an unmistakable flash of anger in his eyes. He stared at her. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?""Mariana looked away, embarrassed by the question. ""No, of course not. I didn't mean—""""Forget it."" He took another drag of his cigarette, all anger apparently gone. ""The word 'psychotherapist,' as you know, comes from the Greek 'psyche,', meaning 'soul,' and 'therapeia,' meaning 'healing.' Are you a healer of souls? Will you heal mine?""""No. Only you can do that.""Fosca dropped his cigarette onto the path. He ground it into the earth with his foot. ""You're determined to dislike me. I don't know why.""i am determined to dislike them both because of how poorly they are written. that dialogue—yeesh. it's contrived and melodramatic and just bad. ""Do you think you can see inside my soul?"" really, michaelides? and then the old tonal switcheroo from melodrama to etymological mansplaining her profession to her? you can practically see the red-pen arrow promising ""authentic dialogue TK.""mariana is why we can't have nice things in the 'strong female character' department. i get that she's raw and marinating in grief, borderline hysterical with nostalgia and (figurative) ghosts, but she's impossible to root for. she does not come across as the intelligent, educated woman we are assured she is. while she's able to spew chonks of textbook psych-evaluations about those around her, they come across as reflexive; knee-jerk assessments without any real insight into human behavior. she's in a perma-fog, she responds emotionally in every situation, she misreads every room. she's a poorly drawn caricature: the grieving widow/meddling sleuth that all the men fall for even though it wasn't until sebaaaaastian that she ever felt beautiful blah blah blah. anyway, the guy she thinks is a murderer invites her to dinner at his place and she accepts:Fosca smiled. ""Good...My rooms, at eight? And one more thing—""Before she could stop him, he leaned forward—And he kissed her on the lips.It only lasted a second. By the time Mariana could react, he had already pulled back.Fosca turned and went through the open gate. Mariana heard him whistling as he walked away.She brushed away the kiss with her fist.How dare he?She felt as if she had been assaulted—attacked; and that he had won somehow, succeeded in wrong-footing, intimidating her.what on earth was that? that And one more thing— like he's a predatory columbo.  it's a power move out of a gothic melodrama, complete with the wilting female victim, and whistling? really? that whole scene is so...silly. okay, that covers structure and characters, so i guess plot is next? mariana's involvement in this investigation beggars belief. she is asked by her former advisor to assist in the investigation because 1) she is a group therapist, and the school is like a group, and 2) she used to go to the school. neither of these are qualifications for murder-solving, an elderly professor has no authority to deputize her onto the case, and mariana has a conflict of interest cluttering up her tunnel-vision, but no matter—she agrees and begins conducting her own interviews with various parties, slipping into the deceased's room and pawing through her stuff, hiding in shadows and spying on students and tagging zoe in on her amateur sleuthery, against the protestations of the actual police, whose case she is most definitely compromising. in fact, on page 73 the chief inspector attached to the case tells her to keep out of the investigation, which warning comes before she's even begun her actual snooping. mariana's dubious contributions to the investigation are superfluous—the authorities have already called in a renowned forensic psychologist to consult—a man with whom mariana is acquainted, who light-flirts with her and allows her to sit in on his suspect interviews. because all of this is how things work. i suppose we're meant to see this ignoring-police-mandates stance as plucky? determined? but she stumbles over clues and evidence on her merrily misguided crusade without looping in the people who actually know what they're doing until you just wanna shake her. where i lost my mind was when mariana is led to the location of the murder weapon by a non-police person, and it doesn't even occur to her to object when they remove it from its hidey-hole. i know she's not a professional with a responsibility to preserve evidence, but oh we just allow people to grab murder weapons now, do we? mariana? COME ON, MARIANA!but the real issue i had was with the reveal of whodunnit and why. the motive is dumb, the whole unfurled scope of the murder plot even dumber; an overcomplicated rube goldberg machine built on interlocking assumptions, wishful predictions, and magical thinking from a wholly unqualified strategist. there are at least five things about it that MAKE NO SENSE and the whole thing left me spluttering with outrage. seriously, ____ (proper noun) killed ___(pronoun) ______ (all-caps noun, two words) even though the whole reason for the murder was moot? you don't countermand that plan and find a different way? and ____ (proper noun) didn't recognize ANYTHING from ____'s (proper noun) life in that ___ (noun)? presumably, before ____ (proper noun) went all ______ (disparaging slang), they'd ______ (verb, past tense) about their _____ (noun, plural)?? no?and ____ (proper noun) waited _____ (period of time) before deciding to get ____(adjective)? and ____(verb, past tense) _______ (proper noun) for (noun)? even though _____ (series of facts we are told at the beginning that contradict motive and some math that may or may not be accurate?????????????)and don't get me started on the psychic love-interest. ""I have a gift for that sort of thing, you know—runs in my family—foresight, premonitions. I see things others do not.""so, he's psychic enough to see the future when it involves cartoon bubble-hearts, but he doesn't see ____ (proper noun) ___ (gerund) on the ____ (noun) as he ____ (verb, present tense) by, either IRL or in a vision? a psychic character is silly enough, a psychic character with so many blind-spots is narratively purposeless. and THEN—there's a nice little The Silent Patient connection, but he ruins the moment by bashing the reader over the head with it a couple more times to make sure we noticed, lessening the effect of the shared world, and it left me with the same bad-taste reaction as the similarly-shaped ending of Split, which tie-in-reveal is the only cool thing in an otherwise terrible film. the idea of a group therapist investigating a man who has nurtured a little cultlike group around him is rich with possibility, and the juxtaposition between fosca's ladygroup with henry in mariana's therapy group was so promising: As soon as any group establishes itself, it always arouses envy and attack—and not just from forces on the outside, those excluded from the group, but also from dark and dangerous forces within the group itself. but the execution is so weak—subplots fizzle out, lackluster red herrings (henry-ings?) are dropped unexplored in order to deliver the most ridiculous explanation of all time with no regard for the tradition of fair play in mystery novels. i could do this all day—i haven't even touched upon the postcards, or the on-the-nose focus on revenge tragedies, but i've already gone on so long here that i'm running out of review-space, despite cutting out so many tirade-tangents i don't even know if what's left of the review makes sense anymore, and i've spent so much time rereading chunks of the book to make sure i'm not missing anything that makes the book make sense, and i'm just getting hot and cranky and i want this to be over. this book is getting a lot of positive reviews, and i'm happy for those readers who enjoyed it, but i can't help wondering if maybe the ARC-version i read went through extensive revisions before its final draft because what i read doesn't feel like the product of a three-years-writing-and-revising follow-up to a runaway-success debut novel. The Secret History? more like weak-ret history. *********************************got a postcard in the mail yesterday...directing me to a website with this message: and i cannot wait. three cheers for intriguing marketing strategies!!!come to my blog!",2.0
82,And Then There Were None,,4.28,"['November', '6,', '1939']","There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting.**In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last.
“Be sure thy sin will find thee out.”
Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid. This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? 
“Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.”
If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None, it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies.Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.",4.0
83,Murder on the Orient Express,,4.20,"['January', '1,', '1934']","I’m pretty astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but “early-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime” doesn’t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it’s completely cool ok???Let’s discuss the very limited number of things I won’t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you’re a detective too, and if that’s not the dream I don’t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don’t, I’d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn’t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I’m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie’s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That’s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people’s individual psychology. That would’ve upset me, probably, if it weren’t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written! I could’ve replaced this whole review with those adjectives and been much more convincing.---------------pre-reviewTHAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING!(I hope you read that in Aziz Ansari's voice.

84,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,,4.17,"['August', '1,', '2005']","I've heard and read many complaints about Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo:1. It's misogynistic. 2. It's packed with cliché.3. It's too convoluted. 4. It's too disturbing.5. Lisbeth wasn't autistic enough or was foolishly autistic.6. There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0
85,Gone Girl,,4.13,"['December', '6,', '2012']","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0
86,The Girl on the Train,,3.96,"['January', '13,', '2015']","I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street. I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0
87,The Da Vinci Code,,3.92,"['March', '18,', '2003']","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
88,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,,4.33,"['May', '2,', '2019']","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0

90,The Silent Patient,The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.,4.18,"['January', '1,', '2018']","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0
91,One of Us Is Lying,the brain,3.94,"['May', '30,', '2017']","What a marvelous, delectable read! There was something so addictive about this book; it felt at times distinctly young adult while also having moments that felt so well done it was beyond the stereotype of what a teenage thriller tends to be. It’s taken me 4 days just to collect my thoughts to the point that I can attempt writing a proper review, and I’m certain this will be one of the most talked about books in the YA genre this Spring/Summer season. My issues with this book were minor, and I’ll get to those later, but when I first picked up this book I knew I would enjoy it based on the description stating “Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars”, two things I love to pieces. While this was in some ways a traditional whodunnit, I believe many of the minor influences were the reason this novel reads so well.According the the books I’ve logged on Goodreads, I’ve managed to read over 700 mystery, thriller, and suspense novels. That is an overwhelming number of books that tend to be fiercely judged on their ability to provide a solid, mind-blowing twist. The reason I mention this is due to the fact that it is very difficult for me to pick up a mystery and not have it solved in the first 10% if the clues are provided; otherwise, I typically pick it up when said character is first introduced into the narrative. One of Us Is Lying is bound to be one of many fabulous novels that gets thrown into that category and is scrutinized solely by it’s ability to keep the reader guessing “whodunnit” until the big reveal. Again, I mention this because I think it would be a grave mistake for the reader to be so focused on this aspect when the book has so much more to offer! Personally, I had it figured out in the first chapter. As stated in the summary, the pieces are there for the reader to put together if they are clever enough. I applaud the author for her cleverness and storytelling abilities; there will be many readers who will be fooled by the red herrings and receive that glorious 
AHA
 moment at the big reveal. Why am I rambling on about this you ask? I really want to drive home the point of what makes this book stand out from others that are similar.The Characters. It is a rare day indeed that I find fleshed out, grounded, relatable characters that draw me in to a young adult narrative the way that these did here. My 
AHA
 moment may not have come during the big twist, but it certainly came in waves abounding throughout my experience journeying with these various high school kids. I was sure this would be another read with those stereotypical teenagers that give contemporary YA novels a bad rep; for crying out loud the stereotypes are printed on the inside of the book cover in the description! I think this was a clever move by the publisher and author; if other readers pull the same underestimation as I did, they will be more than pleasantly surprised at what they get out of this book. In referral to the wrapping up of characters and not the twist, the ending was one of the best I’ve seen in awhile. There is no gag worthy happily ever after where everyone is perfectly paired up in couples and they ride off into the sunset on their baby unicorns while the sun beats down on their pimple free faces…. No, while there are some upbeats moments, the ending is messy and real and I welcomed it whole heartedly. People made mistakes beyond the central narrative and there were consequences and some things were left open-ended in the way that makes you wonder what their eventual decisions lead to. I’m extremely pleased that the author chose to take some risky leeway with her writing direction and applaud her with a standing ovation.Alright, I said I would get to the minor issues and I kind of lied. Please don’t hate me, but there was a tiny aspect of this book that I thought I could get past, and even though I can’t discuss it outright (because these spoilers involve blowing the entire plot of the book), my conscience just wouldn’t let me finish this review without mentioning them in the broadest of terms. Again, I applaud the author for tackling some really tough issues and concerns in this book, and I don’t think she wrote anything wrong on her end. I think it’s more of an issue I’ve seen present itself across a wide number of YA books recently. Some who may be dealing with mental illness may perceive the outcome of this novel in an unrealistic way and I can see the possibility of various readers being split on their opinions of some of the content presented. I will say, I feel it was handled better in this book than in others I have read previously. As always, if you’ve read this book early or once you have a chance to read it and would like to discuss, please feel free to private message me and I’ll gladly have a respectful chat with you.This is a review I’ve been struggling to write for a few days now and I hope I’ve done it justice. There just aren’t words to describe how completely readable this book really is. McManus did such a fabulous job of making me just as interested in the individual secrets and side stories of the “Murder Club” as I was in the central mystery surrounding Simon’s death. The author had me convinced that this couldn’t possibly be her debut novel, and if this is what she has published first, I can only imagine the treats we will receive in written form from her down the road. I’m a committed fan now and I can’t wait to see what she publishes next. Highly recommended to teens, sure, but I think loads of adults are going to enjoy this one as well. There’s something really special and unique to this story that defies the boundaries of age gaps and will have me remembering it for months to come.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy; it was a pleasure to post my honest thoughts here.",4.0
92,The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle,,3.82,"['February', '8,', '2018']","CLICK HERE for a Booktube Video about:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go - doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!
The Written Review
 Read this one for TCE book club! 
 If this isn’t hell, the devil is surely taking notes.
Lord and Lady Hardcastle are throwing a ""party"" at Blackheath, their crumbling British mansion.This so-called-party takes place on the anniversary of their son's murder (19 years ago), includes the exact same guests as it did so many years ago.And, during the night, trusts will be violated, truths will be exposed and above all, their daughter, Evelyn Hardcastle will be murdered.Aidan Bishop, along with two others,  are in competition to be the first to discover Evelyn Hardcastle's murderer.
Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded.
Bishop relives the night of Evelyn's murder for eight days, and each day he is in a different body and has a new chance to find the murderer. 
Life doesn’t always leave you a choice in how you live it.
The first day, Bishop wakes up in Dr. Sebastian Bell's body, without a clue as to where he is and what he is supposed to do.The second day, Bishop wakes up in the butler's body...but ""past-Bishop"" is also inhabiting Bell's body. Which leads to a lot of confusion and surprise.The third day, there's current-Bishop, past-Bishop and past-past-Bishop....well you get the point. Each day Bishop adds another ""character"" under his belt. He gets eight bodies, and eight days, to piece together the mystery. The two others who are in competition with Bishop are unknown to him and are also inhabiting bodies (though, unlike him, they cannot swap and every ""day"" their memories reset). They are all racing to find out the murderer, because whoever can figure out this mystery is the winner.And the winner? 
The winner gets to escape.

How lost do you have to be to let the devil lead you home?
This book was confusing in the best way possible.I could barely write my summary - there's just so many layers of complexity and betrayals and everything.So effing impressed. I was wholly ensnared by the mystery - I hardly knew what to think or where to look - but it was such a fun and wild ride that I didn't care.Aiden Bishop was a wonderfully fleshed-out character and Turton did a particularly excellent job with the various bodies that Bishop possessed.In particular, I loved how each body Bishop possessed would begin to influence him. When he was Dr. Sebastian Bell, Bishop was meek, under the butler's influence Bishop became moralistic and so on. It was fascinating to watch how that played out.The only thing that threw me slightly was the end. The build to the climax and the ending were superb...but the actual grand reveal was a bit of a letdown.I honestly don't know what I as expecting, just something a bit ""more"" - if that makes any sense...All I know is that this is an author to watch. 
I cannot wait to see what Turton writes next!!

We are never more ourselves than when we think people aren’t watching.

93,The Cuckoo's Calling,,3.89,"['April', '18,', '2013']","Feb 3rd 2014 - Extra things you should know: 1) This is a negative review. If you are looking for reviews that confirm what you are already certain of (that JKR can do no wrong) here are some examples of positive reviews for you - 1, 2, 3. 2) I used some Mary Poppins gifs to make my point in this review. It seemed funny at the time. If you find MP gifs stupid/annoying/beneath you, then please feel free to go to the reviews I linked before. 3) I will no longer reply to comments saying I am stupid or didn't get it. I will no longer reply to insults of any kind or condescending suggestions that I read the book again. If you're tempted to write something like this, save both of us some time and read the previous comments for my answers to people like you. I have way too many unwatched episodes of Law & Order to entertain trolls any longer.4) I'm sorry to all the people who have been kind and respectful, whether they agreed with me or not. You can just ignore these points.____________________________Things you should know: 1) Ms Rowling filled my childhood and early teen years with magic. I love Harry Potter and I confess to only adding this book after I found out she was the author. 2) I did not go into this with the intention to compare it to Harry Potter. I did not expect magic or wizards and I fully anticipated this being very different to the HP books. 3) I have read and enjoyed many mystery/crime novels in the past. My favourites being by Tana French and Gillian Flynn. So, there was no reason why I couldn't have enjoyed this book simply because it wasn't magical Potterland. But I didn't and, after putting a lot of thought into this, I think I finally understand why.Here's the sad truth: I can't stand Rowling's writing when she writes for adults. I actually find it painful to read. Let's be clear from the beginning, I started and never finished The Casual Vacancy because the opening didn't grab me and there was something about it - something which I couldn't put my finger on - that made it an effort to get through. A certain style to the writing which didn't agree with me. I thought perhaps it was a one-off because I'd read all her other works and never had a problem with her writing style. That's why I jumped at the chance to try another adult book by Rowling and sort out what was evidently a bout of silliness on my part. What this book did give me was an answer to why neither of Rowling's adult books worked for me.Rowling writes in an unusual manner. It's not unique to her work for adults, Harry Potter has it too, but the effect had on both is very different. Rowling's style of writing, including the dialogue between characters, is formal to the point of being old-fashioned. Part of me wants to compare it to Austen but I'm cautious of doing so because of the amount of people (usually including myself) who might read that as a compliment. Rowling's formal style doesn't work, for me, when using it in an adult mystery and pairing it with profanity and grisly murders. It feels out of place and weighs down each page with tedious descriptions that use too many awkward similes, metaphors and adjectives. ""...face the colour of corned beef...""""...the snow fell with soft fingertip plunks...""""...long-snouted cameras...""Her descriptions all felt a bit off to me. And I particularly didn't like the unsophisticated use of big words. It's like when inexperienced indie authors go crazy with thesaurus.com, using clunky words like ""exacerbated"" and ""exorbitant"" in casual sentences that don't benefit from it. The characters in this book never check the time or look at their watches, they ""consult"" their watches. Think I'm being picky? Try reading whole pages where every sentence replaces the obvious words with complex ones and see how far you get without your brain starting to scream. And it felt like every single noun had at least one adjective before it. Not only that, but Rowling repeats similar adjectives when referring to the objects again. In one sentence, we are told she climbed the ""steel stairs"" and in the next she's continuing up the ""metal stairs"". WHY???? And also WHYYYYYY???Another example of Rowling's old-fashioned style is her frequent use of expressions like ""oh my!"" and ""goodness!"", expressions I'm sure some of you will recognise from Harry Potter characters. What is this? It's like Mary Poppins or Little Women or, I don't know, Little House on the Prairie. And maybe it works fine in all of those, same as it works fine in Harry Potter, but none of those also had a side-helping of profanity and very adult themes. They do all, however, share the formal language style.And while I think people were silly to say things about The Casual Vacancy like ""ohmigod this had, like, noooooo magic and even fewer dark lords"" when Rowling clearly said it was an adult mystery book and I wanted to say to those silly people:I still think it's entirely relevant to compare the two when looking at Rowling's writing style and the reason why sometimes it works and sometimes it really doesn't. The formal tone with simplistic language - like in Harry Potter - is okay, but dense descriptions and over-complicated sentences made it hard work and tedious in this book. It's like a very formal letter with the occasional random swear word thrown in. And it doesn't work. Not for me, anyway. The style simply doesn't fit the content; there's swearing and murders and people rescuing others by grabbing their breasts...I'm not even going to talk about the story beyond saying I found it a standard mystery that could have been good if I'd not had these other reasons for not liking it. The killer is not hard to guess for anyone familiar with crime mysteries but that isn't usually what I care about most in crime mysteries anyway. Plus, in this case, I'm just too blinded by my dislike for the writing. *sigh* I think it's fair to say that I'm finally done trying to enjoy Rowling's adult books.P.S. Yes, I did get a little overexcited when I googled Mary Poppins gifs.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",1.0
94,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,,4.27,"['June', '7,', '1926']","I went into this book with a bit of an attitude. Roger Ackroyd is the only Agatha Christie book featured on the list of 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, and I was skeptical about the List's claim that this was the only Christie book worth reading. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I think the List is right on this one. At least a little - I'm definitely not suggesting that you should read this book and then never pick up a Christie novel ever again, but if you find yourself in a situation where you're going to spend a month on a desert island and can only bring one book, and the only books you've been offered are from the Agatha Christie canon, you should pick this one. The ending (which I will not discuss in explicit detail for fear of spoilers) is what makes this a 5-star book. Let me assure you: you will not guess who the murderer is. Never ever ever. When the murderer is revealed, you will not believe. When the murderer goes on to explain his/her actions, you will continue to not believe it. Only by rereading certain important passages will you start to realize that the answer was in front of you all the time, and you couldn't see it. It's a testament to Christie's skill as a writer that this is accomplished. And, having now read a Miss Marple mystery, I'm going to choose a side: I'm officially Team Hercule. He is silly and self-centered and ridiculous and funny and all I want to do is pinch his cheeks and then go sit in a cafe with him and eat croissants. My favorite part of the book is when Poirot makes his grand entrance. The narrator, Dr. Sheppard, is in his garden when someone throws a vegetable marrow over the wall. A second later, the doctor's new neighbor pokes his ""egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes"" over the garden wall and attempts to explain himself:""I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense. For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I enrage myself with the marrows. I send them to promenade themselves - alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.""",5.0

THERAPY FOR ALL OF YOU! my thoughts (mild spoilers ahead)• i ain't never seen four emotionally intelligent brothers. two of them always gotta have unaddressed trauma.• the young adult threshold for personality is in HELL. all you need to do is give your teenage main character a vaguely tragic past, enough stubbornness to allow her to mildly bump heads with love interests every once in a while, a weakness for hot emotionally unavailable rich boys, and a best friend of color to carry things (for flavor).• not this billionaire secretly surveilling a low income teenage girl for most of her adolescence while she's struggling to stay afloat and literally living out of her car? taking and saving photos of her without her knowledge? and hoarding his wealth all the while? while she's barely scraping by? until the day he dies and finally decides—now that he no longer needs that wealth—it'll all go to her in exchange for using her as a pawn in his family's trauma olympics? GUILLOTINE!• LIKE? ARE YOU DERANGED? JUST HIRE A FAMILY THERAPIST? YOU LITERALLY HAVE EVERY RESOURCE AT YOUR DISPOSAL?• i clocked the endgame from the moment the hawthorne brothers were introduced, which is always irritating, because love triangles only really work (at least for me) when there seems to be a genuine struggle to decide between two equally interesting, three dimensional characters. • not to get into semantics, but if faced with a choice between two rich white boys, why NOT PICK THE ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIST?

100,"The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church",The first definitive book that names the massive social movement of people leaving the white evangelical church—the exvangelicals,4.24,"['March', '19,', '2024']","As a member of what I consider the Christian Left, I often wonder if I’m reading the same Bible as the Evangelicals that follow Trump. Where is the compassion for our fellow man? Where is the concern, not just for an embryo, but also the child? So, I was interested to see what Sarah McCammon had to say about the supposed growing number of younger people leaving the movement. I think one of the important things she says is that it’s not just a religious sect, it’s a community and a culture and leaving it often leads to the loss of family and friends. McCammon walks the reader through the mindset of the Evangelical culture, especially the belief that the Bible is infallible, scientists are not to be trusted and only they know the “truth”. She spends a lot of time on their refusal to believe in evolution. It actually gave me a better understanding of how so many can fall for Trump’s claptrap. When your belief system doesn’t allow for any wavering or skepticism, for any allowance for change, it makes it more plausible that you’ll only accept the “facts” that suit your narrative, regardless of their accuracy. “Information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe’s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. ‘Good for our side’ and ‘true’ begin to blur into one.”The one problem I had with the book is that she never really makes her case for “the massive social movement” of people leaving the evangelical church. She cites individuals and their reasons - LGBTQ+ issues, women’s roles, sexual freedom and corporal punishment. But I never got a sense of how many people she was talking about. Likewise, while I found the section on religious trauma enlightening, I was curious to know how widespread it was. Maybe there’s no way to know. But I would have been interested to know if there were any studies. This is probably a book that will “preach to the choir”. I can’t envision many still firmly invested in the evangelical movement reading it. But maybe it will provide a sense of community to those who have left but feel they’re alone in their situation. I was impressed by the number of folks she mentions that have social media presences. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.Update - this book is really sticking with me. I find myself recommending it right and left.",4.0
101,Cloistered: My Years as a Nun,,3.83,"['March', '7,', '2024']","I love reading about the secret culture of nuns, and since this was an actual memoir I was even further intrigued. A young woman in her twenties found refuge in the Catholic Church after the death of her father. She joined the Carmelite order, embracing the silence. Her ""cell"" which was her assigned bedroom in Akenside Priory was a safe haven, with its large, spare black cross, its white walls, rolling hills of greenery out the window, and most of all- its solitary quiet. However, during her twelve years within its confines, Catherine experienced cliques, politics, unfairness, and power plays. I felt a bit detached reading the many passages that went into the weeds about the deep religious concepts. It was all ""over my head"" and I didn't feel like delving into those tenets. There was also a lot of talk about nature because of the locale of the monastery and the necessity of the nuns working the property, tending the gardens. I'm not a fan of extensive conversation and description about nature either. I did feel a kinship with Catherine feeling the peace and quiet of her room, as she gazed out her window at the gentle, rolling fields. I enjoyed learning about the intake process and inner workings of living the Carmelite order, including the schedules for each day. The person who was the most gifted at cooking quite possibly would not be the one assigned to cook. I loved hearing about the bread baking, mixing up dried milk (because it was cheaper), having a ""Little Jug"" (a quick, small breakfast eaten standing up before chores), and the half hour set aside for conversation each day. It was very disturbing hearing about some of the diabolical maneuverings.This book clocked in at just over 350 pages, which felt pretty long. If some of the religious philosophical meanderings and nature talk could have been excised out, I would have enjoyed this memoir even more, as it was a pretty interesting story.Thank you to the publisher St. Martin's Press who provided an advance reader copy via NetGalley.",3.0
102,A Very Private School: A Memoir,"In this poignant memoir, Charles Spencer recounts the trauma of being sent away from home at age eight to attend boarding school.",4.26,"['March', '12,', '2024']","I've long been fascinated by the nature of evil. It seems that evil can be tackled only when humans understand its deceptiveness. One truism is that evil is often to be found hidden beneath convincing veneers of caring authority. It's one of the best covers that exists. And what is more evil than destroying and crushing a vulnerable child? Charles Spencer (otherwise known as Earl Spencer) offers a searing, uncompromising account of some highly formative years spent at a boarding prep school, Maidwell Hall, in England in the 1970s. The traditional tendency of the upper classes in England to send their children to such boarding schools at ridiculously young ages is well known. Less well known is the fact that these students were often subjected to the same sadistic brutality that seemed to be accepted in many educational institutions up until at least the early 1980s (in Ireland also). Although I prefer reading paper books, as I find audiobooks fairly hit and miss, I suspected the quality of the narration would be high in this case, as it was the author reading. He has been known for strong, powerful delivery of uncomfortable truths since his eulogy at his sister Princess Diana's funeral many years ago, which somehow managed to be full of righteous anger and dignified at the same time. Similar could be said of this book.Spencer doesn't shy away from providing disturbing details of the sadism and perversions of some staff at Maidwell, as well as the horrendous life-long emotional impact it had on the students as they went on in life. I've always admired his commitment to staring reality in the face, but this takes things to a whole new level. It starts a conversation that is probably long overdue in England about children's emotional welfare and how boarding schools affect their relationships and ability to be intimate in later life. The details of this book are disturbing in the extreme, with Spencer himself going into a lot of depth about the assistant matron who predated on himself and other boys in her charge, causing them extreme confusion and essentially stealing an important part of their childhood. Details about the school's headmaster are highly unsettling, and it's clear he was a predator also, who was clever at disguising this fact to parents with jaunty school reports. Parents were regularly deceived into thinking he was a genial man with humorous insights about their children, and that he cared deeply about their welfare. Spencer, on the other hand, describes how men still had visible stripes from vicious canings well into mid-life, not to mention the psychological scars to accompany them.The book also describes the obligatory violent teacher who hates the boys because of his class hangups about their upper-class backgrounds. It's a stark reminder of the fact that child abuse is no respecter of social rank. Abusers will find their interal excuses one way or another to defend the indefensible.This is a depressing, sorry tale on one level. However, it also offers a huge spark of hope for the future of education and therefore humanity generally. It's not a book that can be ignored by the establishment, given who wrote it, and what it must have taken emotionally to put the words on paper so powerfully. The interviews with other Maidwell students from that time are equally poignant and often heartbreaking, with some men's lives irretrievably ruined due to their time in the school. This book is an impressive achievement on the part of Charles Spencer, a person who has had more than his fair share of upheaval and loss. He has gifted the world with difficult truths more than once, and everyone should thank him for this unflinching courage.",5.0
103,Waiting for the Monsoon,,4.25,"['March', '5,', '2024']","A foreign correspondent, diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, looks back at a remarkable life of overcoming adversity and reporting from war zones. Nordland has already outlived his surgeon's prognosis by more than three years, taking advantage of what he calls his ""Second Life"" to cultivate gratitude and healthy habits, and, of course, to write this. Growing up in poverty with a physically abusive father encouraged self-sufficiency. Much of the book is given over to stories from the field. Nordland thrived on excitement, and conveys the thrill and danger to readers. Part II, ""After the Monsoon,"" marks an inevitable change of pace as the author considers the setbacks of the past few years. Overall, I was more interested in his upbringing and cancer journey than in his wartime experience, but others will feel differently. By virtually anyone's standards, though, he has lived a fascinating life, full of hardship but consistently hopeful. (More of a 3.5, really.)See my full review at BookBrowse.

104,"Learning to Think: A Memoir of Faith, Superstition, and the Courage to Ask Questions",,4.11,"['March', '7,', '2024']","Briefly - A remarkable tale of an intensely personal lifeIn fullThis is an intensely personal memoir about Tracy's life mostly relating to when she was younger, mostly in her teens. It is remarkable for its openness and, under the circumstances its balance. There is a ""born again"" Christian part of this and aspects of her childhood and early on her teen years to a degree were quite happy. However under the surface things were not always that good. The book opens with her being exorcised of her demons by to men from her church. Her father had difficulties with work in part due to his alcoholism. Her mother had mental health issues and Tracy was often acting a support for her. Her older sister had issues with school attendance and was placed into care. Add in the fact that her father was murdered and I find it remarkable that Tracy can writes such an account of her life.The more I look back on reading this the less I like the idea of passing judging on this in terms of ratings. On platforms that allow no rating that is what I will do. In no way is this intended as a judgement on this book, simply the fact that I fail to see what right I have to ""review"" in that way the life that Tracy had. The contrasts in Tracy life are wide and varied. The fact that she managed to get through to where she is now speaks volumes for her as a person. However it also says a lot to me about the positives from her early life often provided by her parents.I really liked the fact that there is some humour here too. While Tracy found that conventional education didn't work for her (any more than it had for her sister) she didn't let little things like that stop her - I loved her description of the German exam she took having only done one class on the subject in the whole year. For me it said quite a lot about her and in a positive way.I found this very readable however the book changed for me around 75% through to something that went up a level. Having maybe got on top of the real issues in her life Tracy decides she wants to look further at her father's murder. I was frankly amazed at the way she dealt with this aspect - again it says a great deal about her as a person. Worth bearing in mind that Tracy says""…trauma like mine is not rare. What is rare is that someone like me has an opportunity to tell her story"". Sadly I think that is very true and for that alone this book is important.I'd like to return to the title of this book - Learning to Think. To me it's a very good title and maybe is key to Tracy's life and ability to recover in the broadest sense from the events in her early life. It fascinated me (and I was slightly envious) that her father used to give them ""logic"" problems to solve. I guess as an engineer of sorts this was something quite basic to him. I do feel that set a wonderful foundation for her ability to think. After that came people she met and engaged with (rarely school based). After that she started reading quite deep and profound books. I can't judge what worked for Tracy but these feel like significant factors on her life journey to me.This really is a unusual and remarkable read. There are plenty of parts of this book that I made notes on and might comment on however it is far better to discover her story for yourself. It won't be for everyone however I'm guessing that quite a few people will finds aspects of this resonate with them. It made me smile, it made me angry, it made me sad and sincerely I thanks Tracy for sharing her story.Note - I received an advance digital copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair review",

While Camarillo Gutierrez has a compelling life story to date, there needs to be more substance, self-reflection, and maturity to constitute a memoir. Reading her book, I felt it was another box checked by the author as she plans a political career. Much of the narrative chronologically accounts for the author's day-to-day activities - TMI. I kept waiting for some tension to develop, but the moment never arrived. I wasn't very excited about picking it up, and I was going to DNF it, but I decided to read the book as an anthropologic observation of a GenZ coming of age - then I enjoyed it more.This said I have a strong interest in Elizabeth's story. An undocumented young man joined my family in 9th grade when he had a family crisis not unlike Elizabeth's. So I get it. But what does the author want us to take away from her book? There are no policy recommendations, no recommendations on how we could help children like her, and no way forward.

106,Troubled,,4.40,"['February', '20,', '2024']","Troubled, the part memoir, part manifesto from Rob Henderson is a fascinatingly structured book, softening the reader up with two hundred pages about his undeniably harrowing childhood and adolescence, adding some reasonable analysis of the importance of children growing up in stable, loving family units, before hammering them with his half-baked hypothesis about class. Each chapter is written from the perspective of Henderson at a different ages, from very young childhood to late twenties, and the author makes it clear from the outset that he will leave the analysis and reflection to the later chapters because this is the point at which he had the distance, knowledge and understanding to reflect on what had happened to him and what his experiences represented for society more broadly. His story of being shuttled between overcrowded foster homes, and then of the series of misfortunes that befell him after being adopted, is both heartwrenching and compelling. Henderson's points about the importance of firm boundaries, high expectations and secure attachment are eminently sensible and backed by not only anecdotes from his own life and his friends' lives but by comprehensive research. The main theme which underpins Henderson’s recollections of his early life is family, and the importance of stability and security to children growing up. He rallies against schemes aimed at helping young people from disadvantaged communities get into college, for example, citing considerable research suggesting that educational opportunities cannot make up for a chaotic homelife. However, while he is very clear on what is not helping these children to be happy and fulfilled, he fails to posit any solutions to what he believes is the biggest problem afflicting poor Americans.Henderson makes interesting observations about 'trickle-down meritocracy' at top universities, whereby positive discrimination policies have been put in place to address the lack of diversity (racial and economic) in the hope that the advantages these chosen members of a community accrue will ultimately benefit their whole community. But then, seemingly without irony, he writes that, 'Representation certainly benefits a handful of people who are chosen to enter elite spaces, but it doesn't seem to improve the lives of the dispossessed. In fact, it might backfire. Elite institutions strip-mine talented people out of their communities. Upon completing their education, most of these graduates do not return to their old neighborhoods. Instead, they relocate to a handful of cities where they live alongside their highly educated peers, eroding the bonds of solidarity they had with those they left behind. And who could blame them? It is reasonable to use your talents to advance your career and financial prospects. But if the original intent was to help languishing communities, then this particular solution is failing.' It is unclear how he squares this belief with the hope that children will be inspired by his story, which can only be heard because he wae selected for these opportunities.  I had not read Henderson’s 2018 New York Times op-ed Luxury beliefs are the latest status symbol for rich Americans prior to beginning Troubled - possibly because, to paraphrase Henderson, I don't have 'the kind of job that allows you to browse Twitter' or affords you the time to 'stay current on the proper way to think about social issues.' Thus, I came into Henderson’s book under-prepared: I expected a memoir but wasn't ready for the proselytising. Henderson’s theory about luxury beliefs evolved from Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), his angle being that in the 21st century, rather than indulging in frivolous, economically unproductive hobbies such as golf or beagling, the upper class fritters their time away thinking about the irrelevance of religion, cultural appropriation, and the legalisation of drugs, amongst other ideas which ordinary people cannot spare a thought for because 'they have real problems to worry about.'According to Henderson, the only reason why anyone would hold these beliefs is to show off their class and education to their peers, just as one might flaunt a designer handbag or expensive car. Somehow, he is able to categorically know that no one has come to these conclusions through their own research, or that they truly understand the stances they are endorsing. Henderson glibly muses that, 'Maybe the luxury belief class is ignorant of the realities of who is most harmed by crime. Or perhaps they don't care that the poor will become even more victimized than they already are.' And yet, a cursory amount of reading would reveal that the American War on Drugs, to use an example of a policy counter to one of Henderson’s luxury beliefs, is responsible for swollen prison populations, single parent families and millions of families ruined by addiction. This is just one example of Henderson’s argument seeming under-researched and flawed. He just isn't that informed about some of the issues that are central to his hypothesis, he makes lazy presumptions about the net benefit of ideas he supports, and his ignorance only serves to patronise those whom he purports to speak for. Henderson’s theory is littered with contradictions; it is painfully ironic that the people who would have the time to read his op-ed, his newsletter and his book, and to ruminate on his ideas, are the very same  people he decries. At the time of writing, he has spent time in poor working class communities, in the United States Air Force, and at some of the world's top academic enclaves. How does he know what 'ordinary' people believe about these issues? The rigour of his research into the role of the family has been replaced by anecdotal evidence camouflaged by statistics, and, while I do not dispute that he observed a correlation between students from specific backgrounds subscribing to specific views, this does not prove causation. Indeed, if Henderson were to spend time in a town with similar deprivation markers to his adopted hometown of Red Bluff, but with a predominantly Black population, he would likely find support for the idea of police reform. Furthermore, in having the time to conjecture on his ideas whilst pursuing a PhD at Cambridge University, has Henderson himself not become one of the elites he so despises? Georges Prat, a Canadian criminal lawyer, writing for Medium in 2021, had this to say of Henderson’s hypothesis:If I were to guess, I’d say Henderson is simply a highly conservative person who arrived at university and hadn’t been in touch with left-wing woke politics prior to that. He had a strong sense of certainty in his own views, so when he encountered opposing views, he didn’t even bother entertaining them to evaluate their merits. Instead, he dismissed them as nonsense. After that, he had to find a way to reconcile the apparent intelligence of his peers with the “nonsense” views they held... One gets the sense he feels so certain in the correctness of his conservative views that he came up with a way to explain away the opposing views held by his university peers, i.e. “they only believe that because they’re affluent status seekers displaying their luxury beliefs as a way to move up the social hierarchy. Obviously the ideas themselves have no merit.'It is a shame that Henderson chose to conclude his book with his soap-boxing, as the rest of the book is moving and rousing. Thank you to NetGalley and Swift Press for the opportunity to read and review an ARC of this book.",3.0

Audiobook—Author ReadingWhen I was a psychology undergraduate at university in Australia in the early 1990s I was given access to the university VAX computers as part of our compulsory statistics course. This was still a time when typing up an essay, with errors corrected in tippex was seen as fancy, most students still handwrote course assignments, and most professors still hadn't learnt of email, and HTML was a few years away. What my professor didn't know was that having a VAX account came along with Internet access and when I realized this I went wild. Suddenly I had access to email and Usenet discussion groups. On a backgammon group I suggested we stop talking about games and actually play them, and so ended up running the first International BG tournament through my statistics account—non-trivial as email was the sole form of communication for players (how do you show a board? how do you roll dice in a way that players see as fair?). My professor commended me for being so hard working as my time online was audited.It's clear from her account that Swisher got the Internet as I did, and took the jump, leaving a golden path to politics reporter at the Washington Post to the (then) very niche job of tech reporter on the West Coast. She was there at the beginning and broke many key stories on Silicon Valley as it developed, and in the process becoming a Silicon Valley icon herself.So this book should have been a easy win for me. However, it turned out to be a vapid nothingburger. The book is made up of chapters where Swisher mostly bashes Internet founders as narcissistic white man children—something I can get behind—but her analysis is so shallow it basically exists at the level of name calling. The Google Founders are labelled the weird twins and criticised in a mild way for ripping off intellectual property. Mark Zuckerberg is apparently still a teenage arsehole that sweats a lot when he's nervous. Bezos is super ambitious and given a star for getting internet delivery sorted out—but is also an arsehole. Musk was apparently a great guy until he bought Twitter and ruined it for Swisher (what about all the shitty things he did before then with Tesla??). Steve Jobs was an arsehole, but a visionary and so he gets a pass. Nothing she says is interesting or deep or new here. The other chapters are a sort of Wikipedia style summary of her life. She got a job here, she dated so and so, married someone else, had a child, started this business or that business. None of it is anywhere deep or personal enough to be of much interest. Most of this seems to be either to puff-up her self worth or aid in her slagging off of this or that boss from decades past. She also has this annoying habit of constantly talking about how ""tough"" she is, how ""mean but fair"" she is. Isn't that what any decent journalist is? The only thing I'll take from the book is Sergey Brin's baby shower in 2008, where the rich and famous attendees were forced to choose between wearing nappies or onesies, and could drink expensive vodka dripping from an ice statue's nipple. Normally I don't give one-stars, as I usually abandon these sorts of books before the end, but since I finished this one I'll rate it.1-star.",1.0
109,This American Ex-Wife: How I Ended My Marriage and Started My Life,,4.17,"['February', '20,', '2024']","This had a lot of the same problems as Lenz's two previous books but now that we're on book #3 I'm frankly out of patience. This is similar to a lot of contemporary nonfiction these days in that it blends memoir with social commentary in an attempt to tie the author's own experience to a larger narrative but it fails badly due in part to the fact that Lenz isn't a strong enough writer to pull it all together and in part because she seems either unaware or unwilling to acknowledge her experience is not the typical 2020s heterosexual marriage. Lenz was the homeschooled daughter of evangelical conservatives and her marriage dynamics could have come straight from the 1950s (at one point she mentions packing her husband lunch's every day for years). As glad as I am Lenz is no longer living a life she clearly felt suffocated by, I was frustrated by how broad a brush she painted with. I wish she had followed a similar vein as other ex-evangelical women who have written heartbreaking and powerful memoirs in recent years detailing how badly the promises of Christian patriarchy fail women (Shannon Harris' 'The Woman They Wanted' is a recent example) because Lenz clearly has important things to say but her attempt to paint marriage as an overwhelming net negative with little room for nuance in chapter after chapter felt very one-note. None of her criticisms of heterosexual marriage feel particularly groundbreaking if you've had any prior engagement with feminist theory, and some of the data she uses to support her arguments feel cherrypicked. I was also very thrown by this line in a Time Magazine essay  Lenz wrote as part of her book promotion, which is not mentioned in the actual book: ""I knew money would be tight when I left. I didn’t have access to our joint account and had to set up a secret account to save money for a lawyer."" This is not just a description of an unhappy marriage, this is financial abuse. That word--abuse--is to my recollection never included in  This American Ex-Wife . Maybe it should have been.",2.0
110,"Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood",,4.11,"['February', '13,', '2024']","Why do we rush to read books from our favorite celebrities? Why do we immerse ourselves in the lives of our favorite actors, singers, writers, filmmakers, and others? While it seems like everyone right now is reading books from Britney Spears or Jada Pinkett-Smith or others, I barely raised an eyebrow when those titles were released and instead my heart went aflutter when I caught sight of ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions: My Fortysomething Years in Hollywood"" by Oscar winner Ed Zwick. Filmmakers, it would seem, are loathe to write traditional biographies. Instead, they take the worlds they've spent their lives creating and invite us even deeper into them. I've read a number of memoirs authored by filmmakers over the years, I am a professional film journalist after all, and the vast majority of them have been rather light on personal revelations yet filled to the brim with cinematic nuggets of insight and wisdom. The same is true here. Ed Zwick is the acclaimed director of such films as Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Legends of the Fall, About Last Night, and Glory among others. He created the television show Thirtysomething and executive produced My So-Called Life. He's worked with a number of the film industry's greats, often discovering them or at least empowering them early in their careers, and over four decades in the industry his projects have claimed eighteen Academy Award nominations (seven wins) and sixty-seven Emmy Award nominations (22 wins). He himself claimed the Oscar for producing Shakespeare in Love, a victory made, perhaps, more sweet by his lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, which he won, after Weinstein tried to squeeze him out. ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions"" is, quite simply, one of the best of the many books I've read written by filmmakers. The book is less a personal memoir than a creative one. Chapters are organized primarily by films, projects, or creative periods and while Zwick doesn't avoid personal revelation neither does he immerse us in it. Instead, Zwick invites us into his creative process as he grows as a filmmaker and encounters the ""self-proclaimed masters-of-the-universe, unheralded geniuses, hacks, sociopaths, savants, and saints"" he's worked with over the years. Refreshingly, he doesn't really hold back whether heaping enormous praise or honestly sharing details regarding his most challenging relationships. We learn about the complex and complicated relationship, for example, that he shared with a fresh off Ferris Bueller's Day Off Matthew Broderick during the subsequent shooting of Glory. While he's quick to share that the two have since made amends, the vivid storytelling makes it clear this was among his most difficult relationships during filming. There were others.Throughout ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions,"" there are others where he shares lovingly, ruefully, or even with some degree of existing exasperation as he truly does reflect upon his hits, flops, and other experiences over the years. I found myself loving nearly every page of ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions,"" though I'll confess I found the ending rather abrupt and perhaps lacking the personality that had filled the pages before it. Yet, this is a minor quibble for a book that informed, enlightened, entertained, and widened my view of Zwick and the cinematic worlds he's created over the years. Each chapter also includes what could almost be called a meditation on the work itself, tidbits and insights and teachings often hard-earned and clearly never forgotten. I'm not always sure why I choose to read a book by filmmakers, however, what I do know is that what I long for is exactly what I've gotten from Ed Zwick's ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions."" Written with tremendous heart and humor, honesty and vulnerability, ""Hits, Flops, and Other Illusions"" is no doubt a must-read for anyone who wants to gain greater knowledge and insight into the creative process and those who commit their lives to entertaining us all.",5.0
111,What Have We Here?: Portraits of a Life,,4.05,"['February', '13,', '2024']","""I have a glass of wine in front of me and am enjoying a warm spring day when I having nothing to do and no place I need to be other than where I am at the moment. Screw the pandemic, the politics, the divisions and name-calling, and the hate that is all we hear about these days."" -- on page 3I was mentioning to a friend the other day that actor Billy Dee Williams has a rare type of crossover appeal - women love him for his suave ladies' man persona (such as his hit '75 flick Mahoghany or a long-running series of Colt .45 commercials); men appreciate him for his part in the classic TV-movie biopic Brian's Song, in which he had memorable chemistry with co-star James Caan; and children (of all ages) recognize him for his swashbuckling role as Lando Calrissian in three of the Star Wars films. Williams' good luck and diligent work ethic but trademark laidback ethos is represented well in his autobio / memoir What Have We Here? - title copped via his smooth introductory dialogue as Lando from way back in 1980 - in which he lovingly details growing up in a nurturing middle-class family in New York City of the 40's and 50's, the struggle of his working actor days throughout the 60's, and the mainstream success he finally achieved in the 70's and 80's. I really enjoyed the many sections on his family - it is apparent that his mother, father, twin sister and grandmother all served as quite the positive and long-lasting influences on him - as well his memories of the various projects that established / solidified his acting credentials. Although it only received a brief mention in the text, I'm glad he referenced his part in the somewhat-forgotten 1983 miniseries Chiefs - based on an early bestseller by Stuart Woods - which is probably my favorite role that he has ever done. As a quietly heroic and recently-appointed police chief in a southern town during the early 60's Civil Rights-era, Williams' character has a great introductory scene in which he stuns the incredulous officers newly under his command with the line ""My name is Tyler Watts . . . but you can call me CHIEF!"" as he slams his badge on the station countertop. Somewhere, Sidney Poitier's Virgil Tibbs is applauding.",4.0
112,Greenlights,"From the Academy Award®–winning actor, an unconventional memoir filled with raucous stories, outlaw wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction.",4.21,"['October', '20,', '2020']","A rambling book with great stories but flawed execution. McConaughey was a C student in college, claiming he was normally an A student but wanted to devote time to real world instead of books, and at the end of this books says he'd rather ""take an experienced C over an ignorant A any day."" Well, this book is a C at best and could have been an A if he would have been less self-satisfied and allowed others to guide him to objective conclusions. Instead it's all about subjective Matthew living his life only as he wants.The good parts are very good--he is a gifted storyteller and this is one of the rare Hollywood memoirs that has a lot of great personal stories in it. Most of them occur before he becomes famous, but halfway through the book something changes. He goes from an average guy to a movie star, and that's when the book (and possibly his personal character) starts to fall apart.If you're looking for insights into his movies you won't find any here. He just lists most of them, more interested in his life experiences. He's like a playful pup that doesn't want to be tied down and runs away to avoid being bored. It's fun to read about his decision to drive an RV around the country and his settling in Austin, Texas. I admire his belief in God, his somewhat conservative nature, and his very pro-life stance in wanting children.There are also many negatives. The title and structure of the book are ridiculous. A waste of a misguided concept. He focuses on supposed ""greenlights,"" yet he doesn't define them clearly and claims everything is a greenlight, whether he manipulates a situation or things just happen to him. Then the pages are filled with his scribbling, journal entries, and one-sentence sayings that often make little sense. This guy is very self-involved and while he does say some interesting nuggets you have to dig through all the crap to get to them. Almost nothing about girlfriends, sex, dealing with other performers, and drug use. And at the start he mentions in a list of life experiences being blackmailed to have sex for the first time and being molested by a man at age 18, then he never says anything about it again.McConaughey also paints a very negative picture of his bizarre parents. He talks positively about them but then gives stories of how mean, rude, violent, immoral, and insulting they were. How he is having his mother live with him now is hard to believe--she comes across as a crazed liar who couldn't be trusted, slamming him even more as he became famous.Which brings us to the biggest problem in the book--the author's belief that lying is totally acceptable, as is stealing, backing out of commitments, and using others for personal gain. His parents taught him all that. He calls it ""outlaw"" rules, where the only right and wrong involves getting caught. So he brags about doing many bad things, and only regrets the few times he is caught. This immoral justification of lying and cheating coming from a guy who claims to be living an honest life. He is delusional but appears to have convinced many others who admire his charming ways of getting what he wants.He's quite a character, and the book is very entertaining. But as he gets near the end he skips most of the last seven years of his life, summarizing it into a couple pages. And the conclusions he draws ignore many of the truths that become obvious to an objective reader of the book--that McConaughey doesn't really have any objective truths he holds to and is just making things up as he goes. While I admire his attractive ability to pivot and go with the flow, it's hard to justify his drug use, thoughtlessness, selfishness, and defense of lying. He needed to notice many more redlights in his life and not interpret so many as greenlights.",3.0

114,A Promised Land,,4.34,"['November', '17,', '2020']","Our expectations for elected officials aren’t always very realistic, and none more than for those elected to the highest office in our country. We’ve never had a perfect President and never will, but there are certain qualities that I believe are essential. Intelligence, a respect for the office and more importantly a reverence for our democracy, a strong sense of responsibility for protecting our nation and its citizens, leadership skills that bring together qualified people in the government, a recognition that we have a role to play as citizens of the world, to name a few. Former President Barack Obama was not a perfect President, but I believe that he embodied all of these things that I expect in a President and I believe that even more now, after listening to this book.No matter what you think about Barack Obama, the man can write! It’s illustrated in this first volume of his memoir, as well as the other books he’s written. There are beautiful descriptions of walking along the promenade from the White House residence to the West Wing, the Rose Garden, the Oval Office, intimate descriptions of his family life, his love for his wife and daughters, his love for his deceased mother and grandparents. My favorite introspective passage is the following quote which I played over and over to be sure I got the words right, but also because they represent in such a meaningful way how he viewed his enormous responsibility. “ I would never fully rid myself of the sense of reverence I felt when ever I walked Into the Oval Office, the feeling that I entered not an office, but a sanctum of democracy. Day after day it like comforted and fortified me reminding me of the privilege of my burdens and my duties. “My favorite parts of the book were early on when he talked about making the decision to run and the stories of the campaign were just so fascinating, funny at times and so informative. Michelle asked him just before he announced that he would run , “Why you?” Obama responded that if he became President, “the world would look at America differently, that kids , Black and Hispanic or kids who don’t fit in will see themselves differently, their horizons lifted, their possibilities expanded .” I enjoyed so much hearing about the grass roots campaign, using the internet, how the field organizers in Iowa worked was just fascinating. With love and respect, he tells of his relationships with David Axelrod, Robert Gibbs, the young Reggie Love and David Pfluffe, who Obama thought was so brilliant that he became his Campaign Manager and so many others. I loved hearing the origins of “Fired up ! Ready to Go ! “ Always prepared, he wrote both a concession and acceptance speech.” The book is also laden with dense discussions on the economic crisis the country was facing when he took office, his first G20 conference, foreign policy, health care and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the war in Afghanistan. I have to admit that there were some chapters where I sped up the audio, but for anyone who is a policy wonk, these might be more interesting. These chapters, though, reflect the complexity of the issues before him and the country at this time. They also reflect the intelligent, pragmatic yet caring ways he approached things.Barack Obama always felt the weight of the office and the responsibility to protect the nation, the huge responsibility of being Commander in Chief, the casualties of troops in Afghanistan, writing letters to their families. He read security briefings every morning, and then had meetings with security staff right after - imagine that ! (Couldn’t help myself.) This narrative reflects part of his first term and I can’t wait for the second volume. I love this man . I cried when he won in 2008, a good, heartfelt cry and I cried when his second term was over, a sad and horrified cry. ( Again , I couldn’t help myself.)

Most of this seems to be either to puff-up her self worth or aid in her slagging off of this or that boss from decades past. She also has this annoying habit of constantly talking about how ""tough"" she is, how ""mean but fair"" she is. Isn't that what any decent journalist is? The only thing I'll take from the book is Sergey Brin's baby shower in 2008, where the rich and famous attendees were forced to choose between wearing nappies or onesies, and could drink expensive vodka dripping from an ice statue's nipple. Normally I don't give one-stars, as I usually abandon these sorts of books before the end, but since I finished this one I'll rate it.1-star.",1.0
119,The Wives: A Memoir,"An Indie Next Pick!“A haunting, beautifully written celebration of found sisterhood.” —Publishers Weekly, starred review“A fearless, engaging, and important memoir.” —Library Journal, starred review“[A] gorgeously rendered peek behind the curtain of military life.” —Booklist, starred reviewA captivating memoir that tells the story of one woman’s experience of joining a community of army wives after leaving her New York City job—a profoundly intimate look at marriage, friendship, and the power of human connection.When her new husband joins an elite Army unit, Simone Gorrindo is uprooted from New York City and dropped into Columbus, Georgia. With her husband frequently deployed, Simone is left to find her place in this new world, alone—until she meets the wives.Gorrindo gives us an intimate look into the inner lives of a remarkable group of women and a tender, unflinching portrait of a marriage. A love story, an unforgettable coming-of-age tale, and a bracing tour of the intractable divisions that plague our country today, The Wives offers a rare and powerful gift: a hopeful stitch in the fabric of a torn America.",3.94,"['April', '9,', '2024']","Release Date April 9, 2024I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir.The author was able to share her life as an army wife and helps to shed light on the trials and tribulations of the army life that spouses experience when their loved one is deployed.Written in a way that non-military individuals can understand, it also allows a connection for those of us who do understand the life because we’ve lived it.I found the genuine connections the author made with other wives to be heartwarming. The relationship aspect with her husband was also a highlight for me. Told in such a way that this feels part novel, part real life, I found myself highly interested from the start.Would highly recomend if you are looking for a memoir that gives you all the feels, pulls your heartstrings and gives you a glimpse at military life.",5.0
120,Me,,4.33,"['October', '15,', '2019']","EDIT: I’m changing this to FIVE stars (from four). I keep recommending it and thinking about it and loving on Elton’s infectious and unique personality. I watched the movie last week and kept adding details where I thought they glossed over and narrating to my husband as we watched (haha sorry husband!) and it made me realize how much his book has stuck with me. Then we saw his concert which was phenomenal and now I just can’t get enough Elton in my life which tells me this book deserves ALL THE STARS!!!!Read the official autobiography: ✅Watch ‘Rocketman’: ✅See Elton John LIVE on his official farewell tour!: ✅“When you reminisce about the good old days, you naturally see it all through rose-tinted spectacles. In my case in particular, I think that’s forgivable, because I probably was literally wearing rose-tinted spectacles at the time, with flashing lights and ostrich feathers attached to them. But if you end up convincing yourself that everything in the past was better than it is now, you might as well give up writing music and retire.”This was marvelous. What an unapologetic, authentic, entertaining autobiography. I literally laughed out loud on more than a few occasions and even shed a few tears. I only wish I was more familiar with artists from the 1960s and 1970s so I could have had more context. I think for anyone who grew up listening to Elton and his peers, and even if you didn’t, this book will blow you away.Here’s hoping our show isn’t a “very occasional” one ☺️“I’ve played with my childhood heroes and some of the greatest artists in the history of music; I’ve played with people who were so hopeless they had no business being onstage and I’ve played with a group of male strippers dressed as Cub Scouts. I’ve done gigs dressed as a woman, a cat, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, a Ruritanian general, a musketeer, a pantomime dame and, very occasionally, I’ve played gigs dressed like a normal human being.”",5.0
121,"Reality Check: Making the Best of The Situation - How I Overcame Addiction, Loss, and Prison",,4.38,"['December', '19,', '2023']","This book was the 2nd of my “24 Memoirs in 2024” and it is favorite so far. I was in my mid 20’s when Jersey Shore exploded on televisions everywhere. I was not a fan of Mike “The Situation”. I thought he was an arrogant jerk. I was into the first few seasons of Jersey Shore but then my interest faded. I wasn’t even interested in the revival that happened years later with Jersey Shore Family Reunion.Fast forward to 2019, I’m lying in bed recovering from a root canal infection and I see a Jersey Shore Family Vacation marathon on tv. I think to myself, “What the hell? I have nothing better to do.” I didn’t know if it was the fever from the infection or what, but all of a sudden I saw Mike in this new light. Who is this mature, respectful man I see? Big Daddy Sitch, that’s who. This memoir made me gasp, laugh, recoil, and cry. But, that’s what any good memoir will do to you. His story is told in an incredibly honest and painful way. As someone who has had family members that struggle with addiction, I could relate to nearly every character in Mike’s story. Feeling sympathy for Mike, wishing throughout the book that he’d get the help he needed. Feeling the frustration from family members as they relive each drug addled episode like the Groundhog Day from hell. Feeling profound disappointment when he was sentenced to prison after turning his life around. And feeling hope when Mike recited one of his many mantras, “Calm seas never made a good sailor”.If memoirs are your jam, please pick up this book. If you know and have seen Mike since the beginning of Jersey Shore, you will understand him completely after reading this book.Long Live Big Daddy Sitch.",5.0

123,"The Exvangelicals: Loving, Living, and Leaving the White Evangelical Church",The first definitive book that names the massive social movement of people leaving the white evangelical church—the exvangelicals,4.24,"['March', '19,', '2024']","As a member of what I consider the Christian Left, I often wonder if I’m reading the same Bible as the Evangelicals that follow Trump. Where is the compassion for our fellow man? Where is the concern, not just for an embryo, but also the child? So, I was interested to see what Sarah McCammon had to say about the supposed growing number of younger people leaving the movement. I think one of the important things she says is that it’s not just a religious sect, it’s a community and a culture and leaving it often leads to the loss of family and friends. McCammon walks the reader through the mindset of the Evangelical culture, especially the belief that the Bible is infallible, scientists are not to be trusted and only they know the “truth”. She spends a lot of time on their refusal to believe in evolution. It actually gave me a better understanding of how so many can fall for Trump’s claptrap. When your belief system doesn’t allow for any wavering or skepticism, for any allowance for change, it makes it more plausible that you’ll only accept the “facts” that suit your narrative, regardless of their accuracy. “Information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe’s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. ‘Good for our side’ and ‘true’ begin to blur into one.”The one problem I had with the book is that she never really makes her case for “the massive social movement” of people leaving the evangelical church. She cites individuals and their reasons - LGBTQ+ issues, women’s roles, sexual freedom and corporal punishment. But I never got a sense of how many people she was talking about. Likewise, while I found the section on religious trauma enlightening, I was curious to know how widespread it was. Maybe there’s no way to know. But I would have been interested to know if there were any studies. This is probably a book that will “preach to the choir”. I can’t envision many still firmly invested in the evangelical movement reading it. But maybe it will provide a sense of community to those who have left but feel they’re alone in their situation. I was impressed by the number of folks she mentions that have social media presences. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.Update - this book is really sticking with me. I find myself recommending it right and left.",4.0
124,Yearbook,,4.17,"['May', '11,', '2021']","This essay collection is a fucking delight. The stories are incredibly funny and the hilarity builds to a crescendo with an essay about meeting musicians. I rarely laugh out loud while reading even very funny books but this one has me cracking up over and over and waking up my wife. There are a lot of interesting observations about fame, drugs, coming of age, and the like. The authorial voice is the strongest part of this book. Rogen knows he is a good storyteller and it shows, throughout. This is one of those collections of personal essays that are personal but impersonal. I respect it! Boundaries are good but there are places where I would have appreciated more personal insight or getting to know about the man behind the humor. What I’m saying is that there isn’t an essay about pottery and I would have loved to read about how he got into throwing clay. As an aside, I would also love to read an essay or book from him on screenwriting and storytelling.Anyway, like I said, a fucking delight and there is a level of self-awareness and an acknowledgment of privilege re: consuming weed as a white man that I appreciated.

125,The Diary of a Young Girl,,4.19,"['January', '1,', '1947']","Why do we write reviews?You have a lot of reasons I guess.But for this review there is only one. I am writing this for my conscience. Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with-DO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresome.I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world. No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now?Well she didn’t survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back.",5.0
126,Becoming,,4.46,"['November', '13,', '2018']","Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-	Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”-	Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?-	Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-	Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-	Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?-	Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite” -	Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?-	Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-	Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).-	Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.-	Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-	Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-	Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.-	Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-	Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”-	“Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97-	“Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97-	“I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97-	“Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99-	“There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99-	“He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101-	“Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103-	“He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105-	“Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105-	“Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111-	“This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112-	“I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117-	 “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123-	“All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131-	For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-	She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-	Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-	She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-	She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-	She failed the bar exam the first time around-	She very much dislikes politics-	She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-	She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-	Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-	She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.-	She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”. That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.	As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. 	Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the pussy” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.",3.0
127,Educated,,4.47,"['February', '20,', '2018']","On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.

I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers’ award is a really exciting one.

128,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,,4.49,"['November', '15,', '2016']","I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart's successor on 
The Daily Show
. I inherently knew that they wouldn't pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart's, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he'd be able to tough it out and show the stuff—comedic and otherwise—of which he was made.After reading 
Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood
, I realize that I needn't have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media's eye, he'd have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!!""On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.""Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn't be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn't walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way.""She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.""
Born a Crime
 provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn't white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah's day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It's also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other.More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends).I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on 
The Daily Show
. This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn't go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show—other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap.I've heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah's story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn't heavy-handed; it's fun, insightful, and very compelling.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.",4.0
129,I'm Glad My Mom Died,,4.47,"['August', '9,', '2022']","Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that. Do read this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars",4.0
130,Bossypants,,3.96,"['April', '5,', '2011']","Tina Fey's Bossypants was a disappointment. I don't know that expecting much from a comedy writer's cash-in big-font-with-pictures essay/memoir...thing...is fair, but I've been a Tina Fey fan since 30 Rock began, ready to trust her literary aspirations, and even to me this book barely scratches onto the two star plateau.What did I expect? Well, it's probably easier to explain what I didn't expect. I wasn't counting on a sour, muddled, defensive screed against anyone who pissed off the author in the last thirty years. I wasn't hoping for forced, obvious stories about the professional discrimination in Fey's history. I wasn't looking forward to insecure ramblings about the long hours she put into Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. And I definitely wasn't expecting all of the above to be sugarcoated by a combination of weak, insecure meta-analysis and self-conscious “oh, I'm really not that great” coverups. You know why Bossypants bugged me? Tina Fey has nothing for which to apologize. She's smart, she's funny, and she's talented. So I assume this book had some sort of cathartic impact and she needed to get this bile out of her system. Bossypants gets credit for three short, quality sections. First, Fey tackles the “what's that scar on your face?” question right up front and follows with some funny, interesting commentary on how she can gauge people by how they respond to the scar. Second, she answers a few critical emails/blog comments as a “question and answer” chapter. Third, she walks the reader through a detailed analysis of the whole “I look like Sarah Palin” era. I read this book quickly, over two nights, and while Bossypants is well-written, for the most part, the subject matter's dour nature left me cold, oh, 75% of the time.Listen. I didn't pick this book up whispering, under my breath, “Make me laugh right NOW, Tina Fey! Dance, monkey, dance!” But I feel like Tina Fey wrote this book for 1) young women she's trying to inspire, and 2) all the people who hate her who will never read this book, anyway. Maybe 41 year old white guys weren't her target audience. I can live with that. I'll still watch 30 Rock, though, and not just because she's hot. I just hope next time Fey writes a better book.",2.0
131,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,,4.29,"['January', '1,', '1969']","I must confess I've read precious little Angelou in my time, but I'll never forget the day she tipped me $20.It was some random gray day in Marquette, Michigan, must've been the winter of '00, and I was washing dishes as usual at the downtown Landmark Inn. Someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, ""hey, there's a VIP coming in, put on your bellboy hat and head out front."" I didn't put on my bellboy hat because I didn't have one — just the same dirty, drenched apron I wore every day in that year or two between high school and college, at least whenever I wasn't sitting in my shitty little apartment, or else wasting time and brain cells someplace else.Stepping out into the sub-zero winds, I saw before me the grandest tour bus I'd ever seen in my whole entire life. Even to this day, I've still yet to see a grander one. In fact, the only thing grander than the bus itself was the mink coat on the elderly black woman exiting it, and I'll never forget the words she spoke to my soaked skinny ass, there on the frozen sidewalk of my youth:""Boy, you'll catch yo' death out here""If I'd remained outdoors another hour or so, I suppose I may've proven her right. Instead, I hauled her six or seven massive bags inside, into the elevator, and up to her room on the fifth floor of the historic Landmark Inn.Maya Angelou tipped me $20, and I never even read her fucking book.",
132,The Autobiography of Malcolm X,,4.36,"['October', '29,', '1965']","“I’ve had enough of someone else’s propaganda. I’m for truth, no matter who tells it. I’m for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I’m a human being first and foremost, and as such I’m for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.”  - Malcolm XIn High School my history syllabus covered just a few pages on African-American civil rights heroes. The majority of those pages were on Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X was barely mentioned. After reading this book I was perplexed! I wonder why Malcolm X hasn't been given the same respect as Dr. King; he contributed so much to the civil rights movement as well, yet my knowledge on this man was very minimal.How did Malcolm Little become Malcolm X aka El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz? This is what this book is all about. His transformation was remarkable especially as he spent time in foster homes and was a hustler in Detroit. He lived in an America where smart black kids were discouraged from being lawyers etc, and thus dropped out of school at young ages. It made me think for the umpteenth time just how can society malign and vilify black people, especially black men, when society itself is responsible for restricting them in the first place?Among the many things I admired about Malcolm X was his thirst for knowledge. He is a great advertisement for autodidactism and how effective and transformative self-education can be:  “I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there, in prison, that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive.” It was hard for me to read this book and not compare Malcolm X’s philosophy to Dr. King’s. I always thought I would adhere more closely to Dr. King’s peaceful, nonviolence philosophy, but after reading this book I do agree with Malcolm X’s ideology as well. Not that I am advocating violence, but radicalness and action is sometimes needed, as are anger and indignation. As Malcolm X said, ““So early in life, I learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise.” I feel there is so much to learn from both men so I won’t say I prefer one doctrine over another. At the same time I wonder, how can people not become militant and revolutionary after having experienced so much cruelty and discrimination?Another thing I found interesting in this autobiography was Malcolm X’s religious transformation; from having been raised Christian, to entering the Nation of Islam (NOI), he finally found his spiritual home in “mainstream” Islam. His depiction of his trip to Mecca in particular was very enlightening and a turning point in his life. His adoration of Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the NOI, was quite sad, especially as Muhammad seems to have been a bit of a weirdo. Muhammad said something along the lines of too-short women marrying tall men and vice versa is ridiculous. Also, he said that a man should ideally marry a woman half his age plus 7 years. Malcolm is unapologetic about his views in this book and that's what I love best about this autobiography. His writing is very candid and so informative. This is an important book for all to read. The prevalence of eurocentrism in the world is astounding and I don’t think we really realize just how established it is. Malcolm X dissected the race problem so well, I felt inspired.",5.0
133,I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban,,4.15,"['November', '1,', '2012']","Reading this book reminded me of how much I take for granted every day: Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion. The freedom to go to the store without needing a male escort. And the ability to get an education, regardless of gender.""I was a girl in a land where rifles are fired in celebration of a son, while daughters are hidden away behind a curtain, their role in life simply to prepare food and give birth to children.""Malala, who is now 16, is an outspoken advocate for girls to have the same right to go to school as boys. In her native Pakistan, she lost that ability when the Taliban took over: ""I was 10 when the Taliban came to our valley ... It seemed to us that the Taliban arrived in the night just like vampires. They appeared in groups, armed with knives and Kalashnikovs ... They looked so dark and dirty and that my father's friend described them as 'people deprived of baths and barbers.'""The Taliban started bombing schools and decreed that girls couldn't get an education. Malala's father was a school principal and encouraged her to speak out. She was only 15 at the time, but threats were made against her and her family. And in October 2012, when she was riding the school bus with her friends, a man with a gun climbed aboard the vehicle and shot Malala in the head.Amazingly, Malala survived the bullet and was able to recover. She and her family currently live in England, but Malala writes about how much she misses her home country and wishes she could return to be with her friends. Her graciousness was such that she did not wish revenge on her attacker, and instead prays for peace.""I thank Allah for the hardworking doctors, for my recovery and for sending us to this world where we may struggle for our survival. Some people choose good ways and some choose bad ways. One person's bullet hit me. It swelled my brain, stole my hearing and cut the nerve of my left face in the space of a second. And after that one second there were millions of people praying for my life and talented doctors who gave me my body back. I was a good girl. In my heart I had only the desire to help people.""Malala's story is both heartbreaking and inspiring. I admire her courage and her tenacity, and also hope that her country will one day find peace. ""Why are we Muslims fighting with each other? ... We should focus on practical issues. We have so many people in our country who are illiterate, and many women have no education at all. We live in a place where schools are blown up. We have no reliable electricity supply. Not a single day passes without the killing of at least one Pakistani.""The book is lovingly written, and I also appreciated her stories about the history of Pakistan and her people, the Pashtuns. While reading the book I realized that I knew more about the history of other countries in the region, such as Afghanistan, Iran and India, than I did about Pakistan, and it was very informative. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in women's rights, current events, history or inspirational memoirs.""Today we all know education is our basic right. Not just in the West; Islam too has given us this right. Islam says every girl and every boy should go to school. In the Quran it is written, God wants us to have knowledge. He wants us to know why the sky is blue and about oceans and stars ... The Taliban could take our pens and books, but they couldn't stop our minds from thinking.""Update October 2014:I was thrilled to hear that Malala had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. I have recommended this book to numerous people in the past year, and am still amazed by her courage. Three cheers for Malala!",5.0
134,The Glass Castle,THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER,4.31,"['January', '1,', '2005']","My sister saw The Glass Castle on my coffee table and said, “Oh, I read that. It’s kind of . . .” then she paused and we both were awkwardly silent for a minute. “Well, I was going to say, it’s kind of like us, a little bit, but not –““Yeah,” I said. “I wasn’t going to say it – because not all of it – ““Yeah, not all of it.”We didn’t talk about it again. When I first saw this book, I think I died a little inside because of the cover. I didn’t hate The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood like I hated The Mermaid Chair or (*shudder*) Bastard out of Carolina, but when there’s a little girl on the cover of a book, looking all innocent, it’s like a movie with the word “Education” in the title. You just know you’re in for a published trip to the psychiatrist’s couch. Kiddy-sex and soul-searching. I’m not saying people shouldn’t tell their stories (I mean, look at me, I’m all up in your website telling my stories), but I do think people should get a handle on what their story is before they try to tell it. Or at least before they make me read it. Sorry, that’s kind of asshole-ish of me to say, but I just think a lot of books with innocent little girls on the cover are really arrogant. They have this sense that since some man did something horrifying, everything that women do, including dancing around a fire with girlfriends or taking exotic lovers, is just part of the loving circle of nature’s healing. I am such a fan of women, and so I take it personally when we look like morons. This book has absolutely nothing in common with its cover. I haven’t written a review of it before because I think it is a perfect book, and how do you review a perfect book? I’m like Wayne and Garth when they meet Alice Cooper. This book is my Alice Cooper. I’m sure it wouldn’t be everyone’s Alice Cooper, but to me this is exactly what a book should be. Everything about the book is simple, concise, and action-packed. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. The people are incredible, but deep and smart and human. In some ways, I think this book is the Great American Story, but it’s the story none of us talk about and all of us live. In other ways, the book is so specific and personal to the Walls family that I never would have imagined the stories if I had not been told them. Virginia Woolf and Rainer Maria Rilke, two of the wisest people I have read, both ask when and how women will be able to tell stories without being self-conscious that they are women. How can we write, or even live, not as reactions to men, but as separate masters of our own experiences? I don’t know where the genders are on the space/time continuum of respecting each other, and I think there are probably gender-related specifics to any story (maybe that’s just natural and not even bad), but there is something about this book that is just human and strong. It is compassionate and unflinching. Oh, I hate adjectives. Just, read the first chapter of this book, and if you don’t think it’s compelling, don’t keep reading because it’s probably not for you. My family was nomadic, like Jeannette Walls’s family, but, like I say, all of her stories, and my stories, are unique. When I last lived with my parents, it struck me that we never really understand other people’s relationships with each other. I grew up, probably as many of us did, thinking that my parents never really got along and that my mom was a victim of my dad’s anger and wild scheming. But, later, I realized they probably both got something that I never understood out of their relationship. I think a lot of this book is about how we know the people we are close to and, also, never really do – how it is useless to hold other people to our own standards of what love or responsibility looks like. But, still, it is about holding each other responsible. Or, maybe the book is just about her family with no real moral lesson at all. Walls is so loyal to her stories in an almost scientific way. None of the adult outrage that contaminates so many stories of children creeps into Walls’s. She tells you what happened, and maybe how she felt about it at the time, but she doesn’t impose emotion on the reader. Here’s just a small part (well, actually, half . . . I couldn’t resist) of the first chapter to give you a little taste:Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She’d made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men’s shoes. She’d washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. “It’s my baby girl!” she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. “A little snack for later on,” she explained.We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. “You know how I love my seafood,” she said.She started talking about Picasso. She’d seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn’t really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.“I’m worried about you,” I said. “Tell me what I can do to help.”Her smile faded. “What makes you think I need your help?”“I’m not rich,” I said. “But I have some money. Tell me what it is you need.”She thought for a moment. “I could use an electrolysis treatment.”“Be serious.”“I am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good.”“Come on, Mom.” I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. “I’m talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better.”“You want to help me change my life?” Mom asked. “I’m fine. You’re the one who needs help. Your values are all confused.”“Mom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago.”“Well, people in this country are too wasteful. It’s my way of recycling.” She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. “Why didn’t you say hello?”“I was too ashamed, Mom. I hid.”Mom pointed her chopsticks at me. “You see?” she said. “Right there. That’s exactly what I’m saying. You’re way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it.”“And what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?”“Just tell the truth,” Mom said. “That’s simple enough.”It’s been a while since I read this book, so a lot of the stories aren’t fresh in my mind, but some are so vivid to me that I think of them whenever I see a trash can or think of the desert. In high school, I thought that American history was the most boring topic imaginable. Then, in college, I took a class called the History of Women in the U.S., and I realized that I think the history of industry and conquest is mind-numbing, but the history of actual people is riveting. The Glass Castle is a real, honest history (or as honest as histories can be) of people in America. It is so close to me and so foreign in just the way this country is. It is also, in a way, a tribute to family oral histories. My dad has a . . . loose . . . relationship with the truth, as I’ve probably mentioned on this site before. In the past couple of years, every time I see one of my siblings, we sit around and tell stories from my dad or about my dad, trying to weed out what actually happened, what got a nice polish in the story factory, and what is an outright lie. I get that same feeling from this book – of siblings sitting around and saying, “Do you remember . . .” and “You weren’t there this one time . . .” or “No, that’s just what Dad said happened, what actually happened was . . .” I’m sure someday, my siblings and I will put together a history of our own, since every one of us seems to have inherited the storytelling gene. Whatever I write will be in some way inspired by this book.",5.0
135,Night,,4.37,"['January', '1,', '1956']","The author, who is actually in the above picture, said it best in the forward; “Only those who experienced Auschwitz know what it was.” I think we can all agree with that. But can we, the reader, even understand what happened there? Can modern men and women comprehend that cursed universe? I’m not entirely sure.I first read this in my eighth grade History class. I was 13. It changed my life. Before this book my world was sunshine and rainbows. My biggest concern was whether or not a boy named Jason liked me back. I got mad at my mom when she made me go to bed on time, I complained if I didn’t like what we were having for dinner and I argued about what I was and wasn’t allowed to watch on TV. I thought I knew about WWII. Both of my grandfathers served in it and so my parents wanted to make sure that we understood the sacrifices they made, the things they saw. I watched documentaries about it with my father, the history nerd, listened to the few stories that my grandfathers would tell, but up until that point I had been intentionally sheltered from the horrors of the holocaust. I had only been told in the vaguest terms what had happened, that so many millions of people had been killed, that Hitler and his men had sought to exterminate the Jewish people. My parents wanted to spare me from what exactly that meant until they thought I was mature enough to be able to absorb it. But then I read this. And for the first time in my life I was completely self-aware. I felt like a child, like a complete and utter fool. For what were my “problems” compared to those of this narrator? How “hard” was my life compared to what he endured? What millions of people similarly endured? I now understood my own insignificance in the grand scheme of things and suddenly the reality of the world was a crushing weight. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. It was dark. It was ugly and unforgiveable. I remember getting really angry when I finished this. Mostly I was angry at the world and at humanity as a whole but I unfairly turned some of that on my father. After all, he hadn’t prepared me for what I found in this book. At one point I even demanded that he explain this…thing to me. He couldn’t. Fifteen years later, my second read of this book has impacted me just as much as the first. There’s this question I kept asking myself while reading. That question, was ‘How?’. I’m sure that ‘Why?’ might seem the more obvious choice here but I couldn’t let myself wander down the rabbit warren that is that question. Madness lies at the end of it. So I’m left with ‘How?’. How did this happen? How did so many average human beings contribute to this? How did the SS working in the camps reach the point that they were physically and mentally able to toss live infants into flames? How were the German girls that lived within smelling distance of Auschwitz able to pass love notes to the soldiers that marched their skeletal prisoners past? How did these same starving prisoners manage to run 20 kilometers in the freezing snow? How could the SS officers that shot them if they stopped on the first day of their death march then shout encouragements to them the next? How could the German citizens near the train tracks throw bread into the prisoners’ cattle cars just to watch them murder each other for it? How could human beings do these things to each other? How? HOW? 
HOW???
 Like my father, I have no answers.And that, I believe, is why many modern humans will never really be able to comprehend the things that happen in this book. Absorb it, yes. Bear witness to it, yes. Understand it? Hopefully never. I finished this at lunch today. And now I’m sitting in my cubicle, glancing at my neighbors and wondering if they’re capable of this kind of depravity. Am I? What would I do to survive? Would I beat my own father to death for the bread in his hand? I hope to God that none of us will ever have to find out the answers to these questions. If you read a single book in your life, this should be it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest",5.0
136,Yes Please,,3.85,"['October', '28,', '2014']","This is not a comedy book. I mean, it's funny. Amy Poehler can't write a book and not be funny, because she's Amy fuckin' Poehler. But (and this is not the first time I'm going to compare the two memoirs) where Tina Fey's Bossypants contained humorous essays written specifically for the purpose of being funny, Poehler's does not. Everything is presented in a straightforward, matter-of-fact, fashion, and although a lot of the book is very, very funny, it never seems like this was the specific goal behind the essays. This is also not a book about comedy. Although Amy Poehler discusses her time on improv groups in Chicago and New York, Saturday Night Live, and Parks and Recreation, she never gets more in-depth than ""then we moved to New York and started working at this theater."" Her time on SNL is reduced to a chapter of brief (but fantastic) anecdotes. Amy Poehler is renowned for her ability to play vastly different characters - somewhere on the internet is a photo gallery of all her Second City characters - but she never discusses what goes into each character. The closest we get is this description of her preparing her Hillary Clinton imitation and finally getting a bead on the character by playing her as someone who is tired of always being the smartest person in the room. Okay, so it's not a comedy book, and it's not a book about comedy, and it's really not even much of a memoir - Poehler does not discuss her divorce because ""it is too sad and too personal. I also don't like people knowing my shit."" So what, exactly, is Yes Please?It feels weird to classify this book as a self-help book. But that's what I got out of it. Maybe your experience with Poehler's book will be different, but as I was reading it, the parts that left the greatest impressions on me are the ones where she is demonstrating how to be a good person. The title itself references this - Poehler spends some time discussing how the improv rule of always replying with ""yes, and..."" is also a good rule for life, and how she tacks ""please"" onto that because Amy Poehler is truly, genuinely, wonderfully nice, and that's always refreshing. But lest you think she's some kind of pushover, rest assured that Amy Poehler is also a badass who gets what she wants, and if you pay attention, she can teach you how to do that:""When someone is being rude, abusing their power, or not respecting you, just call them out in a really obvious way. Say, 'I can't understand why you are being rude because you are the concierge and this is the part of the evening where the concierge helps me.' Act like they are an actor who has forgotten what part they are playing. It brings the attention back to them and gives you a minute to calm down so you don't do something silly like burst into tears or break their stupid fucking glasses.""She also teaches you how to be good at what you do, in a very good essay called ""Treat Your Career Like a Bad Boyfriend"":""Now, before I extend this metaphor, let me make a distinction between career and creativity. Creativity is connected to your passion, that light inside you that drives you. That joy that comes when you do something you love. That small voice that tells you, 'I like this. Do this again. You are good at it. Keep going.' That is the juicy stuff that lubricates our lives and helps us feel less alone in the world. Your creativity is not a bad boyfriend....You have to care about your work but not about the result. You have to care about how good you are and how good you feel, but not about how good people think you are or how good people think you look.""I don't want to imply that this is all heavy, here's-how-to-be-a-successful-person stuff. There's lightness in this book, and like I said, it's funny and fluffy, but there's a solid gold center deep within this seemingly light read that makes it stand out from other comedy memoirs I've read. I treated this book as a manual on how to become Amy Poehler, and there are worse things we could be. Have I mentioned that Amy Poehler is nice? She's so nice. She does the same thing Tina Fey did in her book where she lists a lot of the people who work on her TV show with her and it's basically an excuse for her to gush over how much she likes the people she works with (she calls Aubrey Plaze ""a big-hearted warrior""). She spends a long chapter talking about her sons and how much she loves them. Tiny Fey's book featured a chapter called ""We Don't Care if You Like It (One in a Series of Love Letters to Amy Poehler)."" Amy Poehler's book returns the favor by including an acrostic poem about Tina Fey, which might seem disingenuous, but it's clear on every page how much these two great people love each other:""Sometimes Tina is like a very talented bungee-jumping expert. All it takes is for Tina to softly say, 'We can do this, right?' and I suddenly feel like I can jump off a bridge.""I don't know how you guys reacted to that line, but when I read it I had to put the book down and immediately send a text to my best friend telling her I loved her. That's the effect Amy Poehler's book had on me: it taught me how to do what I wanted, how to feel good about myself, how to deal with whatever terrible things life throws at you, and it reminded me to be kind. And it's pretty fucking funny, so there's that.",5.0
137,When Breath Becomes Air,,4.40,"['January', '12,', '2016']","I finished the book and I'm glad that I perservered with it. It's quite an odd book and an overall rating might be the sum of the parts, but is not going to reflect the writing or content of those parts. Ratings, part I, 1 star, part II, 3 stars and part III, 5 stars.The first part, the foreword, by Abraham Verghese, was verbose, hagiographic and contradictory ie. full of shit. He said he didn't know the author at all until after his death. Then he says well he did meet him and they had a long email correspondence. And so it goes. He says it's the foreword but should be the afterword. Verghese must have sat there with a thesaurus composing endless sentences of praise for the author, who had, like most of us, never accomplished anything much out of the ordinary. I dnf'd this part and give it a whole, rounded-up 1 star.The second part, I feel churlish writing this, I really do. The author had an interesting career in his short life, mostly as a student. He had a MA in English Literature, another MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, a BSc in Human Biology and finally an MD from Yale, before going on to be a neurosurgeon. It was in his brief career as a neurosurgeon and scientist he was diagnosed with cancer. He tried his best to be introspective and give guidance through the exponentially-increasing awfulness that is the journey through this dread disease. The problem was, he wasn't a natural writer although he'd wanted to be one all his life. His prose might have been just the stuff of essays at his Ivy League universities, but to me it was reminiscent of a writers' group where each attempt to outdo the other with portent-laden phrases and lots of deep literary references. It was tedious in parts. But... he did his best and he was a good doctor, husband and father, and this was only his debut book. Five stars for the man, but three stars, just, for this central section of the book.The long afterword was written by his widow. She is a doctor too, but could easily be a writer. She just has 'it' and her late husband, who wanted it so much, didn't. She rounds out the story he told, and continued on at length in the most interesting and well-written part of the book. Her ability to convey emotion without getting either lyrical or sappy was excellent. Five stars. Dr. Lucy Kalanithi should have been credited as co-author. I hope she goes on writing.It won't make sense to read the last part without the second, but you can easily skip the foreword, all it adds is unnecessary verbiage and lots of pages to make it look more than just the thin tome it really is.________________An example of the really rather awful writing that got me down. You may disagree, you may feel that the three words I suggest - dawn came up, are no substitute for the 150 poetic, lyrical, descriptive ones the author wrote instead. I'm too hard, right? ""And then we would sit and watch as the first hint of sunlight, a light tinge of day blue would leak out of the eastern horizon, slowly erasing the stars. The day sky would spread wide and high until the first ray of the sun made an appearance. The morning commuters began to animate the distant south Lake Tahoe roads but craning your head back you could see the day's blue darken halfway across the sky and to the west the night remained yet unconquered. Pitch black, stars in full glimmer, the full moon still pinned in the sky. To the east the full light of the day beamed toward you. To the west, night reigned with no hint of surrender. No philosopher can explain the sublime better than this, standing between day and night. It was as if this was the moment God said, ""Let there be light.""Very poetic, very beautiful image. So anyway, dawn came up.",3.0
138,Spare,,3.86,"['January', '10,', '2023']","This is the most difficult review I’ve ever written. So much so I had 4 attempts at writing it, and in the end scaled back much of what I wanted to say (including 17 of my most important themes and issues), to just a core few. Unlike Harry I deliberately tried to moderate what I have to say, which is incredibly challenging when reviewing this memoir. It is also especially challenging but important to keep your review concentrated on what is actually written in this book (including its publicity) and for that reason, I have made great efforts to set aside what I know and what I'm hearing, because to review this honestly it is important to ignore the rumour mill and the other news stories, and set aside your own perceptions. So my comments are based on what Harry has written in his book and in part his media circus surrounding its publication. All in the name of privacy.The reality is this. I too can highlight the many holes and inaccuracies in Harry’s stories, dates, and his own conflicting verbiage. I too can lash out at his many frivolous and insulting remarks that were so unnecessary and excruciatingly petty. I too can argue that many of Harry’s claims are based on his perception and personal choice and do not come with a fact base or credible evidence. However, my dislike of this fictional story goes much deeper, is much more fundamental and gets to the heart of someone’s character, their motives, and principles or lack of. Now you can see why I struggled with this so much, yet much of my own personal views will remain private.Regardless of which side you take on this, everyone that cares enough will find this all very sad. I am sure there are lessons to be learned on all sides in this family saga, and no shortage of regrets. Yet one thing I know for sure, we will never get to the real truth because one side will not resort to the petty and sometimes damaging allegations made by Harry, in this book. So William is nothing but an easy open target because he is part of an establishment that “never complains and never explains”, even when his wife is subjected to abuse from the media (much more than Meghan over the years).The themes and core issuesWhose privacy rules and standards do we follow and when? By writing this book Harry has sought worldwide media attention. He has signed a multiple book deal, featured in the Netflix series and engaged in a number of nonchallenging interviews, which is completely contrary to what he espouses which is privacy. And by doing so he has denied the Royal Family the privacy he supposedly craves. He has broken the privacy rules with regards to the late Queen, the now King, the future King, his stepmother, his sister-in-law, his friends, wider family, and his army colleagues - just about everyone really and that I find incredibly hypocritical. He even has the audacity to complain about his mother’s former butler, Paul Burrell, in the book when he is doing much worse- in his book. This is sheer hypocrisy on a monumental scale. Whose safety do you really care about? The second issue I have is that Harry left the UK to allegedly keep his family safe. I say allegedly because the narrative keeps changing. Even after reading the book, I am still unclear what the current version of events are and what his story is today. At what point will he be or was he telling the truth? Here is my deep concern. By publishing a kill count of 25 Taliban fighter’s aka chess pieces (in his own words) he has increased the risk to himself, his family, and many others in military service. I find this abhorrent and immoral, because every death is someone’s child, father, brother, or friend, and even in war we should respect that. What prudent person publishes a tally? My GR friends may recall, I recently read Diamond Eye, where the MC was a female sniper and whilst a heroine in the eyes of many, she actually kept a body count of her kills which did not sit well with me, for the same reason. Respect. Who does that? Yet once again Harry takes no responsibility and has since tried to change the narrative by blaming the press for manipulating his words despite the fact that this sordid comment is written by him in his own memoir. Diana had two sons, remember that when reading this story. I for one will always remember the heart-breaking image of Diana’s two sons walk behind their mother’s coffin. A life changing event for the boys she loved, which caused mental health issues for BOTH sons growing up, something they jointly opened up about and campaign for. Yet Harry does this publicly to William. Whilst the pain is evident in Harry's story, I ask myself, what mother, and particularly Diana, would be pleased and supportive of a son who has consciously and deliberately set out on a campaign to work against the other. By writing a book that will be forever in print and with allegations that don’t stack up in my opinion, Harry has created this impossible situation for Diana’s eldest son, knowing that William won’t or can’t respond. Does Harry believe that the mother he refers to often in the book would be proud?. William is a soft open target for Harry, which is why I have lost so much respect for Harry having taken this course of action. It would appear he is emotionally obtuse or ill advised or both. Either way someone is on the receiving end and its Diana's eldest son who she was very protective off as the future King. A life she knew would be dedicated to 'service' and 'duty' while Harry had much less restrictions and more freedom. See here is the different lens to 'Spare'.Have you ever tried to warn a family member against their choice? It is not easy but what does a loving sibling do when you have deep concerns? You do what William did - voice your reservations, but unfortunately, this seems to be what sits behind much of this sorry affair. Harry doesn’t want to hear or accept it. From what Harry has shared it would appear these conversations did not go well, and neither son comes out blameless, particularly the one when William allegedly grips Harry’s shirt. A lesson I hope all will learn from. Time will tell who was right though.There was one point in this whole saga that had me seething and sad and its when Harry claims that William recently says …I love you, Harry, on our mothers life I love you… God you can hear the anguish felt by William in those words. Yet Harry admits to throwing it back in William’s face, and then this guy claims he wants a reconciliation. Sorry Harry, as was your response - I don’t believe you and bleep bleep to the rest of what you said here. Disgraceful.I’m in a minority here on GR, by rating this a ‘1’ because most people I know who have a problem with Harry’s behaviour, integrity, and motives for writing this book have chosen not to waste their money or time on it. Which potentially provides a distorted view of UK public opinion, in particular.Comments about the book’s writing style and structureHad Harry thought about what he wanted to achieve from the book, he might have structured the book differently and placed greater emphasis on what was important for us to hear and what was important for the narrative he wanted to share. Instead this came across as an emotional download and mental dump of Harry’s lifelong grievances, and aimed at anyone who had an opposing view. This does not make him a victim, instead the pendulum swung the other way and this overload for the reader just painted him as vengeful and spoilt in my eyes. Yet we do know from our own history that Harry had some genuine issues with the press for example (the press also managed his image during his years of alcohol and drug abuse -which he admits to in the book) but all this was lost amongst so much needless complaints and insults directed towards others, and I just reached saturation point, with little accountability accepted or owned by Harry.Let me explain what I mean about having an objective. For example, if you wanted reconciliation then share the wrongs in a considered and constructive way and explain what it is you hope to fix and then let your actions support that. If you want the world to know you are at peace with yourself, then remove these rantings, because this book has achieved the opposite. If this story was to expose the media as part of your unwinnable war against the press, then why attack William the way you have?. By trying so hard to paint himself as victim, he created too many so called ‘enemies’ that in the end you could see why some people like me could conclude that the common problem here is in fact …. Harry. I am deliberately leaving Meghan out of this review.In terms of writing style, the book felt as though it was written by many different authors. Clipped sentences were replaced with more descriptive prose and much longer sentences, which seemed at odds with a book that had so many chapters. However, it was a stroke of genius to narrate your own story. A very clever marketing accomplishment that no doubt will have lured people and captured the sympathy of many readers. Even I was moved in the early chapters when I relived Diana’s death in particular, but when the venom kicked in and the objectivity was notably missing. Harry lost me.Had a level of sensitivity and maturity been applied to this story I might have responded differently. Had he shown some restraint and not made such unnecessary and insulting remarks about other people, I might have had some sympathy for the unsavoury press coverage he receives. Had I not believed in my heart that this was financially motivated, then I would have reacted differently. Had I not found the level of hypocrisy so distasteful, then I would have appraised this differently altogether. Had I not read Harry’s own words then I might never have been aware that this was in some part or largely driven out of revenge or jealousy, for his older brother and an accident of birth that he was born second. And finally, had Harry applied some level of objectivity then I might have respected some of what he was saying. For example the royal family have chosen a different approach to dealing with the press instead of Harry’s unwinnable war and his 20+ lawsuits. They want to rise above it and often ignore the stories written about them and advised Harry to do the same. Not only does he disagree with them, but he actually accuses them of planting the petty stories, he refers to in his book. Really - just sit back and think about it!!!Unfortunately one of my biggest issues with this book is its credibility. Is the book to explain the narrative? or is the narrative being written to suit and sell a book and his story now?. Had Harry come out at the beginning and stated his case or even hinted at the hurtful and damming accusations he is now making about his family. Had we been given a glimpse of this story he is now pedalling, (with the exception of the media) then the book might have felt more credible, his version more believable. Instead, it feels like it is only after his proposals to become a part time Royal were rejected that he has decided to be angry with his family so much so that he needs to tell the world about it. You would want out of this situation altogether if all this were true - not negotiate a different ‘Royal’ role that would allow you to pursue the celebrity lifestyle and fame that this couple appear to crave. I know what I think but it is up to you to draw your own conclusions.There was something to be said about the mystery and speculation surrounding the RF which allowed people like me to keep an open mind, because I thought there was more to it than what we were being told. Harry has dispelled any of those doubts. There is nothing of substance and no significant revelations that would go any way to justifying and explaining Harry’s betrayal of his family and their privacy.In summaryHarry claims to have secured his personal peace, but at what cost? The cost of betraying his family, army colleagues, friends, and the institution of the monarchy whilst at the same time compromising the privacy and potentially the security of others, including his family. Publishing his body count was immoral and insensitive to those impacted and his military colleagues. The way he has attacked William, feels disproportionate to anything William might have done and if there was something else then I’m sure Harry would have told us. So all of this has exacerbated an already strenuous relationship and makes any kind of reconciliation unlikely, but certainly more difficult. In my view, his gripe over being a ‘spare’ is disrespectful to the institution and the tax payers who support it, Many of us who have witnessed Harry's indulgent and privileged lifestyle over the years, when he was 3rd in line to the throne, will find this discourteous. Harry has had life handed to him on a silver plate, had the best of everything, and lived in some stunning homes. Yet he is that out of touch with the 'public mood' in the UK and so blinkered he would hope you would see him as a 'victim' and justified in ripping his family apart because he has had disagreements with his family, he was born second and had a smaller bedroom in Balmoral castle for example. Enough. Please, no more. Some readers will feel empathy for Harry’s statement that the RF will someday regret not being there for him during the second most difficult period of his life because they failed to defend him publicly. Yet they DO NOT defend themselves, their wives, and the wider family because it is their motto to ‘never complain, never explain’. Not some elaborate plan to oust a couple that could have offered so much. Not a case of treating couples differently as they would have you believe. Perhaps the RF need to reevaluate this motto they live by. Perhaps not because by in large it has prevented them from being embroiled in petty skirmishes with the media, that Harry himself seems intent on having when he’s not using them to support his book or to his own ends. Instead, they have risen above it and not challenged the stories, and if Harry really believes the RF would invest time in sharing stories with the press over lipgloss, a flower girls dress or whether a prince should wear a beard - then I fear for him. So, by publishing this bitter book that is heavily weighted against and critical of William, Harry has likely created the second most difficult time in Williams life and this course of action was deliberate and venomous. You are right, there will be regrets someday and it will be for writing this book. Hopefully you have now exhausted your bile. Now ‘spare’ us any more of this!!!And to remove any notions of bias, as a pro royalist. I am not a Royalist or in favour of keeping a large royal family. Some maybe because of the charity work they do and the causes they champion like William's 'Earthshot' programme, which is the stuff we really should be focused on. I also have issues with the lives of some of the RF but I am not here to comment on those. I am here to respond to Harry's book, his one-sided oxymoronic self indulgent story and his unverified allegations.So please ‘spare’ us anymore of this. Please enjoy your life in America. I sincerely wish you do something meaningful with your life, instead of swapping financial support from the RF with money gleaned from attacking the Royal Family. Having listened to Harry’s story, I have come out of this believing the real victims here are William and Kate. William who conducts himself so well publicly, but is restricted by protocol and Kate who has always remained dignified and classy. A wonderful ambassador for the RF. If only they could tell their side of the story. Yet Harry would have you believe Williams story is out there and this is Harry’s chance to tell his - what an insult to everything we have seen, witnessed and endured. Spare us please. Go live your life.And no more memoirs for me. I found this too challenging but I stand by my considered views that I deliberated over for a long time, although it has still pained me to express them, because Harry was once my favourite Royal.",1.0
139,Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,,4.06,"['March', '20,', '2012']","EDIT 4/4/2014: I changed this from two stars to one, because I realized that it's been about two years since I read this book and I still get ragey and fist-shakey just thinking about how much it sucked. So, bonus star deducted. This book sucks on wheels. Read on for more...Okay. I gave myself plenty of time to cool off before writing this review, because man, was I ever pissed at this book by the time I finished reading it. And I really wanted to love it! I'm a backpacker, and I've often fantasized about doing the PCT solo (a pretty stupid idea for anybody who's not much more experienced than I am.) I was excited about a memoir of one woman's experience on the trail. I dug into this book eagerly, but within a few chapters my enthusiasm began to deflate, and by the end I was basically doing this at every other paragraph:After some cooling-off time, I gave it what I feel is a very generous two stars. That bonus star is for the first couple of chapters, which do in fact pull a person in, and which do share some impressive openness on the author's part. I was particularly impressed with her ability to share her weird dreams about killing her mother, which were raw and real and touching and disturbing. Also, the scene where she recalls how  the horse is ""put down"" was particularly affecting. Otherwise, this book just doesn't have all that much to offer. Cheryl Strayed's life doesn't, so far, have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments -- the kind of things that make for good memoir reading. Or if her life does contain those things, she's not a good enough writer to make the reader feel it. Brief rundown: Strayed lost a loving parent with whom she had a great relationship, and had a very difficult time accepting that loss. Not particularly different from the experiences of many people I've met. As a result of her grief, she lost all impulse control and sabotaged her marriage to a really wonderful man, then started using heroin. Okay, that's a little more interesting, but unfortunately the full impact of these momentous choices is lost in an unblazed forest of vague, unremarkable prose and confused chronology, making it hard to give a damn. At the nadir of her downward spiral, she hears about the PCT and just decides to hike it, which is not surprising, I guess, since she's proudly established that she suffers from a total lack of impulse control (a condition she never really seems to try to correct throughout the course of the book.) So hike it she does, all unprepared, derping off into the wilderness, as is par for the course, apparently. She can't even be assed to read the essential (and very short, I might add) book Staying Found: The Complete Map and Compass Handbook, an absolute essential for anybody who determines to walk off into the wilderness and survive by whatever she can carry on her back. Oh, she bothered to buy the book, but she neglected to read even a page of it on the flight from Minnesota or wherever she's from to southern California, although she brought it on board the plane intending to educate herself BEFORE she began her blissed-out hippie walkabout. But I guess, hey, free peanuts and a bad Adam Sandler movie, so....If you're getting the impression from the review that this memoir fails mostly because Strayed just doesn't make herself a very sympathetic character, you're getting the right idea. But it gets worse. Once she actually gets the high of hiking (under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT, for god's sake) the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature Walk.Everybody -- yes, literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her. She is that irresistible, all hairy and smelling like a sasquatch and hobbling from miles of carrying half her body weight. All the men she meets eye her appraisingly. Most of them hit on her and ask her out for dinner and drinks (wait...dinner and drinks on the Pacific Crest Trail? Yes, more on that later.) One of them actually does seduce her with the erotic power of his Wilco t-shirt. But the one message she clearly wants you to take away from her allegedly inspiring story of a complete personal transformation on the PCT is that the author is preternaturally sexy, and virtually nothing with a penis can resist her. Strayed's relentless hotness actually becomes such a prevalent theme that I began laughing out loud each time she described yet another man expressing his interest in her hot hiker self. I laughed a lot, O Reader. I laughed a lot.Don't worry; those people she met who didn't want to stick their trekking poles into her worshiped her for other reasons. Every single person she met except for some Totally Grumpy Old Camp Hosts and a couple creepy hunters (who still wanted to have sex with her) couldn't stop telling her how amazing and wonderful she was for hiking the PCT alone. Without any knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness. Everyone said things to reinforce her belief that she was a ""badass motherfucking Amazonian queen."" Hooray! The world is your oyster, 'cause that's all the world is!How did she meet so many people hiking one of the least-trammeled of the world-famous trails on the continent? Well, Strayed actually didn't hike all that much of the trail. She started well north of the Mexican border and had to take a Greyhound around most of the High Sierras, because it was socked in that year and she was unprepared for snow hiking, as she was for most other contingencies. (She got rid of her ice axe after crossing one small snowfield, figuring she wouldn't need it again, y'know, where the elevation got higher. Jesus Christ. Not that she really knew how to use an ice axe anyway.) Her intent was to do only the California stretch, not the entire trail, though she did extend the trip through Oregon after she found out about the impassability of the trail (another thing she should have checked on before she started walking.) So she motored through a good 400+ miles of her ""hike,"" and left the trail for various reasons at various points to hitch-hike instead. Thus, she ended up with a lot of non-hiker people in a lot of non-hiking situations, making this more a memoir of disjointed hippie travel-by-any-means than a memoir of HIKING THE EFFING PCT, as all bookbuyers were led to believe.The parts of the book that actually DID take place on the Trail were interrupted by flashbacks to her life with her mother or the destruction of her marriage or her experimentation with heroin or the fallout from these events. So much so, as soon as she began actually talking about the Trail again, I knew to brace myself for yet another forced emotional flashback to the ordinary tragedy of Strayed's typical American life. Now, in spite of the choking Mary Sueism of the author's self-depiction, I could forgive her utter dumbness in wandering onto the PCT unprepared if she actually learned anything about what a bad idea it is to wander into the wilderness unprepared. If her unpreparedness for the PCT taught her how to be a better person, more aware, more focused, more capable, more responsible, more honest about herself, GREAT. Bring on the stupidity. I like a good redemption tale. But it didn't. It didn't! If it did, those passages were lost in editing, or were never written at all. The book's big climax involves Strayed eating a peach in a grove of azaleas, and it's all very pretty and a deer walks into the clearing, and she realizes that it's totally okay to be who she is. And yeah, it's totally okay to be who you are if you're good with that, but she sets up her personal tragedies as a) being unable to cope with loss, b) intentionally destroying her relationship with a very good man, c) doing potentially deadly drugs, d) lacking all impulse control, and the big take-away lesson from her experience on the PCT is...don't ever change? What? The thing she learned from this experience was that it's just fine to fuck up other people's lives, because now she's A-Okay with herself?Come on!But even that...even that I could forgive if the writing were good. I will forgive anything for gorgeous writing. My favorite book of all time is Lolita, and I can forgive the existence of a fictional character like Humbert Humbert because, damn, have you ever read Lolita? (Strayed has, at least once, and apparently learned nothing about the value of lovely writing.) But the writing in Wild is, if you will forgive the pun, pedestrian at best. I suppose it's serviceable enough for a general memoir of an American woman having a typical American experience of loss and confusion and coming to accept her past. But for describing nature? Ugh. I wasn't expecting ""Annie Dillard hefts a Kelty"" from this book, but one would think that a book which alleges to focus on the great transforming power wilderness would at least give a little time or effort to, you know, wilderness. Miles and miles of trail are dismissed in the tritest and most cliche of short sentences, and as far as describing action, Strayed often resorts to such apprentice work as ""we kissed and kissed and kissed""; ""I walked and walked and walked""; ""I cried and cried and cried."" I yawned and yawned and yawned. I raged and raged and raged. The most vivid scene of actual trail action I can recall is where she falls asleep beside a muddy tarn and wakes to the feel of frogs hopping all over her body. The rest of the prose fell utterly flat, particularly in scenes involving nature. What a crashing disappointment. And what a rip-off, since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT. And there is virtually none of that here.It's no surprise to me that this book was selected for Oprah's Book Club (2.0, no less!) Oprah's selections have become, over the years, increasingly vapid and serving only the ""rah-rah, you go girl"" branding of the Club. I remember, long ago in a distant past, when she actually chose books that had good writing and fascinating characters. I should have been warned off by the fact that this book was picked, but I wanted so, so badly to read a well-written memoir about the enchantment of backpacking, about the way the strife and the loneliness and the rawness of nature pull the packer into another realm of existence, where life is fragile and valuable, where the sky and the earth and the line of the trail itself live, and by turns cradle and sustain the hiker and try and reject her. Instead, I got ""gee, my feet hurt."" The great American memoir of the PCT still remains to be written. I'm sad that it's not already here, that I don't get to read it. I'm elated that maybe I'll yet have the chance to accomplish what this book didn't accomplish. Maybe I'll get a chance to write it. I'm already planning my own trip from Mexico to Canada. (Not solo, though. That's just dumb.) Who knows.",1.0

141,Ellie Haycock Is Totally Normal,The Breakfast Club meets Five Feet Apart in this big-hearted novel from debut author Gretchen Schreiber.,3.68,"['March', '5,', '2024']","so first off thank you to netgalley for the digital e-arc of this book! I have many thoughts on this book… a lot good, some bad. I’ll start with what worked for me: 1. Her friends! Phenomenal friends, who showed up for her even when she didn’t want them to (minus Jack he makes me 🤢) 2. The general story. I grew up in a hospital, nearly five years on the endocrinology floor of a hospital. I could relate SO MUCH to a lot of this story. It felt like being sort of seen. I also like the ending where she isn’t like cured and done with her disabilities. That’s not how it works. 3. The characterization of doctors. Like for real, they aren’t always right and sometimes they treat lives as a science experiment. There was a bit too much doctor hate at one point. I don’t really respect people who say “all doctors are evil, stupid, and no good”… there are some AMAZING doctors out there, some who even saved my brother’s life. (That being said there were 1000% some crumby ones, I think this does a fair job of showing both sides). What didn’t work for me: 1. Ellie as a character was too jaded and frankly annoying. I can understand her frustration, I really can, but she is too hateful and angry for me to want to cheer for her. 2. Ellies “non hospital people can’t understand unless they themselves are under the needle” mantra was also not acceptable, and frankly just not true. As someone who has been in this position, you CAN get a group of non medical people to understand. Granted, a lot of people don’t understand, but some real ones do. 3. The romance… I didn’t feel it 🤷🏻‍♀️ 4. The mom/blog storyline. The mom just felt selfish and so did Ellie so I didn’t feel bad for either of them… Overall, I liked the story! But there was too much hatred/anger/selfishness for me to want to read this and get excited for a happy ending, or at least an ending.",3.0

As often is the case, Nhika falls into the trap of being naïve and cliché. She is hoodwinked by multiple people, before coming into her own.As the wave of Vietnamese diaspora fiction continues to hit the shelves, I have been eagerly waiting for more Southeast Asian lore to make its way into my hands. Since I grew up in the West, inundated with Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, and am slowly but surely educating myself on East Asian lore, I find myself searching for the myths of my homeland. This is a start. (Make sure you pick up The Crossbow of Destiny in August.)Where so many of the Asian fantasies seem to go wrong is the glorification of colonization. I will be the first to admit that I was worried about how this would turn out. Fear not, Nhika is very proud to be Yarongese. As she was born in Theumas, she has never even seen her oft dreamt about homeland. She barely speaks the language. She feels unconnected to her mother and grandmother's land and healing practices. This obviously hit me in the feels.Nhika's gift deals with healing. She is from a land of magic. The place she lives deals more with science, and these people see her as other.

Don't fear the reaper...
Tru doesn't know what that message means when she finds it...but with the unsolved mysteries and murders in Mount Orange's past, she KNOWS it can't be good. Aside from losing her sister tragically years ago, Tru has also been saddened and fascinated by the unsolved murders of two teen girls, Bailey and Celeste, and would LOVE to use the resources at her newspaper job to dig down deep into the cold cases...because there's something inside her that tells her that SHE is meant to find the truth...but 
why?
Tru is also hiding a secret from her longtime boyfriend and family...not only does she not plan to go to college with him at FSU in the fall...she's not even sure if this 'perfect' relationship feels right to her anymore. Her one solace is diving, and Tru spends a LOT of her time exploring the deep and looking for answers at the bottom of the water. Enter Rio, a fascinating, beautiful, and mysterious fellow diver, who appears seemingly out of nowhere...and forms an INSTANT bond with Tru.As the two become fast friends, their feelings start to spill into uncharted territory...and Rio reveals that she too feels a pull towards the Bailey and Celeste murders. The girls almost feel as though they were CALLED to this dark exploration...and when they start to reveal facts that only Bailey and Celeste could have known, and an indescribable feeling that they've known each other for many years in a very intimate way...the pieces seem to slowly be coming together. But when they find the aforementioned ""Don't fear the reaper"" note tacked to their tent one night, and hear terrifying sounds in the woods that same evening...it seems like the girls have stumbled upon dangerous information...information SOMEONE would kill to keep hidden. Can Tru and Rio uncover the secret of Bailey and Celeste's demise...
before they get PERMANENTLY swallowed by the deep?
There is something so theatrical and yet accessible about Ginny Myers Sain's books, and with this one as my third read of hers, I've come to expect certain qualities when 'diving' into her stories. 😉 There will be murder, intrigue, the tortured push and pull of teenage friendships (and love stories!), and an atmosphere that ALWAYS leaps off the page...and thrusts me headlong into somewhere completely unexpected...and of COURSE, also very creepy! This time, we land in sunny Florida, and there is certainly enough detail here to bring to mind the almost oppressive humidity found only in the Sunshine State. In this one, Tru and Rio (no coincidence that this is her name, I'm sure! 🌊) also spend a great deal of time on dives and underwater, and these passages also brought the dark and terrifying nature of the Deep to life...and had me holding MY breath each time they went down!Although I enjoyed these two main characters enough, I have to say in this one...I almost felt like TOO many of the 'townsfolk' had been invited to the party. Lots of the characters also have very odd or uncommon names (Derry, for example...and don't get me started on John Boy! 😣) I know we needed a SOMEWHAT larger cast to provide 'suspects' and give some depth to the plot itself, but unlike some of Myers Sain's previous books, this time I felt VERY much like I was reading teenagers...who were acting a LOT like teenagers. Of course, this is fine: this book IS YA, after all. But with so much emphasis on smoking, uh, 'alternative substances', and of course the burgeoning romances (or eroding romances) between several of the characters, it felt like there was almost too much going on at times...and yet, not the sort of events and feelings I WANTED to learn more about as we went along.And then there's of course the paranormal element that is always present in Myers Sain's books, and it WAS present here...but in a muted, downplayed way. Part of this was I think intended to keep the reader guessing (and it absolutely worked!) but I have to admit after lots of buildup and the ENTIRELY unfair and tragic death of one character that I truly liked 😢 the denouement felt like a bit of a letdown and steered sharply away from the groundwork that Myers Sain had laid and the trail of breadcrumbs I had been following...and it's hard to say that I wasn't slightly disappointed. There is also a pretty heavy emphasis on the relationship (?) or not between Rio and Tru, so if you aren't into a bit of romance in your thrillers, I would steer clear.And as to whether Tru can 'tru-ly' trust Rio?It'll be up to YOU to revisit these lyrics after reading and see if they turn out to be true!Love of two is oneHere but now they're goneCame the last night of sadnessAnd it was clear she couldn't go on😳😉4 stars, rounded up from 3.5",4.0

“By you, I am forever undone.”

I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending. Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.) I vlogged this entire reading experience (and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened in The Cruel Prince, The Lost Sisters, & The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later! After the very heartbreaking end of The Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter. 

“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”

Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death. It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted. 

“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”

And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence. 

“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”

Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly. This next section of my review is going to have SPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not read The Queen of Nothing and all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart. 

“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”

 Jude Duarte
 - My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. 

“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - We love a good redemption arc, wow. ➽ 
 Grima Mog
 - Nothing but love and respect for my war general. ➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers. ➽

 - My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking. ➽ 
 Oak
 - Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off. ➽ 
 Madoc
 - Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup. Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying. I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that. 

“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”

I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read. I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie. I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me. Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the way The Folk of the Air has made me feel.

This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
150,The Hawthorne Legacy,"Intrigue, riches, and romance abound in this thrilling sequel to the New York Times bestselling The Inheritance Games perfect for fans of Karen McManus and Holly Jackson.",4.22,"['September', '7,', '2021']","Ma'am this is illegal. I thought you were supposed to make one love interest more lovable than the other NOT HAVE THEM BOTH LOVABLE. okay but that confession at the end🥺🥺My first 5 star in months I'm so happy omgThe Hawthorne Legacy picks up where things were left off in The Inheritance Games with Avery still trying to figure out why the late billionaire Tobias Hawthorne left her his fortune. Whatever the reason, Avery knows the answer has to do with a certain person... and so the investigation begins.

""I couldn't shake the feeling that this life was never meant for me.""

It's just another normal day for Avery Kylie Grambs when the paparazzi are chasing after you trying to get the latest scoop, murder attempts are constantly happening, and your father + the daughter of a billionaire is trying to steal your fortune. And to add on to that, you're dealing with the Hawthorne brothers im jealous. *sigh* What a life to have.I loved Avery in the first book and I loved her even more here like !! the character development !! She goes through some growth by the end of the book and just sfsdfsdfs I loved it. Still really jealous that she has the attention of both Grayson and Jameson😭 Oh and also how she can literally say ""Fine, you can take one of my planes."" Not jealous about the downsides of being a billionaire though.Also I really wonder about that quote above. I feel like by the end of this series Avery will no longer be a billionaire in some way, especially with how many times she kept saying that ""this life isn't meant for me"" ... foreshadowing methinks.

“The trick to being abandoned was to never let yourself long for anyone who left.”

JAMESON I LOVE YOU. In the first book, I was bit iffy with him because of the way he acted but here OMG MY LOVE FOR HIM GREW SO MUCH. He's actually so sweet and caring to Avery, like some scene I was so surprised with Avery sdfsfds he's such a precious cinnamon roll. The moments between him and Avery were everything. *HOT TUB SCENE*THESE MOMENTS ESPECIALLY WERE SO SWEET:""I halfway convinced myself that as long as Avery was just a riddle or a puzzle, as long as I was just playing, I'd be fine. Well, jokes' on me, because somewhere along the way, I stopped playing."" !! he actually does really care about Avery🥺🥺""You don't have to say anything. You don't have to kiss me now. You don't have to love me now, Heiress. But when you're ready... if you're ever ready, if it's going to be me--just flip that disk. Heads, I kiss you."" His voice broke slightly. ""Tails you kiss me. And either way, it means something.""
PLEASE THAT CONFESSION😩😩 my heart cant take it, protect jamie😭

“Grayson Hawthorne was arrogant enough to consider himself bulletproof—and honorable enough to see a promise through to its end.”

You'd think because Grayson didn't have as many scenes as Jameson, I'd love Jameson more obviously, right?? HAHA NO BECAUSE THE VERY FEW SCENES BETWEEN GRAYSON AND AVERY WERE ALSO SO PRECIOUS. Like at this point?? I give up on choosing between the two boys, it's impossible. I just want both of them to be happy by the end of this series😭 LIKE GRAYSON TAUGHT HER HOW TO SKI AND USE A LONGSWORD?? plz I love him so much and the way he's hurting so much over what happened in the past *sobbing* even tho this book ended with avery + jameson, i get the feeling next book's gonna end with avery + grayson, and im fine either way just as long as one of them doesnt end up forever heartbroken or something😭Also I just loved the side characters so much, Xander and Max especially AHH IM SHIPPING THEM. He made her a life-size recreation of the most lovable droids in Star Wards, how is that not so sweet?? Nash and Libby omg I ship too. I was pretty sus about Nash at first but methinks he's alright now, especially after reading the B&N chapters. Also Thea and Rebecca <333 Bex needs all the happiness in the world. Skye can go die🙂OH AND HANNAH AND HARRY?? Their love is so tragic, I actually got really emotional over some of the lines😭😭

""Hate me, if you can, for all the reasons I deserve. But don't hate me for leaving while you sleep. I knew you wouldn't let me go, and I cannot bear to say good-bye.""

They deserved more cri curse certain people.Also shoutout to Oren and Alisa for all the damage control and protecting they had to do for Avery when she screwed up a lot. They definitely deserve a raise in pay. altho they most likely get a lot anways lol

""There are no rules that matter more than winning.”

I know a lot people found THL to be super boring and no plot progression whatsoever but honestly I absolutely adored everything in this book. This is the most invested I've been for a book in literally over 3 months. The mystery was so addicting and the tension !! I'm in love and now cannot stop thinking about this book so THANK YOU JLB <33I'm so hyped for the finale and really sad that soon I'm going to have part from these guys😭 Pleasee don't break any of the Hawthorne boys' hearts, JLB.___Reviews:The Inheritance Games: ★★★★★The Hawthorne Legacy: ★★★★★",5.0

  y'allll when I tell you this line made me- ALEXA PLAY LITERALLY ANY LOVE SONG BY TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE EVAJACKS ARE EVERYTHING AND SO IS TAYLOR SWIFT.(there will be spoilers if you haven't read this book so be wary!)Ok so here we finally are. The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don't even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It's gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it's not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I'll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo's first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke: “He'd never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks's chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let's just say, that's definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let's just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that's true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I'm pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it's cute, because it wasn't, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won't be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I'm still bitter that Tella didn't pop up in a cameo. I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I've already written so much so here's my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much was because of the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she's a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn't as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won't get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I'm messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts's mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don't end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼‍♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don't matter or aren't important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks's story is so good, I can't even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I'm all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn't paying much attention, sooo when I'm less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I'm ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars
“He wanted her to look at him, just once, and know him the way she had before.”

153,Lightlark,,3.80,"['August', '23,', '2022']","EDIT 8/17/2022As someone who dropped one of the first comprehensive bad reviews on this book, I just wanna say I do not support the review bombing of it. It’s tacky and uncouth and what bigots do every time there are women in a TV show. We’re better than this. This situation could been a constructive conversation about the quality of a book, privileges, the highly commercialized state of publishing, the influence of tiktok, or false advertising, and instead we’re having NONE of those. Do not invalidate anyone’s identity. This is unproductive and invasive speculation. Focus on actions, on stuff that’s actually happening. C’mon, be real. _____________________I rarely use GoodReads, but because I received an advanced copy of the book, I thought it best to distribute this review across all platforms where I have an account. You can find me over on the storygraph, username bean. Thanks for the arc btw!Where to begin?I picked up this book because of tiktok. This book got picked up by a publisher because of tiktok. This book is a tiktok success story, an amalgamation of all that tiktok has to offer, and by extension, all the books that are popular on tiktok before it. Calling it pastiche would be kind. Each scene felt very reminiscent of something out of another YA book. Many, many YA books. So much of this book is borrowed from ACOTAR that any differentiation from the plot of ACOTAR felt like a subversion of story even if it made perfect sense within Lightlark's narrative. Also, I can proudly say that any comparison to the Hunger Games is unwarranted. It's a terrible comparison that sets up false expectations. More accurately, it's ACOTAR meets the Selection. Yeah. Before I really lay into this book, I'll say that I understand why people would like it. I understand the appeal. Some people like reading 100 different versions of the same kind of book. I get it. It's comforting. I am also that way with certain genres of books or types of movies. But comfort, familiarity, they're not tangible measures of storytelling quality. It's possible to be comforted and find excitement in something that suffers from flaws. So, make peace with that.I'll work my way up.The building blocks of story are prose. Aster's prose is not bad, but undercooked and sometimes repetitive. Unique metaphors are one-hit wonders, if you pull them out again, we will notice (hair like ink on his brow, buttery sunlight). It does not read like fantasy prose and feels entirely too modern. That was a problem deeper than prose, but certainly evident in the writing style. I had the privilege of consuming this novel on audiobook, and without the narrator, many writing faults would be more evident. (Also, I don't know how to spell any of these names because I read it on audiobook. So sorry for that.)That being said, it is consumable. I could get through it. I feel like I had an okay sense of where the characters were spacially. I knew where they were mentally because the author would just tell us. It's a common vice in Young Adult. The blatant explanations of Isla's struggle in her internal monologue and the faux femininist ideology of this book that would've been standard in the early 2010s really highlighted Sarah J Maas' writing as inspiration. Which kind of sucks, because her prose isn't good either.Now onto the premise. There are six rulers of six different realms trying to break their curses by competing in a Centennial, a game that takes place on an island that only emerges every hundred years. Simple enough? No it isn't.Listen, I am a seasoned fantasy reader. More than that, I was a Supernatural fan in my heyday. I have made sense of many things that do not make sense.This book did not make sense.First and foremost, it's impossible to get a real grasp on stakes. These lands have been suffering with their curses for five hundred years. And some of the curses are gnarly! The wildling's curse is that they have to eat a human heart every month to survive. But then, the people here live to be very old? Which, presumably means that they don't have very many children. The population can't be that high, because it wouldn't be sustainable if people are living longer. So how do they have even a year's supply of hearts? It's explained to us that the wildlings are dying, that their realm is losing power, that they don't have enough hearts to sustain them, but it's so hard to have a good grasp on exactly what's going on because there are so many variables that are vaguely explained. Are they at half their power, a tenth? How big are they compared to other realms? How many people do they lose a year? We need to understand the stakes! Please!For example, both of the love interests in this thing are over 500 years old. Yet, the starling curse is that their people don't live past the age of 25. How- I can't even wrap my head around it. In a world where people are living centuries, you give them a quarter of one, and barely explain its repercussions. Every single person in that realm was raised by teenagers. They're all young parents or teen moms. Saying that's the curse and that obviously it sucks and that's why their numbers are dwindling is not good enough, because I cannot understand the stakes. I don't understand how this was sustainable for 500 years and it's not anymore. I don't understand the ways the world has changed in a way that has material impacts on the average person besides ""yeah they'll die early"". Some of this stuff was touched on, but not developed. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm reading it with other people who got the arc, and we're all missing something then.Okay, slight tangent, but it's clear that this world was not thought about at all. Because, naturally, I feel like there would be more inter-realm interaction if they were all weakened? The wildling realm could get their hearts from starlings who die early. Starling would not be much of a realm of its own, but instead be an orphaned diaspora at risk of fizzling out. Other realms would take advantage of their naivete and lack of mentorship. And so on and so forth.There was some bending over backwards to explain away magial heirs and create the stakes that if someone dies in the game, their realm dies. We don't find out until like 75% throughout the book that people begin to age when they have kids because of passing down magic and heirs and whatever. She mentions elders, but then what would an elder be? How old would they be? If someone can live to a thousand without having kids and still look like they're in their 20s, is that an elder? How long do people live after they have kids? I feel like naturally, that would disincentivize having kids which once again begs the question where tf are the wildlings getting their hearts? I read this book with someone who spent the majority of it convinced that [redacted] was Isla's father, which wouldn't have been possible if any of this was actually made clear. I also might have missed it, but maybe only the realm rulers live hella long. I doubt it though because it seems like everyone in this world connected to a realm has powers. The fact that I can't tell really just proves how convoluted the worldbuilding was. My confusion effectively killed the stakes for this book, and I could not find a foothold for the forthcoming tension. I could keep going for like five pages trying to talk about how the worldbuilding was thoughtless and an active detriment to the story. Also how it feels ACOTAResque. I did not want to live in the Lightlark world. I don't even want to visit. I don't have a good grasp on how much magic is in the world, how they lived so long with the curses, how many people live there, or even what it looks like. I was imagining traditional fantasy stuff until homegirl mentions a bra and then I was like hold the phone. Hairclips and scrunchies don't even exist in this world, and she's out here with a BRA?The main character, Isla, is insufferable, though I've read worse. Her entire thing is not having agency, but then she'll regularly let her emotions get the better of her and make the entire situation worse when she does make decisions. I did not care for her. I felt like a lot of internal character logic was warped for the sake of plot or love interest situations. Not a fan! It's somehow more frustrating than the miscommunication trope, and not in a good way! Small knit pick, but I hate how her name was pronounced Ice-lah. Like, if it's not gonna be pronounced like Isla, just spell it differently. Eisla. There. Fixed it!The love interests. I have nothing else to say other than Grim is Rhysand from ACOTAR and Oro is Prince Maxon from the Selection if he was OP and had hella magic. That perfectly encapsulates both how their written and the extent of their dynamics. It's so reminiscent of ~other stuff~ it's difficult to see them as their own established characters, especially Grim. They're both like 500 years old and have a rivalry.I don't know who finds the 500 year man and 18 year old girl romance appealing, but I'm so tired of it. It's laughable. Even if they look 20... seriously? Every time I remember the character's ages, and how they actually act in the book, I have to laugh. Even just the fact that she beats them both in combat. It's like... okay. Both of these men led their armies in a war against each other 500 years ago and have been practicing fighting since and they just got their asses beat by an 18 year old. She wasn't even doing anything new that they haven't seen or her puting her own spin on it. She just beat them. Funny. I know it's YA and the main character needs some quality that gives her worth like that, but it's just so jarring. Grim's dialogue is attrocious. I can't even tell if the other dialogue in the book is alright, or if it just looks fine next to whatever comes out of his mouth.Pacing of this thing was excruciating. It slows down a lot at the 30% mark, and doesn't pick up again until the 70% mark. Basically, the second act is a slog. Once you reach the midpoint, it feels like it should be the break into the third act, but it's not. A lot of this felt like filler. Aster could've combined scenes easily. The trials were boring to read, and felt like there were no real stakes or reasoning behind them. They were there to give structure to the book. I don't get why the centennial was pitched as a competitive game. All realms but one benefit from the curse being broken, so why would they all compete against each other so insularly? Realistically, yes, they would've competed but it would be more political intregue, alliances and whispering behind doors, and less of whatever this is... the Selection trying to be sold as the Hunger Games. Now, the plot twist. This thing has been teased up and down. The plot twist! The plot twist! Does the plot twist make sense? Tecnically, after like 10 minutes of explanation, yeah. Is it good? ... No. I thought the plot twist would make us re-examine a lot of the relationships that the entire book spent cultivating. It would add new insight. It did play with our perception, but it felt really out of left field. A good plot twist adds nuance. This. This was not that. This book was so entrenched deeply in plot and love interests that it lost track of like... theme. And now the things that happen in the plot are meant to inform theme. How the plot twist should reflect on theme. Maybe I'm the dumb one here, but I just thought the twist was cheap.In the hands of a more competent author, this could've been an intriguing high fantasy. Maybe it could've been written in multiple POVs and really intereacted with its characters as rulers of dying kingdoms, and the character motivations that go along with it. I want to see what Cleo's secret was! I wanted to see how Azul faced his fears! I wanted to see how the world's consequences and the rulers' motivations interacted and intersected and led to unlikely alliances and power plays. Or, at the very least I wanted to see some cool action scenes. Even within the context of what it is, as a female-led YA book, I would've wanted... something new. Something different. Something other than another sheltered girl who's really good at fighting and falling in love. Lean into the fantasy, lean into what makes this book different. Because it just feels the same. At least define the atmosphere to be unique or noteworthy, because for all that convoluted worldbuilding, nothing feels new.MINOR SPOILERS//I saved this paragraph for last because it has to do with the plot twist, so if you're avoiding spoilers, look away. I won't say exactly what the twist was, but I will say by the end of it, there are no morally good female characters in the book besides the MC and a servant girl who gets two lines. And when I say not morally good, I mean they're like straight up evil. Backstabbing betrayal. Any betrayal or misstep by a man is handled with miles more nuance and forgiveness than anything a woman does in this book. The women's motivations are cartoonishly handled, and in the end, the ones responsible for the MC's plight. Very, very boring. Very tiring. Their decisions don't even foil the MC. It doesn't inform theme. It's. I don't know. It's just... in 2022? Really? We're doing this? I'm gonna have to add more stipulations to the Bechdel test because come on.I don't want to write a conclusion, so I won't. Thanks for the arc. My curiosity has been quenched. Tiktok will love this book. I can't imagine that it's translation to film will be good. I say that as a film reviewer who doubles as an avid reader. Things aren't looking good.EDIT 8/15/2022Dropping it to one star for visibility and also because I thought more about the plot twist and realized none of the actual actions lined up with the convoluted motivations.Also, for people who are critical of Aster as an industry plant, I highly suggest you read more about her sister, Daniella Pierson, and how she made a creative agency focusing on tiktok marketing called Newsland along with her newsletter. Industry plants do not exist in publishing, but money and connections do lend privilege, which is nothing new. This kind of success has happened before. Ernest Cline had a movie deal for Ready Player One before the book was out. Then again, both RPO and Lightlark are highly commercialized novels, which I do consider an issue when regarding the industry as a whole and what becomes popular.I recommend Ursula Le Guin’s essay titled “A Matter of Trust” from the Wave in the Mind if you are a young writer aspiring to become better at the craft and feel tempted by the appeal of quick commercial success. I’ll put it in front of every tiktok and twitter author if I have to lol. Eat your vegetables (serious, challenging novels that challenge you to think). Reading for entertainment is fine, but your writing will become so much better if you understand what makes great books great in a deeper sense, which necessitates a balanced diet. Trope marketing also plays into the increasing commercialization of novels, which Aster has utilized heavily, despite many of her tiktoks being misleading. False advertisement is not good marketing, which is why we’re now seeing a backlash. But also writing a highly commercial book is not a good book, because tropes are tools and not substance. Sell substance to readers. Anyways it’s very clear to me that Aster cares about writing and storytelling, but perhaps not as much the art or craft of it. To quote Billy Joel, slow down you crazy child, you’re so ambitious for a juvenile.I am unfortunately a bit of an aspiring writer myself (derogatory) and do not find my work to be anything good, or special. But making peace with this inspires me to be better, to work harder. I can take it, and I’m sure Aster can too. I have no doubt that Aster has worked hard, but her insistence on publishing this book even after her first agent dropped her for it and her claim that she does not suffer from imposter’s syndrome despite her massive premature success does lead me to believe that her writing is stunted from a lack of introspection. That isn’t to say she shouldn’t be proud of her work or achievements, but this entire mess is just reflective of an author who got way ahead of herself. Books are not as good as their marketing, their tropes, or anything else of that sort. They’re as good as the author makes it. Brandon Sanderson said (roughly from his BYU lectures), don’t focus on writing a good book, but becoming the kind of author capable of writing a good book. Which is what Aster has been working on, but if Lightlark is any reflection of her progress, she has a ways to go.",1.0

A me sinceramente interessa poco di quanto le sue accanitissime lettrici cerchino di farla passare come una causalità, è talmente palese che mi sembra ridicolo negare l’evidenza. Il tutto è reso ancora più divertente dalle azioni persecutrici di Erin Doom nei confronti di chi OSA criticare questo ammasso di paroloni buttati insieme e dal suo passato (di cui sono tristemente a conoscenza) fatto di intimidazioni e minacce legali (perché ricordo che è laureata in giurisprudenza) rivolte a chi su Wattpad osava avere qualche elemento vagamente simile ai suoi nella propria storia. Imbarazzante. Velo pietoso. ————————————————————————edit #1: rating cambiato da tre stelle a una.1⭐️Questo libro é la prova palese di come le autrici italiane debbano ricevere un ordine restrittivo nei confronti del bully romance. Se non lo sapete scrivere, non scrivetelo. TW: menzione di abusi fisici e sessuali Non è il primo libro che leggo dell’autrice, e anzi ho addirittura seguito gli aggiornamenti capitolo per capitolo da quando su Wattpad esisteva solo la trama. La conclusione? Il libro che meritava di uscire in libreria era decisamente il primo, non questo. Questo, sembra un ammasso di scene discutibili scritte in modo troppo arzigogolato che punta a essere un retelling di cappuccetto rosso e che fallisce malamente. L’altro era un bel libro, per gli standard di Wattpad. Andiamo per ordine. I protagonisti:Abbiamo Nica, la classica santarellina amante di flora e fauna che giustifica il suo essere una totale inetta con il suo passato da bambina abusata in orfanotrofio. Se vi sembra che la mia descrizione sia insensibile é perché insensibile é il modo in cui questo libro mi ha fatto sentire. Gli abusi sui bambini vengono trattati frettolosamente, sono molto confusi e sembrano semplicemente un modo per dare una parvenza di sfondo alle personalità dei due protagonisti. (Ovviamente sono grumpy boy/sunshine girl, se non si fosse capito). Seguire il punto di vista di Nica é stato snervante perché si tratta di una bambina di cinque anni nel corpo di una diciassettenne. I suoi unici interessi sono i cerotti che ha alle dita, gli insetti nel giardino di casa e gli occhi neri del fratellastro.Poi abbiamo Rigel, un mezzo stalker ossessionato che grazie a due note sul pianoforte riesce a farsi adottare con Nica. Questo ragazzo si può descrivere semplicemente come uno psicopatico. Non c’é un altro modo per parlarne perché il suo unico pensiero é la protagonista e per il resto la sua testa é vuota. Il suo unico tratto distintivo é saper suonare il pianoforte e essere bono come la luna le stelle e il firmamento, ah e giustificare la sua psicosi con una malattia rarissima al cervello. Se questa follia vi suona famigliare é perché l’abbiamo ritrovata in “The Villain” della Shen, con Cillian che teneva a bada le emozioni per tenere a bada la tourette. (Evidentemente é una cosa che tra le scrittrici di NA va di moda? Non saprei.) I personaggi secondari: Sono in tutto sette. In ordine abbiamo, i genitori adottivi (inutili), due saffiche (inutili), la bitch della scuola (inutile), il terzo lato del triangolo che si rivela un abuser (inutile, perché ancora una volta gli abusi vengono usati come escamotage per mandare avanti il romance), l’amica dell’orfanotrofio che fa diventare il triangolo un quadrato (inutile ma accettabile, perché é l’unico personaggio che in questo libro si sopporta.) - Sui genitori non ho molto da dire, sono pressoché assenti e quando ci sono servono a fare battute tristi e a cucinare o vendere fiori. - La bitch della scuola, di cui ho totalmente rimosso il nome, c’è per due capitoli e serve a far suonare nella testa di Nica i campanelli d’allarme della gelosia. - Le uniche due amiche che Nica si fa sono due saffiche la cui storia viene buttata in mezzo al libro per circa due capitoli buoni e poi abbandonata. Una é innamorata ma non ha fatto coming out e l’altra non ha capito niente; purtroppo questa pseudo inclusivitá fa da contorno del contorno. Il tutto si risolve in pochissimi capitoli con nessun tipo di sensibilità sull’argomento. - L’amica dell’orfanotrofio, Adeline, è l’unico personaggio sopportabile. Il suo unico scopo é mettere un po’ di zizzania facendoci credere che sarà un problema tra i protagonisti ma per il resto é innocua. Oltre a questo serve a mandare minimamente avanti la trama rivelando finalmente che qualcuno dei bambini in orfanotrofio ha cantato sugli abusi. - Il ragazzo che prova ad abusare di Nica si chiama Leonard (o Leopold?), e devo dire che per quanto l’autrice abbia provato a farcelo detestare non é tanto peggio di Rigel. Anche lui la pedina, anche lui le fa cose che lei non ha chiesto. (vedi: il protagonista che le entra in camera e le fa dei succhiotti mentre dorme. é normale? no. mi interessa che sia il protagonista? NO.) L’ambientazione: É inutile. Questo libro é ambientato in Michigan ma la storia potrebbe anche svolgersi in pianura padana per la qualità delle descrizioni. Sappiamo che c’è un fiume (quale? boh), due case, una scuola e un ponte da cui i protagonisti cadono, FINE. Il che mi ha stupito, perché nel libro che Matilde (l’autrice usa uno pseudonimo) ha scritto prima, le descrizioni del Canada erano non male, seppur prolisse come al suo solito.Tra l’altro sembra una storia completamente fuori dal mondo. I personaggi si comportano come sociopatici e pur avendo due genitori adottivi che lavorano stabilmente ricevono come telefoni dei modelli con I TASTI? Evidentemente non bastavano le lucertole ma servivano i telefoni del paleolitico per far sembrare Nica ancora più piccola fiammiferaia. Niente sembra realistico, partendo dai pensieri dei protagonisti, passando alle ambientazioni, al modo in cui tutti i personaggi dialogano. (I dialoghi sono la parte peggiore, ma in generale lo stile di scrittura é cosí artificioso che viene da pensare che l’autrice si sia mangiata un libro di poesie discutibili e le abbia vomitate in prosa.) In generale? Questo libro non ha né capo né coda e mi viene da supporre che sia finita così perché l’autrice aveva un po’ troppe pretese che si sono risolte male. La trama é sconnessa e vuota fino agli ultimi capitoli (anche questi discutibili) il libro in sé voleva essere un po’ vago e misterioso, un po’ un bully romance in stile Penelope Douglas e un po’ rifarsi alle favole.SPOILER Il risultato é un mattone infinito senza una storia portante (ma prima di pubblicarlo lo ha letto un editor?) che si compone di episodi sconnessi e discutibili quali: il protagonista che la bullizza ammazzandole delle farfalle davanti e tirandole i codini a sette anni, il protagonista che picchia chi le parla, il protagonista che le fa i succhiotti mentre lei é ignara, il protagonista che le sussurra all’orecchio al buio da dietro, loro che entrano in bagno quando l’altro si sta facendo la doccia, loro che cadono da un burrone insieme e lui che sconfigge il coma (pur avendo una malattia cerebrale rarissima) perché lei andava lí a leggergli le favole. Il tutto condito con questi accenni agli abusi che i bambini ricevevano in orfanotrofio e che servono a questa storia come la maionese nell’insalata di riso. Onestamente rivorrei davvero il tempo che ci ho sprecato indietro.",1.0

""In the end, the monster we feared didn’t come from Hell. He came from privilege.""

Oh, this review is going to be a wild ride. The range of things I feel for this book is very unreal. Listen, the atmosphere of this? The settings? The premise? I couldn’t get enough. Dare I even say close to perfect? And the plot had me so very invested in every single way. But this actual story and the plot conveniences, the characters and their lack of critical thinking, the obvious plot twists? The Lord might be testing me. The whiplash I felt while reading this was a full experience and deserves a star rating of its own, truly.When you open this book for the first time, the prologue will transport you to a stormy night in 19th century Italy, where two little twin girls are being gifted very special necklaces while slowly learning their witch powers and history from their grandmother. There are seven demon princes but only 4 the witches should fear, but somehow their necklaces will keep them safe, even though they are instructed to never place them together.

""One will crave your blood. One will capture your heart. One will steal your soul. And one will take your life.""

Then the story actually takes place ten years in the future, where Emilia and Vittoria are now eighteen-years-old, but we see how that night has shaped their lives for the last decade in so many different ways, but for sure centering on those necklaces that were entrusted to them. Both girls are trying to help their family with their restaurant, find and follow their dreams, and lead normal lives, but they soon find out that normal and safe and happy was never in the cards for them.Again, I do not want to give much away, because I think I very much benefited from not reading the synopsis of this story. But the gates of hell are weakening, and their city and family are no longer safe. Not only do they have to worry about hiding the fact that they are witches, but now they have to worry about demon princes, witch hunters, and other creatures that go bump in the night! But Emilia is thrust in the heart of it all, with her witchcraft on full display, when she makes a deal with a demon when she is most desperate.Together, Emilia and Wrath (be still, my BDB heart) are forced to work together to investigate brutal and mysterious murders that are happening, but they are both looking for clues for very different reasons. My favorite part of this book was truly going alongside Emilia and seeing all these different settings. From secret casinos, to her family’s kitchen, surprise palaces, spooky beaches, to the scary and dark corridors within the church, I couldn’t get enough of all the different adventures in all the different places.

""Grief carved me in half. And fury honed the pieces into a weapon.""

I really loved the depiction of grief and depression in this book, too. How the weight of sadness can be unbearable, especially alone, when your world and future are taken from you right before your eyes. I also think Kerri Maniscalco did a really good job portraying not only the different stages that can be held within grief, but to also tell the reader that there is truly no wrong way to grieve. Heartbreak can be sadness and pain, but it can also be anger and revenge.I also did really enjoy the romance and I think if you are looking to indulge in a new OTP that will remind you of 2015 then you are in luck with this one! I did enjoy Wrath a lot more than Emilia for the most part, but I feel like the plot convenience (and Emilia acting stupid) was the downfall of this book. I am not good at unraveling mysteries, but I truly unraveled this one instantly, I only wish Emilia could have a little sooner and it made the reading experience a bit annoying. Also, she gets upset at the strangest things, and wholeheartedly accepts the wildest things for no reason. I truly feel like her character was mostly used to move the book along conveniently instead of actually making her feel like a main character with depth and identity.Also, I’m just going to say it, the grandmother in this book is one of the most infuriating characters I’ve read about all 2020. Like, regardless of prophecies, how are you going to be this mysterious with eight-year-old little girls and then really not fill them in on any blanks for the next ten years of their lives too? The grandma is really written to look like this cool and wise character who helps save the day, but I truly could not stand her or her shocked reaction when things would fall apart around her.On top of the mysteries in this book being a bit of a letdown, I will also say that I felt like so many big events in this book kind of happened just for (hopefully) set ups for the next installment. I’m all for setting up things in early books, but it just kind of feels bad when absolutely nothing happens regarding these big chapters after the scene has ended. I feel like if this book felt more cohesive throughout, instead of just setting up for what is to come, I would have gotten so much of a higher rating from me, but I have to rate and review off the material that is given to me and it made for a bit of an infuriating reading experience.

""Man had a funny way of blaming the devil for things he didn’t like.""

Overall, I couldn’t put this book down. Truly. And I would bet you a great sum of money that I will also pick up the next one, because this book ended on a very perfect cliffhanger set up that I greedily want to know everything about. This book really did give me nostalgic feels for some reason, it made me very hungry most of the time, and it made me truly never want to put it down. The writing is so easily consumable, and I really did fall in love with the setting and plot set up. I only wish it felt a little bit more like a full story and not just a set up book. I still predict that this book will do really well, and I think most people will have a very good reading experience with this with.Trigger and Content Warnings: gore, violence, blood depiction, self-harm to get blood for spells, loss of a loved one, grief depiction, murder, death, brief mention of unwanted touching, and magical compulsion.Blog | Instagram | Youtube | Ko-fi | Spotify | Twitch Buddy read with Maëlys & Lea! ❤",3.0

158,The Grace Year,,4.15,"['October', '8,', '2019']","""I have to remind myself -the dresses, the red ribbons, the veils, the ceremonies- they're all just distractions to keep our minds off the real issue at hand. The grace year. My chin begins to quiver when I think of the year ahead, the unknown, but I plaster on a vacant smile, as if I'm happy to play my part, so I might return and marry and breed and die. But not all of us will make it home...not in one piece.""Hello, good evening, and let me introduce you to my favorite book of 2019, The Grace Year. I know it sounds ridiculous to be picking a favorite book when half of the year hasn't even passed us by, but that's how sure I am that nothing else will even come close to measuring against what this book did to me-how it made me feel-and for how it will affect my thoughts and behavior long term. This book was horrifying and beautiful, weighty yet buoyant, and I will never be the same again after experiencing what was written in these pages. I finished the story last night, but I couldn't shake what I'd read, even in my dreaming state, and I don't think I'll be able to get a good night's sleep again until I work through this review, so here goes nothing.""As the gate closes on the guards troubled faces, it's clear they truly believe we're loathsome creatures that need to be hidden away for safekeeping, for our own good, to exorcise the demons lurking inside of us, but even in this cursed place, anger, fear, and resentment boiling inside of me, I still don't feel magical. I still don't feel powerful. I feel forsaken.""While the county that The Grace Year takes place in is a dystopian type setting, it is certainly brought to life in a way that makes it feel real. If you've read the synopsis to this book, then you know the basic gist of the story, and the early readers stating that this has The Handmaid's Tale meets Lord of the Flies vibes are spot on. The entire story is written to the extreme, and yet every moment, down to the most minute detail, is an allegory for experiences that most (dare I say all?) females have encountered at some point and time by their sixteenth birthday. The writing is atmospheric, breathtakingly beautiful, and evokes the most basic and raw emotion from the reader. Perhaps I had too many preconceived notions going in, but I was also surprised by quite a few of the little twists and turns that Liggett throws at us, and I utterly adore that she did not cut any corners or take any easy outs with this story. There are some really hard, horrifying, things that happen in this book, and even to the very last page, no one is guaranteed a happily ever after, and yet I've never felt more hopeful, secure, and proud to be a woman as I was when I turned the final page of The Grace Year. I know I haven't given much in terms of plot detail, but I truly believe each and every reader should go into this one with an open mind, and open heart, and a need for compulsive page turning, because that's exactly what this book will provide. I cannot recommend this story highly enough and there aren't enough stars on the entirety of Goodreads to express how emphatically I want you to add this book to your TBR. In some ways, I think females will appreciate this book the most, solely for the feminist thematic elements and encouragement, but I also believe that many men would enjoy and benefit from reading this book as well. Beyond the priceless message it provides, The Grace Year is a highly entertaining read that I wish had been around when I was a teenager. The ending provides the type of female camaraderie that I wished for my predecessors, hope to see for myself and my generation, and feel arising in both of my daughters' generation. Well done, and I cannot wait for this story to be out in the world so that everyone else can read it and discuss. ""The things we do to girls. Whether we put them on pedestals only to tear them down, or use them for parts and holes, we're all complicit in this. But everything touches everything else and I have to believe that some good will come out of all this destruction. The men will never end the grace year. But maybe we can.""*Uncorrected Bound Manuscript provided via the publisher.",5.0
159,A Deadly Education,,3.97,"['September', '29,', '2020']","⇓ Edited to Add: On the Controversy ⇓
Since its release, this book has been accused of racism. I respect those who have been hurt and am sorry for their pain, but I want to say that—as a Middle Eastern who has also strived to be as aware of racism as possible—I personally did not find this book racist. Most of the accusations I’ve read have seemed insubstantial to me—if you view words out of context with the aim of finding something offensive, of course you will succeed.The school giving El content showing death and violence, urging her to become a mass murderer, happens for all nations as a result of her dark affinity and not just an Arabic speaking country. The issue of how languages/cultures are viewed cynically by the MC (e.g. characters being called “the Arabic speaker”) is not a sign of the author’s thoughtlessness but the truth of how El—who is deeply antisocial due to the abuse she’s faced from everyone (not just some of the Indian side of her biracial family)—sees life, with people as only assets in her eyes. This does not mean Novik endorses these views; she proves her thoughtfulness by proceeding to thoroughly tackle themes of injustice and privilege.However, there is a harmful comment on dreadlocks for which Novik immediately apologised (source) admitting her mistake in adding the passage very late and after the sensitivity read, and that she’d meant to write only “locs.” It makes sense that El would, again, cynically analyse the practicality of various elaborate hairstyles in this deadly school; the problem was how dreadlocks were singled out, and Novik humbly apologised, promising to fix it and detailing how she would do better in the future.So yes I love this book and author, not least because that was one of the best and most genuine apologies I’ve read. Isn’t raising awareness the ultimate goal? What can we possibly achieve by shutting down people after one mistake?I also urge you to read the words of THIS CHINESE REVIEWER before marching into battle.

⇓ Actual Review ⇓
If 
Hogwarts
 was a prickly, sentient, professorless school infested with demons, and the lead was an angry, dark 
Queen of Sarcasm
 and prophesied harbinger of death, trying to study and survive...or die, you’d have this book.Do I have your attention yet?
You have to ration sympathy and grief in here the way you ration your school supplies.
Naomi Novik’s new series The Scholomance is, obviously, inspired by the folkloric Scholomance, a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania run by the devil.There are apparent differences, of course; in that no one runs this school except for magic, and that this deadly version of the academy is the closest young witches and wizards can come to a protected and safe environment during their vulnerable teen years, as they happen to live in a world where their magic-filled bodies are to the monsters what marshmallow crunch brownie bars dripping with chocolate are to yours truly:That is, y u m m y.
Nobody gets to live or not live because they deserve it, deserving doesn’t count for a thing.
With an awesome unlikeable MC (just my type), LOL-producing writing, mouthwatering world-building, YA highschool-ish vibe, and chilling, gag-inducing creatures roaming the hallways, bathrooms, and all the nooks and crannies of the insubstantial and magical structure of the place (one of which nearly gave me—Queen of Being Unperturbed By Dreams and Thrilled By What Most Consider Nightmares—nightmares) this could’ve easily been an entertaining five star read, if not for the info dumps.I enjoy info dumps. I really do. I even binge-read Wikipedia in my free time. But there is something called “this is not the place dammit I’m excited for something else move aside,” m’dear.
It’s too easy to call people evil instead of their choices, and that lets people justify making evil choices, because they convince themselves that it’s okay because they’re still good people overall, inside their own heads.
I’ll just continue to appreciate the tackling of struggles rising from mixed ethnicity and not fitting anywhere, applaud the diversity that extends to even food, fall in love with the dominant theme of inequality and privilege so thoroughly explored, make puppy eyes the attention to science and technicalities, and be absorbed by the focus on carefully and creatively crafted lessons and study strategies, all while listening to my book playlist on repeat (which you can find at the end of the review) and waiting for the sequel.
⇓ Storyline ⇓
(Most) all memorable heroes have a prophecy. Well, so does El. It just so happens that hers isn’t a prophecy of saving the world blah blah, it’s one of death and destruction. Charming, right?Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, no one else thinks so.Thus our snarky little main character will have to navigate school without allies, the consequence of which would not be a lonely, dejected life, but rather death at graduation when she will have to pass through a hall of monsters to get out of the damned place without anyone watching her back.She intends to avoid that, of course, which means this dark witch needs to focus on smooth talking the politics and sitting arrangements of school life and establishing herself as a powerful addition to any interested group (much like peacocks tidying their feathers and attracting mates, one might say), while at the same time studying and surviving and making sure she doesn’t slaughter thousands to do so. Easy peasy.So I believe you realise how annoying it is for a shining hero by the name of Orion Lake to swoop in, repeatedly, and turn her into a damsel in distress.
Selfish of me, you’ll say, to be contemplating with murderous intent the hero responsible for the continued survival of a quarter of our class. Well, too bad for the losers who couldn’t stay afloat without his help. We’re not meant to all survive, anyway. The school has to be fed somehow.

⇓ Storytelling ⇓

I didn’t want to actually become a maleficer and then go bursting out of this place like some monstrous butterfly hatching from a gigantic chrysalis of doom to lay waste and sow sorrow across the world as per the prophecy.
A Deadly Education is my first book by Naomi Novik but can I just say that I stan her style??Witty, humourous, and sprinkled with exactly the right amount of absurdity in her genius similes and metaphors, Novik has immediately established her herself as a new fave author of mine with her technique. I’m telling you, even the (admittedly too frequent and unflattering) info dumps were done with such a unique touch that I’m simply impressed! The banter. The hilarious moments brewed and executed so aptly. Ahhh.
“I know you’re just waiting for us to put your statue up, but that’s no reason to carry on like a slab of solid rock.”
The best part of the storytelling was, however, the way the author somehow threw thriller and humour in the same pot and unbelievably got a delicious unputdownable stew out of it. I mean, we would encounter a petrifying monster that had me on the verge of screaming and we are about to die and yet Naomi proceeds to kindly point you toward more books for further information. Like, WHAT. My expression was something between 😱 and 😂; upon messing around with the emojis, this is the closest I’ve gotten: 
⇓ Characters ⇓

◈ Galadriel aka El:
Meet the protagonist; a powerful witch with an affinity for dark magic so deadly even minor spells can turn into catastrophes—lonely, angry, bitter, sarcastic, smart, creative, natural with incantations, and shunned by anyone and everyone. And, whadayaknow, I was never ever annoyed by her snappish ungrateful behaviour because she’s just pure tragedy and has every right to be as she is—I even urged her on if I’m being honest, and yes you now may go ahead and call me crazy yay.
“You feel like it’s going to rain.”“What?”But Aadhya was already waving her hands around and elaborating. “You know that feeling when you’re a mile away from anywhere, and you didn’t take your umbrella because it was sunny when you left, and you’re in your good suede boots, and suddenly it gets dark and you can tell it’s about to start pouring buckets, and you’re like Oh great.” She nodded to herself, satisfied with her brilliant analogy. “That’s what it feels like, whenever you show up.”
It’s painful to be judged before you’ve had a chance. And El, my baby, has always had the worst assumed about her because of her power and the wrongness it projects to others—even as an innocent child. And tired and full of hate, she becomes the angry bitter person everyone now rightly avoids. I understood how she wanted to be wanted for herself and didn’t care for being wanted by the many self-serving people around her. I shared her emotions and bitterness at what kept happening to her. But more than anything else, I loved her acknowledgement of her anger issues. So yes, I spent the entire book chanting go dark go dark kill them all, praying she’d end up going down the terrifying sorceress path prophecised for her. And yes, I am still praying.⤷ I see her as Disney’s Megara ⤵

◈ Orion Lake:
Meet the love interest; initially annoying, generally unbelievable and bewildering, messy, clueless, also lonely bulldozer of a hero who is such a hero that, at some points, it stops being annoying (to me, I mean, the evil soul who can’t stand these Gryffinpuffs) and starts being hilarious and even adorable. How I ended up loving this privileged, sheltered boy acting all gloriously good and gracious, going around killing monsters as if they are the real baddies of this unjust world...is anyone’s guess. It might have to do with how much of a sweet and non-toxic boy he is.⤷ To me, he’s a total Hercules ⤵

◈ Everyone Else:
I think I need to stop rambling before you guys come hunt me down and kill me in the most gruesome ways you can imagine for writing and writing and writing and WRITING nonstop like a typing machine gone rouge. I’ll only say the rest were fleshed out as well and even our Mean Girl was More Than Just A Mean Girl.
⇓ Relationships ⇓
The dynamic of Gal (protagonist) and Orion (love interest) is practically Megara and Hercules from Disney’s 1997 animation. In short:



So thank you, Naomi Novik, for giving me a new cute, crazy, quietly-brewing, enemies-to-reluctant-allies-to-not-yet-lovers, promising 
romance
 with such a hilarious bond that jumps right out of the page, grabbing me by the throat with its grasping hands made of iconic banter and scenes. And thank you, for the beautifully written journey of discovering what loyalty, understanding, and acceptance in friendship feel like—especially female ones.See? I can keep it short, too. #yayme
⇓ Worldbuilding ⇓
This world. THIS WORLD. What can I say to encompass the massive amount of awe-inspiring info delivered in these 300+ pages? A world with magic-eating monsters where the privileged live in protected enclaves and the rest of the rabble fend for themselves and, inevitably, die. A moody school in the place between nowhere and everywhere that relies on belief to stay upright, so dangerous you have to check every step lest a nightmare jump out from beneath the table and eat you alive. And pure madness.You’re probably wondering: How in the world would an academy with no adults and teachers actually function? Why would students be crammed into a building, all as perfect bait for the hungry demons? And trust me, dear Naomi has thought of every criticism and argument and counter-argument (like someone y’all know *winky wink*), and discussed them to make impossible “I’m possible.”To be honest, I’ve never been especially fond of the teacher-student dynamic as to me it’s unnecessary in most cases—I understand that many need someone to explain what they read to them but, for me, there’s nothing I can’t learn through reading a book or being observant and practicing; in fact, I prefer not to have some teacher keep irritating me and telling me what to do. That’s why I found the professorless school Naomi Novik has come up with to be extremely relatable and rather refreshing when every “magic school” book centres around it. In Scholomance, you either study independently or with your friends’ help, or you die.Fascinating and insane, that’s the only way to put it.An Scholomance-library-sized thanks to my superhero for sending me an eARC from Edelweiss!

In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
163,Catching Fire,Sparks are igniting.Flames are spreading.And the Capitol wants revenge.,4.33,"['September', '1,', '2009']","I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music. And everybody in the theater laughs, and then the film cuts to Hitler laughing, watching a movie of a Nazi soldier killing Americans. It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil. There was a moment when I first saw Merchant of Venice that was like that, and I was depressed for a month after I read Notes from the Underground because of the same type of experience. I don’t know where you get that brand of story-telling ability, but Suzanne Collins has it coming out of her ears, in the sort of young adult variety. Catching Fire was maybe not as striking as the first book in this series, The Hunger Games, in making me disturbed about myself, but it definitely had its moments. Also, I was in my second week of law school and had just gotten back from an exhausting wedding when I read it, so I might not have had the capacity to self-reflect that I normally do. If you don’t know already, even though you should know, the premise of this series is a that in the future, post-apocalyptic world of the super-badass Katniss Everdeen, one rich city controls twelve poor-to-starving cities that produce all of the goods for the rich city. In order to keep the poor cities in fear, the rich city requires each of the poor cities to send one teenage boy and one teenage girl as tributes to play the Hunger Games. In the Hunger Games the kids have to kill each other until there is one survivor, who gets to party for the rest of his/her life but never really feels like partying because everything’s so fucked up. Usually they go crazy, if they didn’t start out that way. It’s very Lord of the Flies, and yes it is the same premise as Battle Royale, but not as determinedly nasty as those two books. Also, girl action hero! Anyway, a couple of days after I finished this book, I was spacing off instead of briefing cases, and I started thinking about the description of the capital city that controls the other cities. There is a part where Katniss and another character have to go to a party at the capital, and there are as many amazing foods as they can imagine. It’s a big party, and they’re celebrities, and everyone loves them. They have one bite of every kind of food, so that they can taste everything, but unfortunately they get full. One of their entourage explains to them that there are puke closets, so that everyone can keep eating for the whole night, and our two characters suddenly step back from the party and remember their families and neighbors, who are starving while the capital lives in decadence. I was thinking about that and how the shallow people in the capital city were just as culpable for the evil in their society as the military that imposed starvation on the cities, and then, suddenly, I realized, duh, she’s talking about me. This story is really about the global economy, and (passive, consumption-driven U.S. citizen that I am) I’m not the hero. So, that’s about three times this month that I’ve been on the side of terrorists. I don’t know whether that means story-tellers are gettin’ pretty tricky, or if it just means I think there’s a problem with the way stuff is. Or that, like, I’m becoming a rager, or something. (FBI, if you’re reading this, JK about this whole paragraph. LOL!)When I was working my 8-5 job last year, I started listening to some iTunesU classes while I was doing my work so that my brain wouldn’t die. One of them was given by Carolyn Marvin at Stanford, and it was called “True Colors: Myth, Magic, and the American Flag.” The premise, to summarize very briefly, was that for any culture to stay together, the culture requires a blood sacrifice. This article goes into more detail about nationalism and blood sacrifice. She really convincingly pointed out how, civilized though we think we are, blood sacrifice in modern Western culture is not really significantly different than tribal human sacrifices. It’s a seriously creepy theory, but I’m not kidding when I say that she’s right. Really, listen to the lecture. So, I’ve spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks doing a mental compare/contrast of the U.S. with this futuristic dystopia. We don’t come off looking too good, guys. Obviously these are really complicated topics, but nothing seems as simple as “violence is not the answer” or, on the other side of the argument, “destroy civilization.” I’m not positive what the right answer is, but I’d like to find out. I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem. How do we effectively refuse to benefit from universally destructive and dehumanizing trade practices, but still live healthy and productive lives?So, go read everything Suzanne Collins ever wrote (including the episodes of Clarissa Explains It All because that show is awesome) and reflect on international trade and the global economy. I don’t know if you’ll be a better person for it, but I think so. Maybe after you do all that reading you can help me figure out some way for us not to be Evil.",5.0
164,Mockingjay,My name is Katniss Everdeen.Why am I not dead?I should be dead.,4.09,"['August', '24,', '2010']","SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one! She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray). The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that ""this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!"" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions. That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: ""I must be the Mockingjay"", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the ""normal, average teen"" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like ""Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that."" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of ""realism"" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this ""Diary of an Emo Puppet."" This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title ""girl who was on fire"" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say ""Enough is enough."" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old. I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book). Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and ""give up on mankind""? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:""Because,"" said Harry, ""sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety!

165,The Fault in Our Stars,,4.14,"['January', '10,', '2012']","EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.You will cry, because this is VERY sad.So a discussion occurred in my head after I rated the book. A voice in my head: Come on. You can't post that on Goodreads. Me: *glares* Why not? A voice in my head (aka VH): Please, don't. You will ruin your reputation. Me: *weary* Not that again. VH: Well, it's true. You can't post that. It's just not okay. Do you have any idea how popular this book is? Hint : YOU CAN'T EVEN GUESS.Me: Why should I care? Maybe some people think like me.VH: You don't understand. It's not just random book that you can critize like you do all the time and just get away with it. This is THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. And it's John Green. Believe me, you do NOT want to get in the way of those crazy fans, nerdfighters or whatever it is they call themselves. Me: Really, what the fuck do I care? I want to give this 3 stars. It's not like I'm giving it 1 star or something. VH: But why would you even do that in the first place? EVERYONE, and I do mean EVERYONE in your friend list gave it 5 stars. And they used so many sobbing gifs! Really, it made me cry a little just looking at them. Me: *stares*VH: It won the Goodreads award for best YA!Me: So? Fifty Shades won Best Romance. VH: It's got one of the highest general ratings for a book on Goodreads!Me: Nobody but the Goodreads community actually cares. And wait. I'm not even sure the Goodreads community actually cares. I know I don't.VH: You're such a cold-hearted bitch. Why would you give it only 3 stars anyway? Don't you have a heart? And why 3 stars? I know you really loved the book, deep down! Me: I didn't. I mean, I liked it, it was okay... but I didn't love it. It's... I mean... Oh, fuck it. It's overrated. There! I said it. Sue me. VH: *seethes* You did NOT just say that. Me : I did. Because it is! Come on, did you read the dialogues in this? Can we talk about the dialogues? I want to talk about the dialogues.VH: *crosses arms* Go ahead. I want examples.Me: Fine. I'll start with the popular quotes. You know what I'm talking about. The quotes which are totally overrated and everyone loves them and they create pics and stuff when really, if you think about the quote in itself.. Well, you realize that it just, you know, sucks. VH: *mumbles* How 'bout: you suck?Me: What was that? Actually, forget it, I don't give a shit. Listen to this! “My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.”
VH: So? It's beautiful.Me: Well...*tries really hard to refrain from laughing* I mean... Seriously? Like... *fails miserably* HAHAHAHA how more pretentious can you get? Comparing your thoughts to stars? REALLY?VH: You're so shallow. Some of us have deep thoughts, you know. Like, thoughts so deep they actually deserve to be compared to the firmament. I don't even want to explain to you how poetic this is, because I'd waste my time. Me: Save yourself the effort, I don't mind. And I've got another example. Probably my favorite.""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.""
VH: What now? You're gonna say that it's so pretentious it made you cry?Me: Precisely. *nods wisely* Because that's the thing about tears. They demand to be wet. Or that's the thing about food. It demands to be eaten. Or that's the thing about...VH: SHUT UP, I get it! There's no discussion with you. How am I supposed to discuss with someone who's got the intellectual depth of an empty oyster?Me: But come on, I'm not finished yet. What about Augustus and his unlit cigarette?“They don’t kill you unless you light them,” he said. “And I’ve never lit one. It’s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing.”
Me: Is this supposed to be smart? This is pathetic. It's terrible, it's not funny, and it's not deep. VH: *hisses* It's a metaphor!Me: I know!“It’s a metaphor,” I said, dubious. “It’s a metaphor,” he said.“You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances...” I said.“Oh, yes.” He smiled. “I’m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.”
Me: Can you say metaphor again? Say metaphor one more time! Go ahead, say it, I think John Green hasn't totally forced it down my throat yet! *hysterical yelling* LET'S SAY IT AGAIN! Metaphor! Everything is a METAPHOR!VH: What's your point, you freak?Me: My point is, the dialogues are horrible. It made my eyes burn. It's pretentious and unbelievable, AND besides, you can totally see that John Green loves the characters.VH: What author doesn't like the characters of their own book?Me: It's not the same! With John Green... It's like he adores himself. I bet you anything he re-reads his own books. Just to see exactly how awesome they are. VH: What? You don't know that. You cannot possibly say that. How dare you talk about him like you know him.Me: You know, in the audio version of The Fault in Our Stars, at the end, there's an interview with him. And he explicitly says that he just LOVES listening to the audio versions of his books. So there.VH: What? No. You're wrong. He doesn't mean, like, he loves it when someone reads him his own books. That's not what he meant AT ALL. It's a misunderstanding. What he meant was, he loves listening to the.. the.. reading lady. Because she has such a sweet voice and everything. Me: Are you kidding me? He's in love with himself! Augustus is just an hologram. An empty shell. Seriously, his monologues are laughable. I couldn't even focus. I kept thinking of John Green while reading. Because Augustus is just SO witty, so smart, so perfect. *cough cough* wish fulfillment hello.VH: I am so not convinced.Me: There's this whole repetition thing, too. I cannot believe how all the characters of his books look alike. How come it works every SINGLE time? How many books are out there, now? 4? 5? More, surely. It's always the SAME THING. Geeky and nerdy narrator, geekier and nerdier sidekick, mysterious but unbelievable girl, random plot that doesn't even make sense, road trip. Come the fuck on. You know what? The fact that people aren't getting tired of him and his stupid same characters is the real question.VH: But this book is unique. The way it deals with cancer and death... It's so beautiful. You cannot possibly say it isn't.Me: That's what disturbed me the most. Look. What I want to say is, not every death is glorious. Not every death is epic and not every death will glow like a star in the eternal twilight sky. Most of the time, deaths are random, plain, and the world is cold and uncaring, and that's how it is. And that's what's terrible. You don't need to be a hero, you don't need to defy death the way Augustus pretends to, you don't need to lose yourself in unbelievable speeches to have people cry over your death. The book is just TOO much. VH: You know, about them being unbelievable when they talk? You seem to forget something. Augustus and Hazel ARE different. They're unique, so they talk different. That's what it's all about.Me: They're not different, they don't exist. They can't exist. Honestly? I don't think this was a good tribute to the kids who are really sick. Because no one talks like that, NO ONE, and I feel like now there's this messed-up hierarchy between the sick kids who are sort of smart ass and those who aren't. And I refuse that. I can't accept that. Being ironic, jaded, detached and all metaphorical over the disease is a luxury that genuinely sick teenagers cannot afford. So fuck this. And I'd rather kneel before a kid who has cancer and who doesn't know what a metaphor is than shed a tear over one of Augustus's stupid monologues.VH: You liar, I know you cried while you read the book. You were a sobbing mess.Me: I wasn't. I was a sobbing mess at the end of Before I Die. And oh my God, I couldn't even speak after I finished A Monster Calls because I was crying so hard. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl had me in tears, too. These are all gorgeous books that deal with cancer. And I cried like a bitch every single time, and they broke my heart. But this? I didn't cry.VH: You did, and you know it. Especially at THIS special moment.Me: *looks away* I don't know what you're talking about.VH : You cried when Hazel asked her mom if she would still be a mom after her death.Me: Fine, okay. I cried. I know. Okay? I know. But look. That's precisely the point. That's what I call emotional blackmail. Because I DARE YOU not to cry over that discussion. Because it's a universal fear! Whether you're a mom, or a daughter, or both, if you have a sister even, you must have thought about that already and told yourself : Okay, if I die, or if she dies. Who will I be? If my sister dies and I'm asked whether I have a sibling, what should I say? Am I still a sister because she existed, once? Or if you have a child, and then one day your baby dies. What happens then? Are you still a parent? Are you still a parent because once, you used to be a parent, and because there's a room upstairs that used to be your child's? I dare you to think about it and not end up crying. I took it as a betrayal from John Green because I feel like he didn't play fair. OF COURSE talking about a child's death in this peculiar way will make the reader cry! But it's so easy. It doesn't require any talent. Just ask anyone to talk about that and they'll be tearing up in 5 seconds! Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I feel like he was like, ""I'm gonna make them cry."" and all the while I was reading I swear I could hear him: ""ARE YOU SAD YET? ARE YOU HEARTBROKEN YET? DO YOU SEE HOW INCREDIBLY UPSETTING MY STORY IS? I KNOW, RIGHT. I AMAZE MYSELF SOMETIMES.""VH: But--Me: No, look. Writing like that, it's not incredible, it's not magical and it's not valuable. It's playing with people's weaknesses. It's manipulating people into crying. And I can't respect him with that the way I respect people who manage to make me cry without using such poor plot devices. Like in, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl. There's a cancer book that really took me by surprise. Because, Rachel, the sick girl, is everything but admirable. She's young, a bit shallow, nice, shy, plain, normal, really. And her neighbor who befriends her, he doesn't fall in love with her. And her death won't be remembered like something that scarred humanity, because it didn't. Ultimately, it didn't even matter at all. And I could relate more easily to that, to the meaningless dimension of her death, to the emptiness of it all, more than I could ever relate to the ridiculous speeches of Augustus (and Hazel's too, for that matter). Because you know what bothered me, too? They're indistinct. VH: That's because they're soul mates. That's the whole point of the book. They found themselves in each other.Me: It doesn't work to say they're soul mates. Look, I read the book almost a year ago, I think. And this:“I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.”
Me: This is beautiful, granted. It's also unrealistic that a teenager would ever say that, let alone improvize it, but whatever, it's pretty. But the thing is, I am completely unable to say whether it's Augustus or Hazel who says that. I don't know. I have no idea. I try to recognize the style, but I can't tell, BECAUSE THEY TALK EXACTLY THE SAME.VH: ...Me: So yeah. I didn't love the book, and I am not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things; I didn't love the book, and I know this review might be just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed to another John Green book about an unbelievable loser and his even more loser sidekick loving an unbelievable teenage girl, and that there will come a day when maybe he will change his writing formula, and maybe that'll come when the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, but then it'll be too late, so who cares? I didn't love this book.VH: *suspiciously silent*Me: Are we done?VH: FINE. Ugh. Okay. *Waves white flag* I surrender.Me: Yes! *clicks ""save review""*",3.0
166,Divergent,,4.14,"['April', '25,', '2011']","What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I could feel what the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No I know how to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.  Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check. Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another. Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have a reason for something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to the selfless people'....and later being like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up. You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW, HOW is everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has a special brain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of. AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me.",2.0
167,Twilight,"Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.",3.65,"['October', '5,', '2005']","Okay, I have to say that I picked this book up partly due to all the hype (and partly because it's involved two of my favorite genres)... I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least tried to.Let me first say that I am a huge romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I really wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, very wrong. A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:1. Lack of characterization:Bella- Okay... I absolutely hated this girl. She was the worst female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be that dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is very unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have loved for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very ""plain"" looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I hate Mary Sues.Edward- Okay, this boy is just way too possessive and stalkerish (it is not romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and ""bad boys"" usually don't sit there and say ""I'm dangerous, stay away"" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.2. Writing style:Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. 3. Descriptions:I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is that shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was so much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so ""hot"", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was ""hot"" or not.Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus sparingly (aka: only when it is truly needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.4. Plot:Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something finally happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, ""Look, there's a plot right there."", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole ""romance"" between Bella and Edward is not the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.5. Plot holes The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens never aged! And the ""children"" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that someone would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of that many morons! (Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...) Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so ""human loving"" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to ""fit in"", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not that uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his ""siblings"" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: ""Well it is a fictional vampire book."" That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.6. VampiresLike I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost ""misunderstood"" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they are creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures do not sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that sparkles in the sun. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think ""vampire"" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special ""powers"", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are ""vegetarian"" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: ""Write what you know"". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.7. MessagesI am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. (All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. (Bella goes on and on and on about how hot some part of Edward is every other page)3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are so very important. (Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. (It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is wrong with people these days?!)5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for everything.(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. (Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. (This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.8. The Obsession:Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward ""belongs"" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected much better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a much better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!And, oh just for the record... Twilight is NOT the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually has talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.Though, it does make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should really take a look at this.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0

It's ""Philosopher's Stone"" for me or no stones at all!01/12/2020 - 9%(1) ""People in cloaks! Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the getups you saw on young people!""- With the movies, it's easy to forget that everyday wizard attire involves brightly colored cloaks and pointy hats.(2) McGonagall: ""There will be books written about Harry – every child in our world will know his name!""01/13/2020 - 16%(1) Harry gets Dudley's second room, which seems very much like the Room of Requirement. It's used to hide Dudley's disused and broken things, but now functions as a bedroom.(2) If this snake was bred in captivity, and doesn't often speak to humans, how does it speak Portuguese? I suppose there's some Parseltongue iteration of Portuguese.01/14/2020 - 23%(1) Hagrid: ""'The gold ones are Galleons,' he explained. 'Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle.'""- It's interesting that despite UK decimalization, wizards still use a kind of £sd currency. They're sort of American that way: resisting metric.(2) A knut is a wizard penny, I presume after King Cnut the Great.01/15/2020 - 34%(1) Harry: ""What are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?""Hagrid: ""School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but–""Harry: ""I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,"" said Harry gloomily.""- Hufflepuff does sound like it's for stoners.(2) Ron's both shocked and impressed that Harry said ""Voldemort."" Sort of like cursing, uttering his name.01/16/2020 - 43%(1) ""Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. 'GRYFFINDOR!' shouted the hat. Ron groaned.""- And thus begins our enemies-to-lovers romance.(2) ""Ickle"" must be Britishism of Britishisms. I've only ever seen it in ""Harry Potter"" books.(3) Hope my GIFs are well-received. Let me know if they ever get annoying.01/17/2020 - 55%(1) ""The students all hated [Filch], and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.""- Well, as long as they don't actually kick the cat.(2) Re: Football: ""Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.""- I dislike soccer for separate, non-magical, reasons.01/18/2020 - 62%(1) Ron saves Hermione from the troll. When it comes to Hermione, Harry's invariably placid, it's always fireworks with Ron.(2) Before I knew better, I used to think ""Hermione"" was pronounced ""hermy-won.""(3) ""Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 'Weird!' he said, 'What a shape! This is money?'""- I guess heptagons aren't common among wizards.01/19/2020 - 69%(1) The problem with the library's ""restricted section"" is that anyone can go there. Just keep them locked in a separate room, there must be hundreds of those available.(2) Remembralls are about as useful as tying string around your finger.(3) Harry: ""How did you know – ?""Dumbledore: ""I don't need a cloak to become invisible.""- Totally pwned!01/20/2020 - 73%(1) “Ron and Hermione [were] playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.”- I agree, it keeps her humble and open to suggestions.- It’s good for Ron too, having something he’s best at.(2) I love how openly biased teachers are toward their houses. It makes them more human.01/21/2020 - 77%(1) Ron and Neville fist fight Malfoy, Crabbe & Goyle. If you ask me, Malfoy's Ron's nemesis not Harry's.(2) ""Hermione... had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.""- Pressuring idiosyncrasies is weird... like making friends dress like you.01/22/2020 - 84%(1) Filch: ""Hang you by your wrists... I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed.""- Not an awful idea, motives aside. Manacles can be handy.(2) ""Snape made them all nervous... while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.""- Trick question! Potion fumes might cause them to forget!01/23/2020 - 90%(1) The difference between J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan is that Rowling plays the long game, building scenes toward the climax. Whereas Riordan plays in short bursts, ping-ponging from one mini-quest to another. Here, for example, Ron being best at chess, Hagrid giving Harry a flute, Peeves being scared of the Bloody Baron, etc., all pay-off at the climax.01/24/2020 - 90%(1) Dumbledore: ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""- Wonder why Dumbledore doesn't give this advice to everyone? Surely people would listen.(2) Lost in the narrative is that Harry kills a guy. Literally kills him with the power of love... it's a curious thing.",4.0
169,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,,4.57,"['July', '8,', '2000']","(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:03/15/2020 - Preamble(1) I've said it before in comment replies, but I've always considered books 4-7 to be four parts of one very long book, which I call the ""Voldemort is Back Saga.""(2) Attending the Wizarding World Cup was mentioned at the end of ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" I think the only other tease of events to come was book six when HRH decided to leave Hogwarts.03/16/2020 - 2%(1) The opening chapter is the first one not in Harry's POV. Another aspect that separates the latter books from the first three.(2) The village of Little Hangleton reminds me a lot of Pagford from ""The Casual Vacancy."" Both feature an abandoned manor house, for example. I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020 - 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020 - 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020 - 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020 - 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020 - 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020 - 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020 - 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020 - 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020 - 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020 - 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020 - 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020 - 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020 - 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020 - 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020 - 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020 - 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020 - 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020 - 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020 - 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020 - 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020 - 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020 - 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020 - 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020 - 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020 - 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020 - 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020 - 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020 - 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020 - 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020 - 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020 - 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020 - 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020 - 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.""- Interesting how, despite not hearing the prophesy, Voldemort came to the same solution on his own. Albeit for different reasons.(2) Bellatrix is the worst kind of groupie.(3) Tonks and Lupin are married already? I guess they eloped.08/05/2020 - 4%(1) I don't want to attribute symbolism where there might be none, but wizards really do react to their wands being broken like they've been gelded.(2) ""The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.""- Hermione has been plenty stupid before. It's just that hers has to do with common sense.08/06/2020 - 6%(1) ""What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike?""- I mean, saying nothing is always an option, that is, if you dislike them enough to not even want to talk.(2) It wouldn't surprise me at all if Dedalus Diggle was modeled after the White Rabbit. He's short, constantly checks his giant pocket watch, and always worries about being late.08/07/2020 - 8%(1) Re Polyjuice: '""Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,"" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly.'- Foreshadowing the later Ron subplot.(2) '""Hold tight now, Ron,"" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on ... her waist.'- Well, can't look too eager.08/08/2020 - 11%(1) Lupin: ""Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!""- Exactly what I've been saying!(2) 'Hermione flew at [Ron] and hugged him tightly.

She's not Ginny!(2) Ron's addicted to hugs now... well, hugging Hermione.(3) ""Gabrielle ... threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.""- That's right, girl. Mark your territory.08/10/2020 - 18%(1) Harry's already got Ginny, so why does Ron gift him a book on getting girls?(2) ""You've really got an eye for that sort of thing.""""Thank you, Ron!"" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry [smiled] to himself.

She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up.

I guess there's a difference between erasing a memory and implanting false ones.(2) Ron takes every chance to hug Hermione. So he's either an opportunist or formed a habit.08/13/2020 - 26%(1) ""[Hermione's] fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands.

You want the facts, try the Quibbler.""- Ah, in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king... or however it goes.(2) Ron: ""We're about as near getting rid of [the horcrux] as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!""- ""Effing""?

Lavender, for one, seemed to love his breath.(2) Rita Skeeter openly admits to using Veritaserum on Bathilda Bagshot. Last I checked, that was illegal.08/23/2020 - 49%Ah, relationship back to normal. ¡La pasión!(1) Riddle: ""Least loved, always ... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend ...

I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.""- Didn't seem that way in the film... funny way to act toward your sister.(2) Ron destroys the locket and then has himself a big Hermione-cry. Eh, he was due. Seeing as she has four big Ron-cries under her belt.08/25/2020 - 53%(1) Hermione to Harry: ""Maybe it's something you need to find out for yourself.""Ron: ""Yeah! ... That makes sense.""Hermione: ""No, it doesn't!""- Being anti-Ron conflicts with being logical.(2) Harry: ""You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.""Ron: ""All's fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both.""- Aww, he loves her... I'm sure not as a sister.08/26/2020 - 55%(1) '""There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —""""Midnight, our mum always told us,"" said Ron ...

I didn't really believe it!""- Questionable morals, that Hermione.08/28/2020 - 60%(1) Why bother to change your name if you don't want anyone to say it?(2) '""What is it, Wormtail?"" called Lucius Malfoy from above.""Nothing!"" Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail's wheezy voice. ""All fine!""'- I didn't know Ron could imitate voices. Must be a hit at parties.(3) Wonder if it still counts as suicide if your arm has a mind of its own?08/29/2020 - 62%(1) Harry uses three wands at once to stupefy Greyback... makes you wonder whether multiple-core wands are a thing, or why no one owns more than one wand.- It'd probably be akin to using a machine gun.(2) ""With a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.""08/30/2020 - 64%(1) ""The steady rhythm of [Harry's] arms beat time with his thoughts.

Horcruxes ...""- In the end, he chooses horcruxes.(2) Hermione and Luna wearing Fleur's clothes is a touch of hilarity beneath the sadness.(3) ""Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.""- Aww... it's like a bicycle-built-for-two.08/31/2020 - 66%(1) Olivander: ""Walnut and dragon heartstring ... Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.""- As a woodworker, I can say that walnut has high acidity, and is one of the few species too toxic for mulch.(2) Hermione: ""I'm a Mudblood!""Ron: ""Don't call yourself —""Hermione: ""Why shouldn't I? ... Mudblood, and proud of it!""09/01/2020 - 68%(1) Bill: ""Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you'll know all that from History of Magic.""- Yes, History of Magic... smile and nod.(2) '""Hermione and Fleur both squealed, ""Congratulations!"" and Ron said, ""Blimey, a baby!"" as if he had never heard of such a thing before.'- To be fair, Ron was a year old when Ginny was a baby.09/02/2020 - 70%(1) '""You'll be using [Bellatrix's] actual wand,"" said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, ""so I reckon you'll be pretty convincing."" Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her.'- Just don't use it for firewood or compost... walnut's toxic.(2) Harry casts the Imperius Curse which, while Unforgivable, is probably forgivable in this instance.09/03/2020 - 72%(1) ""Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.""- Ah, how very Ron and Hermione. How they each handle stress strikes at the heart of their personalities.(2) I think it's indicative of how good a job he's done that I've not mentioned Stephen Fry at all during this re-read.09/04/2020 - 75%(1) '""Accio Cloak!"" roared one of the Death Eaters. Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.'- Well, it must be a real Hallow then, not summonable and thus not subject to other magic.(2) 'It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, ""Expecto Patronum!""'- Aww... they're Harry's happy thought!09/05/2020 - 77%(1) Ron: ""Yeah, well, food's one of the five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.""- Hermione must be beaming.(2) Seamus: ""We've been hiding out [in the Room of Requirement] ... and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —""Lavender: ""— and thought they'd quite like to wash, yes.""- So... boys don't ""require"" washing?09/06/2020 - 79%(1) Harry uses the Cruciatus Curse and McGonagall uses the Imperius Curse. Sure, rules get thrown out when it comes to war, but do the ends justify the means?(2) In the film McGonagall duels Snape one-on-one until he flees. In the book, it's Flitwick that runs Snape off.(3) 'Professor McGonagall dryly, ""we teachers are rather good at magic, you know.""'- Ha! Sassy.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

No longer shiny metal against still skies. Now it's rusty, pitted metal against billowing clouds.(2) Prior to my current re-read of the series, this was my favorite. Before that it was ""Half-Blood Prince."" Wonder if it'll keep its position or if I'll have a new favorite this time.05/05/2020 - 4%(1) Harry: ""Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too?""- Oh, I can think of a few reasons...(2) Harry openly insulting his aunt and uncle and picking a fight with Dudley?

Someone’s been listening to Radiohead.05/06/2020 - 6%(1) If you’re a wizard, don’t give your kids the initials AF, they’ll likely be a squib: Arabella Figg, Argus Filch.- Mrs. Figg's cat keeps tabs on Harry.

Can't be that insistent on it.05/08/2020 - 9%(1) Tonks: ""Are you mad, Mad-Eye?""- Well, it's in the name. Though it could just be the eye that's mad.(2) House elf heads line the hallway of Sirius' place.

Not so much because it’s ugly, but mainly because it’s muggle attire. You know who else wears muggle clothes? Fudge. Umbridge is an insincere flatterer who does, or wears, anything to get to the top. A simple pink cardigan can say a lot about personality.05/19/2020 - 27%(1) ""Harry was too used to [Ron and Hermione's] bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his ... steak-and-kidney pie.""- Smart.

When she's stressed she gets bossy, when she can't get her way she gets stressed, and so on.(2) Ron spots Harry's scarred hand and implores him to tell McGonagall or Dumbledore.- Yet another Ron scene given to Hermione in the film.(3) Knitting things no one wants is yet another trait Hermione has in common with Molly.05/24/2020 - 35%(1) Ron makes the Quidditch team by process of elimination. Two people fared better at keeper tryouts, but Angelina found one whiny and the other unreliable. Thank goodness for that!(2) ""[Harry] walked on, feeling quietly elated ...

174,New Moon,"I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.",3.59,"['September', '6,', '2006']","Stephen King once said, ""Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good."" I couldn't agree more, Stephen. With that, we shall kick this off with a joke:

Heh. This re-reading is brought to you courtesy of Project: Hindsight. 

I'm sorry folks. I just could not get through this shit book another time. However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously, how is it possible a book with almost no plot can be so long? When I first read New Moon back in 2008, I didn't like it. In fact I'm not even sure why it had three stars because I remember being super frustrated. Even though Edward and Bella's relationship deeply disturbs my soul, Bella is so incredibly boring without him. I'm not even sure how Stephenie Meyer managed 563 pages. Truly, I'm amazed because I can sum up New Moon in one big picture:

But let's get on with it, I'll go into some detail for ya.The book starts off on Bella's 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward. So, she makes a huge production about people not celebrating her birthday, but the Cullens ignore her and Alice plans a party. Before Edward forces her to attend they watch Romeo and Juliet (the book's supposed theme) and they have merry little conversation about Edward's contingency plans once Bella dies. Now, let's not forget they've only been dating for a few months. Yet, here they are making out and talking about killing themselves in the event of the other's death. How romantic. Don't even ask me the logic behind how they can even kiss when his teeth are supposed to be ""venom coated."" Stephenie Meyer gives some bull shit excuse she must have learned from ass-grab 101. But I digress...Finally, they make it to the birthday party. Bella gets a paper cut and Jasper almost single-handedly ends this series on page 29.

 Unfortunately, to my dismay his attempt was foiled by Edward. Eddie pushes Bella out the way and she crashes into the glass plates, slashing up her arm. Pause, let's think about that scene a bit: Who's bright idea was it to have glass plates? With a human. In a room full of vampires. That drink blood. Isn't Alice psychic? Why didn't she see Bella cutting her finger on the wrapping paper? Wait, don't think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we'll never get through this review.Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for...wait for it...being human. Bella, you know you've been hanging out with mythical creatures too much when you start thinking your humanity isn't normal. But anyway, Eddie does what any loving boyfriend would do after their girlfriend is attack by their brother: he ignores her. And because Eddie is ""Alpha Male Edward"" and Bella is ""Submissive Mary Sue Bella,"" she doesn't confront him about it. Instead, she waits for him to be ready. On the third day of ignoring her, he drags he into the words and chucks up the deuces. The exchange goes a little like this:

Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, ""No, I don't want you to come. You're no good for me."" And she pretty much agrees realizing how much of a waste of space she is. Then Edward just pours salt all over her open wound and tells her: 
""Don't do anything reckless or stupid,"" he ordered, no longer detached. ""Do you understand what I'm saying?...I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself--for him.""I nodded helplessly.
 Wow. Relly? You're just going to let him order you around like that? How about you look after yourself FOR YOU first, everyone else second? Awesome Bells. Can I call you Bells? Not only do you have ZERO self-preservation skills, but also no self-confidence. Just awesome. There's only about a million or so girls looking up to you as a role model. No pressure to be a strong female character. You could have walked away from this with grace, but no, instead all your dignity flies out the window when you pull a bitch move and run after Edward through the woods.

Then, she defaults back to ""Fuck my life"" mode and slips into a depression for four fucking months. I find it kind of funny her depression was longer than their actual relationship. Heh. But this wasn't just any depression, it was some serious shit. 
I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it.
 Or how about this: 
Even my outsides looked different--my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that--if I were beautiful and seen from a distance--I might even pass for a vampire now.
 Once again I find myself asking the question: Where are her parents?! Why did Charlie let this go on for FOUR months?! She should have been in counseling or something. But Meyer thinks she can just pacify readers by Renee sending a random e-mail here and there or Charlie just suggesting she seek help, only to be shot down by Bella. Fail. So much fail. All that considered, that's not even the biggest problem I have with this book. Bella soon figures out she can conjure up hallucinations of Edward if she does something reckless or suicidal. This is where Jake comes into play. Bella uses Jake (like everyone else) to get what she wants by asking him to fix up two motorcycles she found and giving her riding lessons. She figures it will be the perfect thing to help her see more of Edward. I suppose she simply forgot how big of a klutz she is and once the bikes are fixed the lessons commence. The first time she gets on she falls off and Jake (the only one with common sense) thinks they should call it a day before she gets hurt. But Bella thinks this is BK and she can have it her way, and gets back on the bike. 





Chick has gone batshit crazy and she promptly busts her ass. But she doesn't care because her mission was a success! She got to see and hear Edward! Her next brilliant idea is to throw herself off a cliff during high tide. The first time I read this I was secretly hoping she would drown, but the other two books already were published, so it was a hopeless wish. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the actual plot. LOL. Funny how that happens when there isn't one, huh? LOL. The She-vamp, Victoria, is scoping out the area trying to get to Bella. But her part is VERY small in this book (like the plot), so we don't really need to talk about her. I suppose the wolf pack is worth mentioning: They're pretty much a bunch of wannabe werewolves that run around with their shirts off. 



That's all you really need to know about them. So, finally Alice shows up in chapter 18 because she thought Bella was trying to commit suicide (close enough Alice). And through a nice little exchange of ""he said, she said"" BS, Edward is off to Italy to kill himself. This causes Bella to go into ""hero"" mode and race to Italy and save Edward. I really don't care enough to give my thoughts on the race to Italy. That entire part was rushed and anti-climatic. There isn't even a fight scene. Instead here is a timeline courtesy of Reasoning with Vampires (Thanks for the link Cait and Jen!):

Anyway, they get back to good old Forks and Bella composes a vote on everyone's thoughts of her joining team undead. Edward is at a steady ""no"" along with Rosalie. But everyone else says, ""Hell yes!"" Like becoming a vampire is a party or something. Funny thing is when Bella asks Jasper he goes:

And she's all:

Hmm, yeah, that's not weird at all. Not the least bit creepy.In the last few pages Edward and Jake have a little pissing contest and Edward proposes to Bella. The End. Yawn. Thank God it's over. Now where's my fuckin' chocolate?My Twilight Review can be found here.***BONUS***Oh, yeah, bonus time. 'Cause what's a review without one?Quick! If I were to light Edward on fire what would he become?

I saw swan lake retelling and was instantly fascinated.Summary: Fia is a rare changeling who was left behind by the wicked Fae when they stole the Queen’s daughter. Despite many people hating her heritage the Queen raises her as a daughter and trains her to be a spy and to fight. One day the queen tasks her and Rogan(childhood friend and other princess betrothed) to go to the Fae realm to bring back her daughter and break her swan curse. The Queen also tasks her with a separate mission to seduce the Fae prince in order to retrieve a desired object that wields magic.

🌿enemies to lovers🌿friends to lovers🌿dare i say star crossed lovers?
Here is what you can expect
✔️ morally gray shadow daddy 🩶🥵✔️complex characters ✔️love triangle ✔️touch her and die vibes 🔪✔️Celtic mythology✔️unique magic-heroine has botanical magic 🌿✔️story telling/riddles✔️HFNFia grows up wanting to only be loved and has to constantly prove her worth to others due to her fae heritage. She is trained to be an assassin and goes through much abuse by the queen’s right hand. I found her to be an extremely likable and relatable heroine. She’s learning who she is as a woman and discovering herself. While also having to discover the truth because everyone is spinning a different tale. She’s strong, fierce, funny, but also vulnerable and wants to feel true love.Rogan is her childhood best friend and the prince who is betrothed to the princess. He always showed her kindness and as they grew older they fell in love with each other. But due to political reasons he did not choose her and this broke Fia. Do I dislike Rogan? Yes and no. He’s a product of his environment and has been fed lies distorting his beliefs. During their mission feelings com back and confuses the lines of their friendship. I believe he does love Fia in his own way but not all parts of her.Irian aka shadow daddy 🤪 is mysterious, dangerous, powerful and full of secrets. Something about a man that tries to kill you upon meeting is kind of hot ..talk about a meet-cute 🤭 I will fall hard for any morally gray character it’s a natural given..I’m hoping in the next book we get more information about him he’s an intriguing character. I loved their moments together he loves Fia fiercely and allows her to be herself. 
Spice Level
2.5/5 🌶️It was much spicier than I thought and I’m in no way complaining. Overall, I highly recommend if you are a romantasy girlie. The writing will leave you entranced and longing for more. The ending I did not see coming whatsoever I’m still gathering my emotions because it was intense. I loved this so much and desperately need the second book. I will also be buying this in hardcover so I can highlight and annotate.Thank you to Netgallery and Orbit Books for this Arc!!

Her first book in The Shadow Age series, 
Three Kinds of Lucky

However, as a sweeper first-class she’s turned her ability to handle the damaging magical waster generated by mages into a decent life working at the mage’s university.However, when her childhood acquaintance Benedict Strom needs someone with her abilities for his research project, she gets stuck working on his team. However, he doesn’t understand magical waste the way she does. When an accident occurs, they go on the run to seek the one person who might we able to help. Grady learns of hidden talents that could risk the world has they know it.Grady can be surly and sour due to the way sweepers are treated, but she is great at her job and can even smell magic. Sweepers are considered low status, but they’re in high demand. Despite this, they are treated with condescension. Benedict is sure his project can revolutionize how magical waste is dealt with, but he’s not good at explaining complex things to others.Besides great characterization, the worldbuilding is excellent. The stunning plot has twists and turns as the story builds momentum. There is plenty of action, conflict, and suspense as well as a few surprises along the way. Wait until you read the incredible conclusion!Overall, this was an entertaining story with compelling characters, excellent world-building, gripping scenes, and a magic system that is unique. Accepting responsibility, treatment of others, friendship, betrayal, death, trust, and power play various roles in this exciting story. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

182,Floating Hotel,"This cozy debut science fiction novel tells a story of misfits, rebels, found family—and a mystery that spans the stars.",3.78,"['March', '19,', '2024']","What a fun read to kick off the new year! Each chapter of Floating Hotel features a different passenger or crew member on board the hulking Grand Abeona Hotel as it saunters through the galaxy and Grace Curtis paints vivid portraits of the ragtag cadre of characters. While spending limited time with and shifting through each person’s perspective may be disorienting for some, there is a captivating mystery at the core of the book that provides a compelling thread connecting each distinct section.The tone of the book vibrates on a similar frequency as Josiah Bancroft’s “Books of Babel” series — there are airships, class divides, a dash of whimsy, and a hodgepodge of peculiar characters, each aboard the vessel for a different reason.There were some deliciously dark details that might make some question the “cozy” genre classification, but the story and characters exude charm, Curtis’s writing flows beautifully, and I raced through each chapter until reaching the final page. All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time spent aboard the Grand Abeona Hotel.My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review.See this review and others at

183,Song of the Huntress,,3.85,"['March', '19,', '2024']","The stronger aspect of this book is also its biggest weakness: the writing is pretty and has a good rhythm overall, but it's also prone to archaisms and the occasional purple-prosery; and it uses third person present tense narration for a POV, too, which some readers don't enjoy, me amongst them. On top of that, the pace of the story is so painfully slow it's very tempting to abandon the book for the slow-as-molasses progress and the unnecessary roundabouts. It makes the book easy to put down and resume later, yes, but also very easy to forget.Set in 8th century Britain, Song of the Huntress has a trio of protagonists: Herla, the leader of the Wild Hunt, Æthelburg, Queen of Wessex, and Ine, King of Wessex, and pretends to be a character-driven story of struggle, personal growth, and power, faith, and politics in times when Anglo-Saxons vie for the rule of the new lands they conquer and conflict arises between the old and the new religions. If you're interested in this time period, the historical novel with low magic feel of this book should be far more enjoyable to you than if you aren't, as is my case. But regardless of personal investment in the period, it's probably the characters that'll hold your interest most, although for me it didn't work that way either as it was very hard to connect or care about them for how unrelatable and distant they felt. I did find Ine a tad more interesting as a character than either Herla or Æthelburg, though, who are a bit more stereotypical (in the ""strong women"" cliché sense), mainly because it's the first time I see a man of that era struggling with asexuality and it was intriguing to see. Historically accurate? No, not really, pre-modern views and understanding of sexuality weren't like ours, which is why I find the much-lauded queer representation here rather forced, but your mileage may vary, as they say.There's really not much else to say, it really was this dull for me personally; little happening, much describing, and characterisation that could've been much more fetching.

As often is the case, Nhika falls into the trap of being naïve and cliché.

This is a start. (Make sure you pick up The Crossbow of Destiny in August.)Where so many of the Asian fantasies seem to go wrong is the glorification of colonization. I will be the first to admit that I was worried about how this would turn out. Fear not, Nhika is very proud to be Yarongese.

I wrote it because, once upon a time, I was a teenaged Nice Catholic Girl trying to figure out what it meant that I was irrevocably in love with pagan gods due to all the Greek and Norse mythology I had read. And I wrote it because, in my twenties and thirties, I was a Nice Catholic Girl learning to reckon with all the sins that had been committed in the name of my faith.I also wrote it because, back in mid-2017, I couldn't stop reading Reylo meta, even though at the time I was still fooling myself into believing I didn't ship it.

186,The Wicked King,The enchanting and bloodthirsty sequel to the New York Times bestselling novel The Cruel Prince.,4.30,"['January', '8,', '2019']","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★

“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”

Many of you might not know this but on this day many years ago, Holly Black’s biggest fan was born. Spoiler: it’s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn’t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I’m just that extra, but The Wicked King is perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I’ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. But every time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I’d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too. The Wicked King is the second installment in The Folk of the Air series, the first being my favorite book of 2017, The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So, please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled for The Cruel Prince!

“I want to tell you so many lies.”

(The most breathtaking fanart by Loweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is *clutches pearls forever* the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn’t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them. 

“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”

And everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase “twists and turns” doesn’t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won’t know who or what to believe, and you surely won’t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page. And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren’t wrong. You all thought The Cruel Prince cliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won’t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I’m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I’ve ever read in my entire life. Okay, I’m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also, Roiben plays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it! (My favorite fanart(s) by PhantomRin!)➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love. 

“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I’m so sorry, neighbors, if you’re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of “book boyfriends” until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - I’m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I’ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he’s going to be the “big bad” of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play. 

“I wish he hadn’t used me to test my sister’s love for him. I wish she hadn’t let him.”

➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I’m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella, The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it’s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I’m ready for it. Oh, and in case I haven’t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don’t say that lightly. I thought in The Cruel Prince that it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while reading The Wicked King I realized that it’s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you’ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don’t even know how I’m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical. 

“You are my dearest punishment.”

But this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it’s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully. 

“It’s easy to put your own life on the line, isn’t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.”

I’m not sure I’ve ever been as happy reading a book as I’ve been reading The Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It’s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word. 

“He looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don’t. We don’t share anything.”

Overall, this review doesn’t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos, Frank Ocean, and The Wicked King by Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it’s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I’d just ask for more.

187,The Queen of Nothing,He will be destruction of the crown and the ruination of the throne.,4.36,"['November', '19,', '2019']","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★2.) The Wicked King ★★★★★

“By you, I am forever undone.”

I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending. Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.) I vlogged this entire reading experience (and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened in The Cruel Prince, The Lost Sisters, & The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later! After the very heartbreaking end of The Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter. 

“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”

Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death. It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted. 

“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”

And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence. 

“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”

Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly. This next section of my review is going to have SPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not read The Queen of Nothing and all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart. 

“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”

➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. 

“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - We love a good redemption arc, wow. ➽ 
 Grima Mog
 - Nothing but love and respect for my war general. ➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers. ➽ 
 Vivi
 - My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking. ➽ 
 Oak
 - Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off. ➽ 
 Madoc
 - Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup. Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying. I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that. 

“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”

I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read. I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie. I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me. Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the way The Folk of the Air has made me feel.

188,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,,3.95,"['May', '19,', '2020']","For all of their faults, The Hunger Games books a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,  I loved it shamelessly,  warts and all .And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow. The Emperor Palpatine of that universe (I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty? 
I think this book will alienate quite a few of Hunger Games fans. You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. But The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes makes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become. You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here (or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes). I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. But he has some humanity in him - capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice. The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it. He chooses complicity — and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey. 
 “So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”
 
This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.
 “We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”
It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it only as far as it suits his comfort. Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.
 “His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”
No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow. There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion. Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans. But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can reread The Hunger Games trilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.

  y'allll when I tell you this line made me- ALEXA PLAY LITERALLY ANY LOVE SONG BY TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE EVAJACKS ARE EVERYTHING AND SO IS TAYLOR SWIFT.(there will be spoilers if you haven't read this book so be wary!)Ok so here we finally are. The book we finally deserve after that HORRENDOUS ending to The Ballad of Never After (I loved that ending so much despite how much pain it caused me) and it is finally here. And so is my review which I have been DYING to write ever since the book got announced, and ever since I finished this book.I have so many thoughts but I don't even know how to say them. As you can see, I rated this book 4 stars. It's gonna be more than 4 stars, but personally, it's not a 5 star book for me.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The PlotHm...where to begin. I'll just start from the beginning. Obviously. But anyways, the beginning of this book was actually a little slow. Mainly because Evangline was relearning everything after her memories were taken, and while I was lowkey stressed out, everything was jumping along pretty smoothly.When Apollo's first chapter came around, I literally rolled my eyes because I forgot that he even had chapters in this book. BUT. I was thankfully gifted a Jacks chapter a few chapters later, and that completely lifted my mood. In said chapter, we get THIS absolute gem of a quote that made me choke: “He'd never understood why someone would watch another person sleep...until her.”screaming.Things started to pick back up literally right after Jacks's chapter, which I cannot find as a coincidence, because Jacks just makes literally everything better. I was freaking out and hyperventilating for literally no reason at all for like the rest of the book, and let's just say, that's definitely an experience.After going back through my updates, let's just say, I got more and more unhinged as the book continued on and that's true, because the book got crazier and crazier.BUT. based on comments I keep getting, I'm pretty sure I know why Jacks uses his apples but now I know! All is well.Speaking of which, the epilogue killed me. Not because it's cute, because it wasn't, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST LINE. ""Other stories were brewing in the Magnificent North."" WHAT OTHER STORIES STEPHANIE?? I will need them asap thank you. it did feel a little bittersweet though, because the next stories probably won't be connected to any of the main characters from this series and Caraval. I'm still bitter that Tella didn't pop up in a cameo. I just realized I have so much more to say on the plot, but I've already written so much so here's my final comment on the plot: this book felt a lot more romance heavy than the others. There was just this super weird vibe around the book, as if it had lost all the magic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the romance, EvaJacks are my babies, but one of the reasons I love Caraval and OUABH so much was because of the magic, and this book just seemed to lack it.“She was the moth and Jacks was still the flame.”🤭｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The CharactersMy beloveds. My babies. My world. My everything.Ok, so with Evangeline, she's a really good main character, but the thing is, I hate her because I want to be her. I have issues, thank you, I know. Pushing that aside, she is a really good main character, because she makes....semi-rational decisions? Who am I kidding, Evangeline is such an idiot sometimes. There, I said it. She wasn't as much of an idiot in this book as she was in the last one, but she kept taking unnecessary risks that had me smacking my forehead because she could literally die. Her main character role saved her though. Other than that, I really like her.Jacks. Prince of Hearts. Archer. Jacks of the Hollow. I will be the Fox to his Archer any day, where can I find the sign up sheet? In all seriousness, I love Jacks so much. I used to hate him in the Caraval series when I first read it (LOOK it was only because I liked Tella and Legend together, all right?) but Jacks is now my bae and I am so sad that we won't get to read anything more about him. Jacks is the king of morally grey characters, though I will be honest: I liked him more when he was mean to Evangeline than in the end and they were all lovey dovey. I'm messed up like that, I like the enemies before the lovers 😭 In my review of The Ballad of Never After, I did a section where I listed some gems that came out of the Prince of Hearts's mouth so I will do that again, the ACFTL EDITION:“Please, Little Fox, remember.”hehe I think I cried at this part.“How can I make you understand,” he growled, “you and I together don't end well. We just end.”Preeetty sure I cried here too. Jacks sure knows how to make me cry.“This isn’t just for now, it’s for always, Little Fox.”We love a lovesick JacksAnyways, the other characters were pretty good too:Apollo deserved every single last thing that happened to him 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳LaLa and Chaos happening WHEN??? That one scene had me giggling so bad. Oh my gosh I NEED A BOOK ABOUT THEMAurora can go eat rocks 🫸 ⛰🤸🏼‍♀As usual, if I forgot any side characters, they don't matter or aren't important or relevant enough for me to try and remember them 🫶“Once upon a time, a girl who believed in fairytales stole the heart of a prince who had sworn to never love.”｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡The RelationshipWe have finally reached this point.As I said before, this book was super romance heavy, with so much denial, pining, angst, and longing. Despite all of this, I still wish there was more magic.But anywho, Evangeline and Jacks's story is so good, I can't even. Like the forbidden/enemies to lovers was so well done. Every time Jacks kept denying her out of love for her made me die and then buried me underground and put a headstone above my grave.The ending brought me back to life though, so I'm all good now.I talked about a few plot holes I thought I saw here, but apparently I wasn't paying much attention, sooo when I'm less occupied I will talk much more about EvaJacks because they are perfection.Anyways, I had to rant about that, but I love Evangeline and Jacks so much, and WHEN THEY FINALLY KISSED I LITERALLY SCREAMED BECAUSE I'D WAITED SINCE BOOK ONE FOR THAT MOMENT. Though I'm ngl that kiss was PATHETIC, I need more.“He gritted his teeth. “Being yours does not make you mine.”I distinctly remember opening my mouth in shock, closing the book dramatically, and then proceeded to roll around on my couch after hearing that.｡.｡:∞♡♥｡.｡Overall, this book was as good as I expected it to be, I just wish it had exceeded my expectations though!EvaJacks for life until the day I die.4.3 stars

190,Lightlark,,3.80,"['August', '23,', '2022']","EDIT 8/17/2022As someone who dropped one of the first comprehensive bad reviews on this book, I just wanna say I do not support the review bombing of it. It’s tacky and uncouth and what bigots do every time there are women in a TV show. We’re better than this. This situation could been a constructive conversation about the quality of a book, privileges, the highly commercialized state of publishing, the influence of tiktok, or false advertising, and instead we’re having NONE of those. Do not invalidate anyone’s identity. This is unproductive and invasive speculation. Focus on actions, on stuff that’s actually happening. C’mon, be real. _____________________I rarely use GoodReads, but because I received an advanced copy of the book, I thought it best to distribute this review across all platforms where I have an account. You can find me over on the storygraph, username bean. Thanks for the arc btw!Where to begin?I picked up this book because of tiktok. This book got picked up by a publisher because of tiktok. This book is a tiktok success story, an amalgamation of all that tiktok has to offer, and by extension, all the books that are popular on tiktok before it. Calling it pastiche would be kind. Each scene felt very reminiscent of something out of another YA book. Many, many YA books. So much of this book is borrowed from ACOTAR that any differentiation from the plot of ACOTAR felt like a subversion of story even if it made perfect sense within Lightlark's narrative. Also, I can proudly say that any comparison to the Hunger Games is unwarranted. It's a terrible comparison that sets up false expectations. More accurately, it's ACOTAR meets the Selection. Yeah. Before I really lay into this book, I'll say that I understand why people would like it. I understand the appeal. Some people like reading 100 different versions of the same kind of book. I get it. It's comforting. I am also that way with certain genres of books or types of movies. But comfort, familiarity, they're not tangible measures of storytelling quality. It's possible to be comforted and find excitement in something that suffers from flaws. So, make peace with that.I'll work my way up.The building blocks of story are prose. Aster's prose is not bad, but undercooked and sometimes repetitive. Unique metaphors are one-hit wonders, if you pull them out again, we will notice (hair like ink on his brow, buttery sunlight). It does not read like fantasy prose and feels entirely too modern. That was a problem deeper than prose, but certainly evident in the writing style. I had the privilege of consuming this novel on audiobook, and without the narrator, many writing faults would be more evident. (Also, I don't know how to spell any of these names because I read it on audiobook. So sorry for that.)That being said, it is consumable. I could get through it. I feel like I had an okay sense of where the characters were spacially. I knew where they were mentally because the author would just tell us. It's a common vice in Young Adult. The blatant explanations of Isla's struggle in her internal monologue and the faux femininist ideology of this book that would've been standard in the early 2010s really highlighted Sarah J Maas' writing as inspiration. Which kind of sucks, because her prose isn't good either.Now onto the premise. There are six rulers of six different realms trying to break their curses by competing in a Centennial, a game that takes place on an island that only emerges every hundred years. Simple enough? No it isn't.Listen, I am a seasoned fantasy reader. More than that, I was a Supernatural fan in my heyday. I have made sense of many things that do not make sense.This book did not make sense.First and foremost, it's impossible to get a real grasp on stakes. These lands have been suffering with their curses for five hundred years. And some of the curses are gnarly! The wildling's curse is that they have to eat a human heart every month to survive. But then, the people here live to be very old? Which, presumably means that they don't have very many children. The population can't be that high, because it wouldn't be sustainable if people are living longer. So how do they have even a year's supply of hearts? It's explained to us that the wildlings are dying, that their realm is losing power, that they don't have enough hearts to sustain them, but it's so hard to have a good grasp on exactly what's going on because there are so many variables that are vaguely explained. Are they at half their power, a tenth? How big are they compared to other realms? How many people do they lose a year? We need to understand the stakes! Please!For example, both of the love interests in this thing are over 500 years old. Yet, the starling curse is that their people don't live past the age of 25. How- I can't even wrap my head around it. In a world where people are living centuries, you give them a quarter of one, and barely explain its repercussions. Every single person in that realm was raised by teenagers. They're all young parents or teen moms. Saying that's the curse and that obviously it sucks and that's why their numbers are dwindling is not good enough, because I cannot understand the stakes. I don't understand how this was sustainable for 500 years and it's not anymore. I don't understand the ways the world has changed in a way that has material impacts on the average person besides ""yeah they'll die early"". Some of this stuff was touched on, but not developed. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm reading it with other people who got the arc, and we're all missing something then.Okay, slight tangent, but it's clear that this world was not thought about at all. Because, naturally, I feel like there would be more inter-realm interaction if they were all weakened? The wildling realm could get their hearts from starlings who die early. Starling would not be much of a realm of its own, but instead be an orphaned diaspora at risk of fizzling out. Other realms would take advantage of their naivete and lack of mentorship. And so on and so forth.There was some bending over backwards to explain away magial heirs and create the stakes that if someone dies in the game, their realm dies. We don't find out until like 75% throughout the book that people begin to age when they have kids because of passing down magic and heirs and whatever. She mentions elders, but then what would an elder be? How old would they be? If someone can live to a thousand without having kids and still look like they're in their 20s, is that an elder? How long do people live after they have kids? I feel like naturally, that would disincentivize having kids which once again begs the question where tf are the wildlings getting their hearts? I read this book with someone who spent the majority of it convinced that [redacted] was Isla's father, which wouldn't have been possible if any of this was actually made clear. I also might have missed it, but maybe only the realm rulers live hella long. I doubt it though because it seems like everyone in this world connected to a realm has powers. The fact that I can't tell really just proves how convoluted the worldbuilding was. My confusion effectively killed the stakes for this book, and I could not find a foothold for the forthcoming tension. I could keep going for like five pages trying to talk about how the worldbuilding was thoughtless and an active detriment to the story. Also how it feels ACOTAResque. I did not want to live in the Lightlark world. I don't even want to visit. I don't have a good grasp on how much magic is in the world, how they lived so long with the curses, how many people live there, or even what it looks like. I was imagining traditional fantasy stuff until homegirl mentions a bra and then I was like hold the phone. Hairclips and scrunchies don't even exist in this world, and she's out here with a BRA?The main character, Isla, is insufferable, though I've read worse. Her entire thing is not having agency, but then she'll regularly let her emotions get the better of her and make the entire situation worse when she does make decisions. I did not care for her. I felt like a lot of internal character logic was warped for the sake of plot or love interest situations. Not a fan! It's somehow more frustrating than the miscommunication trope, and not in a good way! Small knit pick, but I hate how her name was pronounced Ice-lah. Like, if it's not gonna be pronounced like Isla, just spell it differently. Eisla. There. Fixed it!The love interests. I have nothing else to say other than Grim is Rhysand from ACOTAR and Oro is Prince Maxon from the Selection if he was OP and had hella magic. That perfectly encapsulates both how their written and the extent of their dynamics. It's so reminiscent of ~other stuff~ it's difficult to see them as their own established characters, especially Grim. They're both like 500 years old and have a rivalry.I don't know who finds the 500 year man and 18 year old girl romance appealing, but I'm so tired of it. It's laughable. Even if they look 20... seriously? Every time I remember the character's ages, and how they actually act in the book, I have to laugh. Even just the fact that she beats them both in combat. It's like... okay. Both of these men led their armies in a war against each other 500 years ago and have been practicing fighting since and they just got their asses beat by an 18 year old. She wasn't even doing anything new that they haven't seen or her puting her own spin on it. She just beat them. Funny. I know it's YA and the main character needs some quality that gives her worth like that, but it's just so jarring. Grim's dialogue is attrocious. I can't even tell if the other dialogue in the book is alright, or if it just looks fine next to whatever comes out of his mouth.Pacing of this thing was excruciating. It slows down a lot at the 30% mark, and doesn't pick up again until the 70% mark. Basically, the second act is a slog. Once you reach the midpoint, it feels like it should be the break into the third act, but it's not. A lot of this felt like filler. Aster could've combined scenes easily. The trials were boring to read, and felt like there were no real stakes or reasoning behind them. They were there to give structure to the book. I don't get why the centennial was pitched as a competitive game. All realms but one benefit from the curse being broken, so why would they all compete against each other so insularly? Realistically, yes, they would've competed but it would be more political intregue, alliances and whispering behind doors, and less of whatever this is... the Selection trying to be sold as the Hunger Games. Now, the plot twist. This thing has been teased up and down. The plot twist! The plot twist! Does the plot twist make sense? Tecnically, after like 10 minutes of explanation, yeah. Is it good? ... No. I thought the plot twist would make us re-examine a lot of the relationships that the entire book spent cultivating. It would add new insight. It did play with our perception, but it felt really out of left field. A good plot twist adds nuance. This. This was not that. This book was so entrenched deeply in plot and love interests that it lost track of like... theme. And now the things that happen in the plot are meant to inform theme. How the plot twist should reflect on theme. Maybe I'm the dumb one here, but I just thought the twist was cheap.In the hands of a more competent author, this could've been an intriguing high fantasy. Maybe it could've been written in multiple POVs and really intereacted with its characters as rulers of dying kingdoms, and the character motivations that go along with it. I want to see what Cleo's secret was! I wanted to see how Azul faced his fears! I wanted to see how the world's consequences and the rulers' motivations interacted and intersected and led to unlikely alliances and power plays. Or, at the very least I wanted to see some cool action scenes. Even within the context of what it is, as a female-led YA book, I would've wanted... something new. Something different. Something other than another sheltered girl who's really good at fighting and falling in love. Lean into the fantasy, lean into what makes this book different. Because it just feels the same. At least define the atmosphere to be unique or noteworthy, because for all that convoluted worldbuilding, nothing feels new.MINOR SPOILERS//I saved this paragraph for last because it has to do with the plot twist, so if you're avoiding spoilers, look away. I won't say exactly what the twist was, but I will say by the end of it, there are no morally good female characters in the book besides the MC and a servant girl who gets two lines. And when I say not morally good, I mean they're like straight up evil. Backstabbing betrayal. Any betrayal or misstep by a man is handled with miles more nuance and forgiveness than anything a woman does in this book. The women's motivations are cartoonishly handled, and in the end, the ones responsible for the MC's plight. Very, very boring. Very tiring. Their decisions don't even foil the MC. It doesn't inform theme. It's. I don't know. It's just... in 2022? Really? We're doing this? I'm gonna have to add more stipulations to the Bechdel test because come on.I don't want to write a conclusion, so I won't. Thanks for the arc. My curiosity has been quenched. Tiktok will love this book. I can't imagine that it's translation to film will be good. I say that as a film reviewer who doubles as an avid reader. Things aren't looking good.EDIT 8/15/2022Dropping it to one star for visibility and also because I thought more about the plot twist and realized none of the actual actions lined up with the convoluted motivations.Also, for people who are critical of Aster as an industry plant, I highly suggest you read more about her sister, Daniella Pierson, and how she made a creative agency focusing on tiktok marketing called Newsland along with her newsletter. Industry plants do not exist in publishing, but money and connections do lend privilege, which is nothing new. This kind of success has happened before. Ernest Cline had a movie deal for Ready Player One before the book was out. Then again, both RPO and Lightlark are highly commercialized novels, which I do consider an issue when regarding the industry as a whole and what becomes popular.I recommend Ursula Le Guin’s essay titled “A Matter of Trust” from the Wave in the Mind if you are a young writer aspiring to become better at the craft and feel tempted by the appeal of quick commercial success. I’ll put it in front of every tiktok and twitter author if I have to lol. Eat your vegetables (serious, challenging novels that challenge you to think). Reading for entertainment is fine, but your writing will become so much better if you understand what makes great books great in a deeper sense, which necessitates a balanced diet. Trope marketing also plays into the increasing commercialization of novels, which Aster has utilized heavily, despite many of her tiktoks being misleading. False advertisement is not good marketing, which is why we’re now seeing a backlash. But also writing a highly commercial book is not a good book, because tropes are tools and not substance. Sell substance to readers. Anyways it’s very clear to me that Aster cares about writing and storytelling, but perhaps not as much the art or craft of it. To quote Billy Joel, slow down you crazy child, you’re so ambitious for a juvenile.I am unfortunately a bit of an aspiring writer myself (derogatory) and do not find my work to be anything good, or special. But making peace with this inspires me to be better, to work harder. I can take it, and I’m sure Aster can too. I have no doubt that Aster has worked hard, but her insistence on publishing this book even after her first agent dropped her for it and her claim that she does not suffer from imposter’s syndrome despite her massive premature success does lead me to believe that her writing is stunted from a lack of introspection. That isn’t to say she shouldn’t be proud of her work or achievements, but this entire mess is just reflective of an author who got way ahead of herself. Books are not as good as their marketing, their tropes, or anything else of that sort. They’re as good as the author makes it. Brandon Sanderson said (roughly from his BYU lectures), don’t focus on writing a good book, but becoming the kind of author capable of writing a good book. Which is what Aster has been working on, but if Lightlark is any reflection of her progress, she has a ways to go.",1.0

Il tutto è reso ancora più divertente dalle azioni persecutrici di Erin Doom nei confronti di chi OSA criticare questo ammasso di paroloni buttati insieme e dal suo passato (di cui sono tristemente a conoscenza) fatto di intimidazioni e minacce legali (perché ricordo che è laureata in giurisprudenza) rivolte a chi su Wattpad osava avere qualche elemento vagamente simile ai suoi nella propria storia. Imbarazzante. Velo pietoso. ————————————————————————edit #1: rating cambiato da tre stelle a una.1⭐️Questo libro é la prova palese di come le autrici italiane debbano ricevere un ordine restrittivo nei confronti del bully romance. Se non lo sapete scrivere, non scrivetelo. TW: menzione di abusi fisici e sessuali Non è il primo libro che leggo dell’autrice, e anzi ho addirittura seguito gli aggiornamenti capitolo per capitolo da quando su Wattpad esisteva solo la trama. La conclusione? Il libro che meritava di uscire in libreria era decisamente il primo, non questo. Questo, sembra un ammasso di scene discutibili scritte in modo troppo arzigogolato che punta a essere un retelling di cappuccetto rosso e che fallisce malamente. L’altro era un bel libro, per gli standard di Wattpad. Andiamo per ordine. I protagonisti:Abbiamo Nica, la classica santarellina amante di flora e fauna che giustifica il suo essere una totale inetta con il suo passato da bambina abusata in orfanotrofio. Se vi sembra che la mia descrizione sia insensibile é perché insensibile é il modo in cui questo libro mi ha fatto sentire. Gli abusi sui bambini vengono trattati frettolosamente, sono molto confusi e sembrano semplicemente un modo per dare una parvenza di sfondo alle personalità dei due protagonisti. (Ovviamente sono grumpy boy/sunshine girl, se non si fosse capito). Seguire il punto di vista di Nica é stato snervante perché si tratta di una bambina di cinque anni nel corpo di una diciassettenne. I suoi unici interessi sono i cerotti che ha alle dita, gli insetti nel giardino di casa e gli occhi neri del fratellastro.Poi abbiamo Rigel, un mezzo stalker ossessionato che grazie a due note sul pianoforte riesce a farsi adottare con Nica. Questo ragazzo si può descrivere semplicemente come uno psicopatico. Non c’é un altro modo per parlarne perché il suo unico pensiero é la protagonista e per il resto la sua testa é vuota. Il suo unico tratto distintivo é saper suonare il pianoforte e essere bono come la luna le stelle e il firmamento, ah e giustificare la sua psicosi con una malattia rarissima al cervello. Se questa follia vi suona famigliare é perché l’abbiamo ritrovata in “The Villain” della Shen, con Cillian che teneva a bada le emozioni per tenere a bada la tourette. (Evidentemente é una cosa che tra le scrittrici di NA va di moda? Non saprei.) I personaggi secondari: Sono in tutto sette. In ordine abbiamo, i genitori adottivi (inutili), due saffiche (inutili), la bitch della scuola (inutile), il terzo lato del triangolo che si rivela un abuser (inutile, perché ancora una volta gli abusi vengono usati come escamotage per mandare avanti il romance), l’amica dell’orfanotrofio che fa diventare il triangolo un quadrato (inutile ma accettabile, perché é l’unico personaggio che in questo libro si sopporta.) - Sui genitori non ho molto da dire, sono pressoché assenti e quando ci sono servono a fare battute tristi e a cucinare o vendere fiori. - La bitch della scuola, di cui ho totalmente rimosso il nome, c’è per due capitoli e serve a far suonare nella testa di Nica i campanelli d’allarme della gelosia. - Le uniche due amiche che Nica si fa sono due saffiche la cui storia viene buttata in mezzo al libro per circa due capitoli buoni e poi abbandonata. Una é innamorata ma non ha fatto coming out e l’altra non ha capito niente; purtroppo questa pseudo inclusivitá fa da contorno del contorno. Il tutto si risolve in pochissimi capitoli con nessun tipo di sensibilità sull’argomento. - L’amica dell’orfanotrofio, Adeline, è l’unico personaggio sopportabile. Il suo unico scopo é mettere un po’ di zizzania facendoci credere che sarà un problema tra i protagonisti ma per il resto é innocua. Oltre a questo serve a mandare minimamente avanti la trama rivelando finalmente che qualcuno dei bambini in orfanotrofio ha cantato sugli abusi. - Il ragazzo che prova ad abusare di Nica si chiama Leonard (o Leopold?), e devo dire che per quanto l’autrice abbia provato a farcelo detestare non é tanto peggio di Rigel. Anche lui la pedina, anche lui le fa cose che lei non ha chiesto. (vedi: il protagonista che le entra in camera e le fa dei succhiotti mentre dorme. é normale? no. mi interessa che sia il protagonista? NO.) L’ambientazione: É inutile. Questo libro é ambientato in Michigan ma la storia potrebbe anche svolgersi in pianura padana per la qualità delle descrizioni. Sappiamo che c’è un fiume (quale? boh), due case, una scuola e un ponte da cui i protagonisti cadono, FINE. Il che mi ha stupito, perché nel libro che Matilde (l’autrice usa uno pseudonimo) ha scritto prima, le descrizioni del Canada erano non male, seppur prolisse come al suo solito.Tra l’altro sembra una storia completamente fuori dal mondo. I personaggi si comportano come sociopatici e pur avendo due genitori adottivi che lavorano stabilmente ricevono come telefoni dei modelli con I TASTI? Evidentemente non bastavano le lucertole ma servivano i telefoni del paleolitico per far sembrare Nica ancora più piccola fiammiferaia. Niente sembra realistico, partendo dai pensieri dei protagonisti, passando alle ambientazioni, al modo in cui tutti i personaggi dialogano. (I dialoghi sono la parte peggiore, ma in generale lo stile di scrittura é cosí artificioso che viene da pensare che l’autrice si sia mangiata un libro di poesie discutibili e le abbia vomitate in prosa.) In generale? Questo libro non ha né capo né coda e mi viene da supporre che sia finita così perché l’autrice aveva un po’ troppe pretese che si sono risolte male. La trama é sconnessa e vuota fino agli ultimi capitoli (anche questi discutibili) il libro in sé voleva essere un po’ vago e misterioso, un po’ un bully romance in stile Penelope Douglas e un po’ rifarsi alle favole.SPOILER Il risultato é un mattone infinito senza una storia portante (ma prima di pubblicarlo lo ha letto un editor?) che si compone di episodi sconnessi e discutibili quali: il protagonista che la bullizza ammazzandole delle farfalle davanti e tirandole i codini a sette anni, il protagonista che picchia chi le parla, il protagonista che le fa i succhiotti mentre lei é ignara, il protagonista che le sussurra all’orecchio al buio da dietro, loro che entrano in bagno quando l’altro si sta facendo la doccia, loro che cadono da un burrone insieme e lui che sconfigge il coma (pur avendo una malattia cerebrale rarissima) perché lei andava lí a leggergli le favole. Il tutto condito con questi accenni agli abusi che i bambini ricevevano in orfanotrofio e che servono a questa storia come la maionese nell’insalata di riso. Onestamente rivorrei davvero il tempo che ci ho sprecato indietro.",1.0
192,Fairy Tale,"Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for their world or ours.",4.11,"['September', '6,', '2022']","2 stars for a Stephen King book. Yeah, I know. This lackluster rating certainly hurts me more than it hurts King. Death, taxes and King’s storytelling skills are what are supposed to be life’s certainties, right? But — I knew I was in trouble when at 82% I was sure that I could put this book down and not care at all what happens in the end - even though I quite liked the first 1/3 of the story. And it’s not because this book is terrible - although King wrote a few real stinkers throughout his long prolific career, this isn’t quite one of them. It’s just that it left me not even as much bored as quite indifferent, and that’s a cardinal sin for a book.
 “Stories. An endless number of stories that pour into the funnel and come out in our world, barely changed.”
It feels like two books tacked together. The one I liked: a slice-of-life story about a teen boy who befriends a dying old man and his dog and sacrifices his last year of high school to become a caretaker. And the one that did not click with me: a story of a bland teen boy inheriting a passage to a version of fairyland where evil has taken a firm hold. The magic here fizzles out the moment magic world takes center stage.Conclusion: If you want to read a Stephen King book about a boy in a twisted version of Fairyland, read The Talisman instead. 
“In some ways those were good months. I felt useful, needed. I liked myself better than I had in a long time. Only the end was terrible.” If you are new to King, don’t start here. King’s forte is his supernaturally good storytelling skills and a great ear for dialogue, as well as his uncanny ability to take the most mundane things and make them both magical and unsettling. But what we get here instead is an adequate serviceable story that never rises above just that: a promising intro that leads into a fairly generic dark fantasy adventure of the Chosen One - Emerald City, commoners worshipping royalty, a lovely princess, undead henchmen and a Lovecraftian Big Baddie anticlimactically defeated. And no, it doesn’t turn into something better in the end. It does exactly what it says on a tin: it gives you a fairytale adventure, and not a shred more, and then just fizzles out. A lot of buildup and foreshadowing that led exactly nowhere, with no payoff and little below the surface. And the overall feel is that of a Young Adult novel that’s trying to be edgy.(Maybe I shouldn’t have been reading this in parallel with what I consider King’s best - the still amazing after a gagillion rereads It).It seems that King’s hook for readers this time is an adorable old dog. If you are a pet person, the one who’d seriously consider risking their life for the sake of a pet, he’s got your attention for a good chunk of this story. But, well, maybe the issue is that I’m more of a pet rock person, and that I need more than a lovely old dog to make me care.
 “Sure,’ Bertie said. ‘Monster dog. Like Cujo in that movie. Riii-ight.”



From a different author it would have been a decent effort, although still nothing special. But I know what King can do with books, and this makes Fairy Tale even more lackluster than it would have been had I been a newcomer to his ouvre. That’s one of the few times when those 600 pages actually felt much too long.2 stars. I’m still King’s Constant Reader and devoted fan, but this mediocre book is easily forgettable.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0
193,This is How You Lose the Time War,,3.91,"['July', '16,', '2019']","‘I want to be a context for you, and you for me.’There is something uniquely affecting when love is painted against the backdrop of the limitlessness of space and time. The effect has been done many times over but nothing can prepare you for the extraordinary beauty in which This is How You Lose the Time War allows you to experience love stretching out and weaving across time and dimensions to examine just how infinite it can possibly be. A spark of emotion that shines through galaxies reduced to dust, the countless rises and falls of mortal empires, the lifespans of all human feats and follies. Co-written by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, each writing one of the two protagonists, the novel is a soaring epistalatory sapphic romance between two rival time-traveling agents in a war between their respective societies to control and rewrite the multiverse in order to eradicate the other. Spawn by a private battlefield provocation, the two agents become caught in a maelstrom of self-discovery and romance corresponding by letters as they chase each other across time and space in a playful and imaginative novel so searingly beautiful the cosmos can barely contain it.These two authors have created something charmingly original in Time War, enhanced by the distinct dueling voices of the authors as their prose communicates and responds to each other along with their characters. Many of these letters, particularly in the novel’s latter half, blossom into pure ethereal poetry. On occasion it dips into purple prose, as one letter admits, however, what a clever sentiment for a profession of love between characters named Red and Blue to evolve into purple. The writing remains crisp, rotating between short narration and the correspondence between the two, allowing the narrative to progress as strongly on wings of emotion as it does the chain of events. What transpires is often intentionally vague as no time is wasted on much exposition or explanation, but fully immerses you in a world you won’t quite grasp or understand. It’s as if this gorgeous landscape of the multiverse were simply a blur as you are focused on the interaction between Red and Blue, much the way the world around you fades from focus in the first moments of love.Ultimately, any attempt at concreteness in a universe in a constant state of flux and revision would be beside the point, and the vagueness reflects that. It is only though the shared connection between Red and Blue that we can find a stable focal point as they pass through a kaleidoscope of time. Much like the way the pair gives context to one another, our only context is through them as well. They are each other’s only tether to stability in an unstable reality.‘When did it happen? Or has it always happened? Like your victory, love spreads back through time.’Entire multi-dimensions are shifted, burned or woven together on the battlefield of time between Garden, an organic and collectivist society from which Blue has grown, and Agency, a post-singularity mechanical society that created Red. They are locked in an eternal time-war of which the specifics and origins of are rarely addressed and even then are quite vague. The novel makes reference to Romeo and Juliet in narrative and thematically (the play, it is said, has different endings in each strand of time), and shares it’s notion of a long-standing feud where all existing players have forgotten why but continue to play it out to the point of extreme violence. What they are doing exactly is a bit elusive but strands are altered by, say, helping a city build a port or ensuring a mathematical formula survives the destruction of Atlantis: little things that add up over centuries to create wholly different versions of reality that are fought over.‘In the war they wage through time, what lasting advantage comes from murdering ghosts, who, with a slight shift of threads, will return to life or live different lives that never bright them to the executioner’s blade?...No death sticks but the one that matters.’ ‘What a microcosm we are of the war as a whole, you and I,’ Blue writes to Red early on, ‘An action and an equal and opposite reaction.’ The two women--they identify as she/her and can take on human form though you’d be hard pressed to form a definite image of what they look like based on the various hints--who’s designation as Red and Blue help to impress an idea as mere players in a game, are equals of one another, rivals ever, which is the initial attraction between the them. ‘They were separate, they did not speak, but each shaped the other, even as they were shaped in turn.’ What begins as a game of hunter and hunted in boasting and taunting letters quickly gives way to deep conversations about the self that makes them aware they have an agency beyond their respective Agencies and despite being weapons of war have a taste for the finer and beautiful things in life. In those moments they realize there is a hole inside them that only the other can fill. And as their love grows, they begin to wonder--partly due to the millenia of time they criss-cross during their budding attraction--if perhaps the love didn’t just arrive but had always been there. As with any sci-fi involving time travel, there is the inevitable paradox of events and free-will within a shifting reality and the two authors harness this paradox into their novel towards an exquisite and emotional end.‘There’s a kind of time travel in letters, isn’t there?’‘Letters are structures, not events,’ Red writes to Blue, ‘Yours give me a place to live inside.’ This beautiful refuge from war they’ve found in their secret correspondence also becomes a commentary on language and communication itself. In whimsical sci-fi nature, they write in abstract languages found in reading the structure of leaves on a plant or decoding rings on a tree (just let it happen, it’s super cool), which reflects the way the tools of writing shape how we write--a topic often written upon by philosopher Jacques Derrida. Their secret letters envelope the secrecy of their relationship and dangers they face even reading letters from the enemy, which is fascinating to think of considering a digital age where communication can occur through images (entire conversations can be had with emojis and memes) or other non-alphabetic communication. In our modern world we continue to embrace non-verbal communication that relationships can be built from, such as how with online dating many people exist only in messages to one another before meeting and form an attraction that way. It is a beautiful notion to consider how through just our words we can fall in love with the essence of another by showing an understanding, empathy and passion for the thoughts of each other (when I first met my partner we met in person only three times before she moved back to Ireland so for months we got to know each other through long late night texting and her sending me letters, so love across distance has always spoken to me pretty well). Messages written at one place in time, sent, and received in another transmitting emotions across time and space. ‘Books are letters in bottles,’ one letter reads, ‘cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.’ All books are love letters, if you think about it. One person sending out a message in hopes someone will understand and understand them in turn, an abstract connection that reaches even beyond the grave. There is a voyeuristic sense to this novel--reading their letters and all--but it reminds us of our primal instincts that desire connection and the fireworks of emotion that come from first contact with it. It is nearly impossible to not be swept up in their romance and feel their fears, pains, and needs standing naked and unafraid before one another, like a tree in winter unashamed of it’s gnarled limbs. ‘Love is what we have, against time and death, against all the powers ranged to crush us down.’There is a subtle shadow of dread cast across their saga keeping the reader keenly aware that their taboo relationship is always threatened by the larger world in which they exist. Agency traces Blue’s exploits and wishes to set a trap for her, one Red will be used to ensure the success of the mission. Betrayal exists in the peripheries of this novel at all times, especially when they begin to open up hoping this isn’t just some long con. Poison is an important theme throughout the novel, with the women taunting each other that any letter could be laced with it and choosing to read forward anyways. It reminds us of how we remove our armor and open ourselves up to pain when we choose to love. War begets death and suffering, and the two players have entered into this affair knowing the risks but plunging on ahead regardless. ‘I want to meet you in every place I have loved.’It is difficult to say much more without spoiling anything in this clever plotted novel. It is one that encourages an immediate reread, as clues and puzzle pieces are weaved into the novel much like the way our heroines weave space and time together for their purposes. It is an extraordinary little book that somehow manages to never feel like a gimmick despite it’s inventive and quirky nature. Time, place, love, and war all become a potent concoction for one of the most tender and vulnerable romances I’ve ever read. I could praise it all day long but, as is written in one of the cosmic letters, ‘I am the songbird running out of air, and I must breathe.’4.5/5‘I want to be a body for you. I want to chase you, find you, I want to be eluded and teased and adored; I want to be defeated and victorious—I want you to cut me, sharpen me. I want to drink tea beside you in ten years or a thousand. Flowers grow far away on a planet they’ll call Cephalus, and these flowers bloom once a century, when the living star and its black-hole binary enter conjunction.I want to fix you a bouquet of them, gathered across eight hundred thousand years, so you can draw our whole engagement in a single breath, all the ages we’ve shaped together.’",5.0
194,Tress of the Emerald Sea,,4.43,"['January', '10,', '2023']","4.5/5 starsTress of the Emerald Sea was simply whimsical and wonderful. Starting the year 2023 with the first secret novel from The Year of Sanderson is the correct action for me.
“Even small actions have consequences. And while we can often choose our actions, we rarely get to choose our consequences.”
The time is here. The first of the four awaited secret project novels, Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson is here. If you're active in the fantasy community, or even if you're not, it is no longer news that Sanderson has shocked the world with the immense success of his four secret novels Kickstarter campaign. I mean, number one most pledged Kickstarter campaign of all time; it doesn’t get more successful than that. And it shouldn’t also come as a shock that I, as a longtime fan of his Cosmere novels, end up enjoying Tress of the Emerald Sea. I wanted to start my year with a great book, and choosing this book as the first novel of 2023 (as I said) was the right pick. Sanderson plus a full-length Cosmere novel is a formula that never ceases to impress me. What I did not expect, however, was just how visually beautiful Tress of the Emerald Sea would be. I am pleasantly surprised. I am glad the past Petrik decided to buy four premium hardcover editions of the secret novels, and I am eternally thankful to my co-blogger, TS, for covering the expense of the shipping fee. Without TS, I do not think I would cave into buying the premium hardcover editions, and I would regret it so much. I will go into more details on this later, but at $40 per secret novel (not counting the shipping fee) and for everything we get, this special edition can be considered, relatively, a bargain. This is on top of it being such a fun and cozy book to read.
“Leaving didn’t feel exciting. It felt heavy. Every child looked forward to the day when they could choose a different path from the one their parents were on. Tress sincerely hoped she hadn’t decided on one that led straight off a cliff.”
All her life on an island named The Rock in the emerald-green ocean, Tress lived a simple life with the simple pleasures of collecting cups received from sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend, Charlie. But when Charlie’s father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must leave her simple life to stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Although I expected to love this book, I was initially worried after reading the first few chapters. Note the word ship in the official premise. Sailing and seafaring dominated the majority of Tress of the Emerald Sea. Personally, I tend to have mixed feelings about fantasy books with a heavy focus on seafaring unless they're The Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb and The Tide Child trilogy by R.J. Barker. And there were indeed some sections here where I felt a bit of a lull because of this. However, my overall experience was fun. Most of the time, it was difficult for me to stay away from the book. Sanderson's prose and the relatively short length of the novel, plus its short chapters, made it easy for me to steal-read one or two chapters whenever I had some free time. This was a delightful book about human beings, contradictions, leadership, found family, stories, love, bravery, and empathy.
“It might seem that the person who can feel for others is doomed in life. Isn’t one person’s pain enough? Why must a person like Tress feel for two, or more? Yet I’ve found that the people who are the happiest are the ones who learn best how to feel. It takes practice, you know. Effort. And those who (late in life) have been feeling for two, three, or a thousand different people… well, turns out they’ve had a leg up on everyone else all along. Empathy is an emotional loss leader. It pays for itself eventually.”
Before reading Tress of the Emerald Sea, I did not read any of the secret novel preview chapters. However, based on the known artists and the title or premise of the four novels, Tress of the Emerald ranked third out of four. I am interested in all four, but I am most excited about the third and fourth secret novels. Based on these, the first two secret novels felt like they would be the most tonally different from Sanderson's other Cosmere books. Having read all published Cosmere stories, including this one, I can convey that Tress of the Emerald Sea has proved it. Sanderson has mentioned that The Princess Bride is one of the main inspirations behind this book. Another good comparison for what kind of tone you're getting here is Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman. So it is time to admit something. I haven't read or watched The Princess Bride yet, but I have watched Good Omens. And I think Sanderson nailed the comparison he's going for. The storytelling is whimsical and light-hearted in tone but also imbued with clever philosophical nuggets and serious themes occasionally. I loved the novel for it. I don't think I would've liked it this much if it was just all fun and joy all the way through. Sanderson's comedy, especially when the narrative involves young adult characters, doesn't land well with me often. But his hard-hitting and thought-provoking passages? That's another story. Sanderson may not have flowery prose, but the words he put on the pages of his novel frequently hit and became passages I think about daily. A few examples from this book are:
“While a healthy measure of foolhardiness drove our ancestors toward discovery, fear kept them alive. If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.”
And also these two long passages about memories.
“Beyond that, memories have a way of changing on us. Souring or sweetening over time— like a brew we drink, then recreate later by taste, only getting the ingredients mostly right. You can’t taste a memory without tainting it with who you have become. That inspires me. We each make our own lore, our own legends, every day. Our memories are our ballads, and if we tweak them a little with every performance… well, that’s all in the name of good drama.”

“Memory is often our only connection to who we used to be. Memories are fossils, the bones left by dead versions of ourselves. More potently, our minds are a hungry audience, craving only the peaks and valleys of experience. The bland erodes, leaving behind the distinctive bits to be remembered again and again. Painful or passionate, surreal or sublime, we cherish those little rocks of peak experience, polishing them with the ever-smoothing touch of recycled proxy living. In so doing— like pagans praying to a sculpted mud figure— we make of our memories the gods which judge our current lives. I love this. Memory may not be the heart of what makes us human, but it’s at least a vital organ. Nevertheless, we must take care not to let the bliss of the present fade when compared to supposedly better days. We’re happy, sure, but were we more happy then? If we let it, memory can make shadows of the now, as nothing can match the buttressed legends of our past… Do not let memory chase you. Take the advice of one who has dissected the beast, then rebuilt it with a more fearsome face— which I then used to charm a few extra coins out of an inebriated audience. Enjoy memories, yes, but don’t be a slave to who you wish you once had been. Those memories aren’t alive. You are.”
Although possible, it wouldn't feel organic to have these kinds of passages appearing throughout the book if the novel is told through the first-person or third-person perspective of Tress. These were effective because the entire story in Tress of the Emerald Sea is narrated through Hoid's perspective. Hoid is an integral character in Sanderson's Cosmere universe. And we, Cosmere fans, are all waiting for Hoid's origin story. Sanderson mentioned he wanted to practice and be more fluent at writing Hoid's perspective before that backstory novel happened, and this is the book where it came to fruition. This won't, however, be how the story is told eventually in Hoid's backstory novel. It will definitely be less whimsical. But to give you an idea of the kind of voice Sanderson is giving Hoid in this book, if you've read The Stormlight Archive series, this is more in tune with the unforgettable ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon"" stories Hoid told in the series. A full-length version of that kind of in-world story. I absolutely loved ""Wandersail"" and ""The Dog and the Dragon,"" and obviously, I ended up loving Tress of the Emerald Sea as well.
“Worldbringers like myself spend decades combing through folk tales, legends, myths, histories, and drunken bar songs looking for the most unique stories. We hunt for bravery, cleverness, heroism. And we find no shortage of such virtues. Legends are silly with them. But the person who is willing to reconsider their assumptions? The hero who can sit down and reevaluate their life? Well, now that is a gemstone that truly glitters, friend.”
So yes, we get to learn more about Hoid and the Cosmere (more on this in the next paragraph) inside this book. But at the end of the day, even though this is told through Hoid's perspective, Tress of the Emerald Sea is still a standalone story about Tress and her adventures. I mentioned The Stormlight Archive earlier, and I am no stranger to voicing how much I love the Bridge Four group in the series. The found family trope is one of the many things Sanderson executed extremely well in The Stormlight Archive and the first Mistborn trilogy. And he managed to craft another cherishable found family in this book. Tress, Huck, Fort, Salay, and all the characters are well-written and likable characters. The Deaf character representation was written with the help of a special sensitivity reader to do it justice, too. And hey, for the first time in the Cosmere, we finally get to see a real dragon. As Tress and the crew of the ship she's in face danger constantly, the bonds between them grow deeper and deeper. My investment in them, too. And upon reaching the last page, I can't help but hope we will get more stories or appearances from these characters eventually. Knowing how connected with each other the Cosmere is now, I'm confident we will.
“She… didn’t need to do this all on her own. That shouldn’t have been such a revelation for her. But after spending ages walking around with everyone piling bricks in your arms, it can throw you off balance when someone removes a brick to carry for you.”
Speaking of Cosmere connections, and because people will ask me this question, should you read other Cosmere books first? Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story in the world of Lumar. This marks the first time we get a book taking place in this world in the Cosmere. Like always, it is not necessary to read the other Cosmere books first to enjoy the main story here. But will you benefit from reading them? Yes, you will. I talk about this already in my review of The Lost Metal. But moving forward, Sanderson's future publications in the Cosmere universe, especially the ones taking place after book 5 of The Stormlight Archive, will most likely have heavy Cosmere crossovers. If you intend to read all of Sanderson's Cosmere books, it is a good idea to start catching up reading them if you want to reap all the connections. As for this book, reading the entirety of The Mistborn Saga so far will be beneficial. Additionally, there were a few small nods to the magic or technology portrayed in Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Stormlight Archive. I will leave it to you to decide whether you want to read them first or not. There is no spoiler for these three series. Also, although not the primary planet of the magic and there is no main novel for it yet, aethers and its explosive potential are explored here.
“Now, most people would agree that humans are not telepathic. We can’t directly send our thoughts or emotions into the minds of others. Nevertheless, you can hear my story and imagine the things I describe—the same as I picture them in my own mind. What is that, if not a form of telepathy?”
One more thing before I end this review. I will update this once I have the physical copy, but right now, even the ebook of the premium edition alone is exquisitely made. Unless the paper quality of the physical copy sucks, which is so doubtful, I can vouch that the $40 I spent on getting this book is well spent. Maybe too well spent. It is almost ridiculous. You won’t get a premium/special edition like this with only $40 anywhere else. If Subterranean Press or Grim Oak Press publishes a book like this, I guarantee it will cost at least $200 (not counting the shipping fee and customs fee yet). The stunning design and the more than ten interior artworks (four fully colored art and the rest in green-toned black and white) by Howard Lyon enhanced the quality of the aesthetic and the tale. They are magnificent. And I am brimming with excitement waiting for the physical copy to arrive at my place. And if the first secret novel already reaches this level of production value, I want to read and find out what the other three will look like. Rest assured, in this review, I leave out some surprises in the clever design and artwork inside this book for you to find out for yourself.
“One of the great tragedies of life is knowing how many people in the world are made to soar, paint, sing, or steer— except they never get the chance to find out.”
Whether aesthetically or narrative-wise, Tress of the Emerald Sea provided a whimsical and wonderful reading experience. It is a refreshing addition to the Cosmere universe. And it is essentially (at least, it read like one) a Cosmere version of an adult fairy tale. With the success of the secret projects, some readers might think Sanderson favors quantity instead of quality in his books recently. It is up to you to think that way, but I can't voice the same sentiment. Personally speaking, Tress of the Emerald Sea doesn't show any drop in storytelling quality. Every book in the Cosmere, including this that he wrote in secret, works amazingly well for me. Similarly to the first Mistborn trilogy, even though this is undoubtedly a different kind of book, I think Tress of the Emerald Sea is a standalone story that can be enjoyed by both YA or adult fantasy readers. Making this even more appealing to a bigger audience. This is a superb first book of 2023 for me, and I hope this signals the positive trajectory of my reading year. I look forward to receiving the physical copy and reading the next secret novel.
“The first is that heroes can be trained. Not by a government or a military, but by the people themselves. Heroes are the ones who have thought about what they’re going to do, and who have trained to do it. Heroism is often the seemingly spontaneous result of a lifetime of preparation… In the frenzied anarchy of destruction, loyalty to causes and kingdoms alike tends to fall to the chaos. But the bond between people, well, that’s stronger than steel. If you want to create heroes, don’t give them something to fight for. Give them someone to fight for.”

""Hate that was so bright and hot that it was the first thing that truly warmed him.""


How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories is an illustrated novella following Cardan Greenbriar, during many different stages in his life, while we slowly see all the different things that shaped him cruelly. The sound that left me when I opened this book and realized we were going to get present day with Jude from Cardan’s POV… be still, my hopes and dreams and heart.Rovina Cai’s art is truly so beautiful that it renders me speechless. I was already in love with her and her art because of her work with 
The Wayward Children
 series, but this entire book feels like am immersive work of art. From the perfect color palette, to the most perfect details, she executes the vibe of Cardan and his story in a way that I don’t think another artist could.In this story, Cardan’s life is very much impacted by a troll named Aslong who was wronged by Cardan’s father. She tells a story about a boy with a heart of stone, who finds himself in a predicament with a monster girl who won’t scare him away, until his heart starts beating again. And then all throughout his life, she tells his alternate versions of this same story, each version with a new meaning for a new version of Cardan himself.


""She was the only real thing in a land of ghosts.""


We also get to see so much of Cardan’s perspective during 
The Cruel Prince
, much like we did with Tarryn in 
The Lost Sisters
, and it was everything. Nicasia and Locke have much wanted character development in this book, too, and I am literally on my knees begging for Holly to just give us the trilogy in Cardan’s complete point of view. But we see Nicasia being fostered on the land because her mother, Orlagh, Queen of the Undersea, wants to start putting pieces in motion. We get to see Locke, and his empty house and even emptier heart, teach Cardan the word “cruel” on every page. And these two, in addition to a prophecy looming over this young prince, are truly the first catalysts to this story and I was so in love seeing behind the scenes. And when Holly gives us Locke’s perspective one of these years…


""Playing the villain was the only thing he’d ever really excelled at.""


Each part, each mini story, we get to see Cardan questioning who he is and who he wants to be. Not to make this too deep, but Cardan very slowly realizes that he is not responsible for the terrible acts his family committed; both to him and to the people they ruled over. He struggles with his identity of a prince who should feel like he has everything, and a boy who feels like he has nothing. But seeing him finally understand that he deserves not only love but unconditional love? Him slowly appreciating that his heart can be warm and beat unapologetically? Truly some powerful stuff.On a personal note, I think most of you know that Holly Black is an author who means a lot to me. Her fae stories are what first got me into YA when I was young, and it really changed me as a reader and probably a human as well. I know most of you know that 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and everything, very much including my reading, so being able to curl up and read about my emotional support fae, from my emotional support author, just meant a lot to me. I truly think reading this book a day before release (bless you Waterstones and my mail person) was the best reading experience I’ve had all year, and for that alone this book was probably the easiest five star I’ve given in a year of not a lot of five star reads.


""Feels as though she has to earn the crown on her head over and over again.""


Overall, this felt like the fairytale of my dreams. Cardan is my favorite character in 
The Cruel Prince
 series (or any of Holly’s books, I think) and this truly was such a magical, wonderous, unforgettable addition to this world. I am incredibly biased over this series because so much of my heart and nostalgia are wrapped up within this world, but I honestly think there is just so much to love on every page of this book. I feel blessed to read about each time Holly gives us a new book, and this will for sure be a favorite of mine for all of 2020. Lastly, I cannot believe we really got to read about Cardan going out for boba.Content & Trigger Warnings: abandonment, bullying, abuse, mention of drug use, humiliation, talk of cheating, and a lot of drinking.

I've had a pretty tough week, and boy was it perfect timing to be able to go on an adventure with Percy Jackson again. He was my very first best friend, and the comfort I felt turning every page of this will not be forgotten. Even if it feels like Rick will never leave me alone, his words will always be something I pine after. He knows how to drive a story home!Every page of this felt like a throwback to a core memory we built together as a group of kids just wanting to go on an adventure. All of Percy's greatest hits lay before us so we could reminisce, and be reminded what it felt like to be a kid again. We're all grown up, and while Percy is still a teenager, he grew up with us, too. He's always had the sarcasm of his age and the courage to never actually act that way. With a Mom like Sally, how could he ever be anything but wise beyond his years? With Annabeth by his side, is it truly possible to be anything but special?He's never really been given a break to be a kid. Being a half blood doesn't allow you the luxury. I'm almost thankful for it after reading this book simply because he learned so much faster than anyone else that growing up is the most important thing you can do in your life. Loving people, getting to live life beside them, that's the point.Percy doesn't need anyone else to point that out for him, he knew it when the Gods gifted him immortality and he said no. But this book was a nice reminder that no matter what he does in his life, no matter how many monsters he must fight, the goal will always be to keep going with Annabeth and Grover. How sweet is that?How did he grow up so fast? How is he going to be a big brother (we knew that). How on earth is he smarter, more caring, more understanding that anyone has ever given him credit for? I love that even when he's fighting monsters, he still tries to give them the benefit of the doubt and a chance. That he deals with Gods thousands of years old, and will always give them a chance to change their ways even when they absolutely do not deserve it.He's a golden drachma if I've ever known one. I can't wait to see where his next search for a college letter will take him.",5.0
198,The Brothers Hawthorne,"Four brothers. Two missions. One explosive read. Jennifer Lynn Barnes returns to the world of her #1 bestselling Inheritance Games trilogy, and the stakes have never been higher.",3.97,"['August', '29,', '2023']","Was this my most anticipated read of the year?  Heck yes.   Was I disappointed?  Extremely. Before I start this review I just want to make it clear I love this series and characters so much. I still recommend the first three books in the series. They are so worth investing your time in. This one? Not so much. It started off really well. The four brothers together, talking and bonding. I was really entertained for the first 60-70 pages and then it went downhill. The  pacing is slow. Firstly let me start by saying  Nash and Xander  are really vital and core members of this series and the lack of them makes an immense impact. Nash and Xander both provide a sense of unity, balance, family and peace into Grayson and Jameson's chaos. I missed the two so much in this one. It was a terrible mistake on JLB's part to kick the two out of the book. Secondly, the  dynamic between Grayson, Avery and Jameson  completely fell. The three act like they no longer know each other. There are so few scenes of the three together it's just strange. Grayson and Jameson deserved more scenes together. They are no longer rivals stuck in a love triangle. Coming to the  ""love aspect"".  Those who haven't read the series yet, might want to skip past these few sentences.   Jameson and Avery were so amazing in the last book together. They had such good growth and Jameson was shining. Here, they had zero chemistry. Sure, they had like two good scenes together but the rest of the book they act like they are strangers? It is so weird. Grayson and Avery still have better chemistry. It hurts to see my man is still hung up on her. There clearly lies more in store for  Grayson.  His story is not complete and this was the sole reason for this book. But while doing so, am not sure what JLB was trying to achieve. He is broken. Hung up over so many girls who betrayed him so many times. He stood up to Eve towards the end and opened up to his brothers but his character needs more. There was no healing for him. Hopefully that gets rectified in the next book.  A major problem was the fact that JLB wrote the story in a very confusing manner.  We get Grayson and Jameson's POV. Both have missions of their own. Jameson's mission in particular served no major purpose. His character deserves better than that. Apart from two different missions, we get flashbacks in between which just makes things worse. The back and forth along with different pov started to make things unnecessarily complicated. No doubt JLB is a talented writer but she made a lot of mistakes in this. The way  this book has not much to offer and is written in such a boring manner makes it comes across as written purely for the purpose of money grab.  This book easily could have been a novella, 200 pages short but it dragged on in a miserable way. It surely reads like a novella but is a proper book. The only reason I will read the next book is for the fact am not ready to give up on Grayson yet. ~•~•~LET'S GOOOO. Justice for my bae~.~.~Justice for Grayson Hawthorne or I sue.",2.0
199,The Institute,,4.20,"['September', '10,', '2019']","KING of the writers just released a book and I started my Single ladies/Staying alive combination happy dance, grabbed it into my hands and started my ritual I do when I start a new King book. My ritual is simple. I pray for several things starting with better eyesight (Dear King always like to write encyclopedic sized books which I also used in my training sessions. I lift “The Stand” and “Dark Tower series” 50 times till my arms turned into jellies but now I got an amazing look. Some people confused me with woman wrestlers! Damn it!) and my healthy soul (probably I sold to the devil because I’m biggest fan of his fantastic villains. Randal Flagg, Jack Torrence, George Stark, Blaine the Mono were my dream quadruple! I visualized them start villain poker tournaments!) and healthy throat and ears! ( I was 10 when I started to read my first king Book and I was at my school chorus practice, hiding my book in my music notes but instead of singing that day, I was reading and then I started screaming. I terrorized my friends and teachers that day! So I found my life mission already, thanks to Mr. King) As a summary, it is the toughest thing to start a new King book because he’s definitely my favorite writer. In 30 years, I left the country I was born, I cut drinking Coke ( because I moved to NYC and its Coke tastes the worst!), I stopped eating cakes instead of I addicted to Chardonnay and cupcakes! I got married and I resigned from my bank manager job to be screenplay writer (Yes! Everybody knows something is wrong with me!) after moving to L.A, learned fake smiling and not to scream when I see at a walking talking over tanned and botoxed Barbie doll. So many things changed, life molded me, tormented me, punched me but also gave so many gifts to me. But ONLY ONE THING in 30 years didn’t change: I resumed reading KING books and loved them wholeheartedly. So becoming objective and not putting your fingers on your keyboard to give gazillion FIVE SHINY STARS is one of the hardest test I have to pass!   Let's go back to talk about this book: in first few pages, I thought I started the wrong book because it seemed like Tim Jaimeson’s story, was ex officer at Sarasota and left his job, left his seat to a FBI agent, hitchhiking and found himself DuPray applying “Night Knocker” job. His story is hooked me up from the beginning. I thought I read another plot but that’s okay, I loved this story so much reminded me of old school King books.   But then next chapter, everything changed and we’re introduced to highly intelligent, gifted Luke’s story and his kidnapping. One night he found himself at the copied version his own room (but the copiers might have forgotten to add windows!) And the wonder kids of INSTITUTE story began!  I felt like somebody dragged Mr. King away from his keyboard while he’s writing this book and Duffer Brothers sat on his seat to create crueler version of Stranger Things with meaner adults and gifted but a little unlikable kids version. (I only resonated with Avery but he’s not Dustin!)  There are too many references to King’s older works on this book. Even the twins reminded you of Shining’s creepy twins Lisa and Louise Burns!) There are too kind of extraordinary kinds here: The kids who are telepaths or telekinetic! To differentiate them they have to find the ones seeing the dots! We don’t have Carrie White but Avery’s character was a little reminded us Danny Torrence who has its shining.  I missed his characters’ connections and growing friendship I’ve read on other books (his story “Body”, It, even at Dark Tower series was about different people’s connection) I found this one a little flat, dull, more artificial. And the vulgarity, harshness the kids endured and the illegal, ruthless test methods the institute crew applied on them DISTURBED me so much. I can handle the violence. I’m die-hard Tarantino fan but when it comes to innocent kids, this kind of torturing methods churned my stomach! ( I wish I could puke on all the villains of the book!) This time their methods put me on edge and I made a waterboarding list instead of slapping because other villains of the books seemed like Disney characters comparing with these nasty scumbags! Of course honor member of my hating list is starting with Mrs. Sigsby (what kind of last name is this?) and Tony! I think I should put all the crew members of institute including Maureen because snitches are always the worst!  As a summary: because of its longevity, it’s not a fast reading, but it’s still intriguing, you never got bored. It’s quite a page-turner, riveting, nerve bending, surprising book. Even though there are too many references of his older books, writing was a little different from King’s usual style and the things the little kids fought against made me sad and frustrated. So I decided to stick with shiny four stars! It’s still a remarkable, smart-written, good book but not one of the best works of KING OF WRITERS!Okay, now I started to FLOAT! I think Mr. King might feel I cut the last star! I wish I drank my last sip of Chardonnay before being punished. Well, all work no play make Nily dull person!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

202,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,,4.58,"['July', '8,', '1999']","I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0
203,The Hobbit,,4.29,"['September', '21,', '1937']","Some books are almost impossible to review. If a book is bad, how easily can we dwell on its flaws! But if the book is good, how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book? Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review, what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work? 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. There, see how simple that was? If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. At some level, there is little more to say. Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.But if it was only simple entertainment, I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book. Instead, this simple children's story resonates and fascinates. It teases and hints at something larger and grander, and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing, lecturing or being condescending.At its heart, the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in 'The Hobbit' when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told, but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof. How often has that idea fascinated me.Consider also how the story opens, with Bilbo's breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit, and Gandalf's continual meditation on the meaning of 'Good morning.’ How much insight is concealed within Gandalf's gentle humor! How often do we find ourselves, like Bilbo, saying something we don't really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning! How often do we find ourselves saying, ""I don't mean to be rude, but..."", when in fact we mean, ""I very much mean to be rude, and here it comes!"" If we did not mean to be rude, surely we wouldn't say what we say. Instead we mean, ""I'm going to be rude but I don't want you to think I'm someone who is normally rude..."", or ""I'm going to put myself forward, but I don't want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant..."", or even, ""I'm going to be rude, but I don't want to think of myself as someone who is rude, so I'm going to pretend I'm not being rude...""I think that is what makes this more than just a good book, but a great one. Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings, and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or self-loathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings. We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form, and we have for as long as we've had recorded literature. Our comic books are filled with those neo-pagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to, whatever else may be true of them, 'beats people up good'. These modern Ajaxs, Helens and Achilles dominate the box office, and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well. Oh sure, the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt, attract the opposite sex, and enforce their will upon others, but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility. How different is Tolkien's protagonist from Heracles, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman - short, small, mundane, and weak. Of all the principal characters of the story, he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute - martial prowess.And yet, he is not actually merely an 'average Joe'. Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles, it's just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isn't the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves. Bilbo is gentle. He is simple. He is humble. Power and wealth have little attraction for him. He is kind. He takes less than his share, and that that he takes he gives away. He is a peacemaker. Though wrongly imprisoned, he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him. Rather he apologizes for stealing food, and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took. Though mistreated, he harbors no enmity. He never puts himself forward, but he never shirks when others do. How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero, and yet how much better we would be if we did? How much better off would we be if we, like Thorin could declare in our hearts, ""There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."" How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things? What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to 'beat people up good'? What real use could we put it too? How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbo's virtues, rather than Achilles speed, strength, and skill with arms? How much less mature does this mere children's book of a well lit-world cause our darker fantasies to seem?Now, I admit I am biased in my review. I read this book 36 times before the age of 16. I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading. Yet in my defense I will say that I'm considered only a moderate fan of the book by many. I've known several devotees of the book who, like the protagonist of Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451', can recite whole chapters from memory - ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the world's technology if only the world's story tellers survived. If you are inclined to think no book can be that good, and that my review overhypes it, so much the better. Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded. Forget all I have said save that, ""If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable.""",5.0

I wouldn't be surprised if the germ of that book started with this chapter.03/17/2020 - 8%(1) Harry to Sirius: ""[Dudley] got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer thing you can play games on.""- Historical inaccuracy. This takes place in 1994, the Playstation didn't come out until late 1995.(2) Last book, Hermione's letter mentioned Ron five times. Ron's letter here mentions her once :(03/18/2020 - 10%(1) I think it's intentional, that right after Molly sort of intimidates Arthur into submission, Hermione does the same thing to Ron. It's juxtaposition!(2) I hear the name ""Ludo Bagman,"" and all I think of is ""Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong."" In my head he's Australian.(3) Wonder why Albania's such a hot wizard vacation destination?03/19/2020 - 11%(1) Apparently, wizards don't use the metric system. Arthur needs Harry to help him pay the campsite manager in muggle money.(2) ""The Lovegoods"" are mentioned here. Probably Luna and her father – her mother having passed.(3) The only thing we know about Cedric, thus far, is he's handsome and athletic. Same as last book. Worth reminding, I guess.03/20/2020 - 14%(1) In the book, Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys all cheer for Ireland. In the film, Harry and Ron support Bulgaria... I suppose so it doesn't look like they're all in Slytherin.(2) Crouch has a ""toothbrush mustache,"" also known as the Hitler mustache... or alternatively, the Charlie Chaplin mustache.(3) Crouch to Percy: ""Thank you, Weatherby.""03/21/2020 - 16%(1) The Bulgarian mascots are veela... who can entrance men at will. Women aren't affected, which is an argument for having some female players... at least when playing Bulgaria.(2) ""'Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!' Bagman shouted.""- ""Runners-up"" would have been more prudent, if only for political sensitivities.03/22/2020 - 18%(1) Just like ""Weird!"" is Ron's catchphrase, ""Honestly!"" is Hermione's. She says it, for example, whenever Harry or Ron are entranced by veela. You'd think ""the brightest witch of her age"" would understand it's involuntary.(2) In the books, Hermione's always scared, while Ron's brave in the face of danger. In the films, it's the other way around.03/23/2020 - 20%(1) Boy, after the World Cup, wizards be clamoring for portkeys like it's toilet paper at a Costco. Mass hysteria!(2) Harry says his scar hurt. Ron suggests they play quidditch to de-stress while Hermione insists he needs a nap. Ron and Hermione sort of have a fun parent/strict parent dynamic in this situation. Very much like Arthur and Molly do.03/24/2020 - 22%(1) Harry's dress robe is brand new and bottle-green, while Ron's is shabby, lacy and second-hand. It's totally Ron's Cinderella moment!(2) Bill: ""[Rita Skeeter] called me ‘a long-haired pillock’.""Molly: ""Well, it is a bit long, dear ... If you’d just let me —""Bill: ""No, Mum.""- In the film all the Weasley boys and Harry have really long hair!03/25/2020 - 24%(1) '""Hogwarts is hidden,"" said Hermione, in surprise. ""Everyone knows that ... well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History, anyway.”""Just you, then,” said Ron. ""So go on.""'- Hermione citing ""Hogwarts, A History,"" expecting everyone's read it, and Ron saying she's the only one who ever has never gets old. It's my favorite recurring bit.03/26/2020 - 26%(1) I just put together that ""Beauxbaton"" means ""beautiful wand"" in French. Mind blown! I don’t speak German so I can’t say if ""Durmstrang"" means anything. Though, knowing Rowling's penchant for stereotypes it's probably something downright Wagnerian: turmoil, fury and the like.(2) Apparently, Durmstrang offers courses in breakdancing. (see gif)03/27/2020 - 27%(1) ""Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth.""- Ironically, or fittingly, this is use to cure acne.(2) ""Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found extremely annoying.""- To be fair, he very often does nearly die.03/28/2020 - 29%(1) Lavender: ""Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?""Trelawney: ""It is Uranus, my dear.""Ron: ""Can I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?""- Ron will regret planting that seed.(2) Hagrid: “Yeh’ll do wha’ yer told or I’ll be takin’ a leaf outta Professor Moody’s book... I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.”- Sadly, Hagrid can't legally do magic.03/29/2020 - 30%(1) Moody forcing Neville to witness the imperius curse is really cruel, knowing the backstory.(2) '""It’s all right, sonny,” [Moody] said to Neville. “Why don’t you come up to my office?... we can have a cup of tea..."" Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody.'- Wonder how Moody prepares tea, and what china he uses.03/30/2020 - 32%(1) ""Harry’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney’s fire.""- As an alliteration aficionado, I approve.(2) '[Harry] just finished predicting his own death by decapitation. ""What’s in the box?"" he asked [Hermione], pointing at it.'- What's in the box? What's in the box!! (it's ""Se7en"" reference)03/31/2020 - 33%(1) Hermione turns on ""Hogwarts, A History"" for not mentioning house elf abuse. Priceless!(2) '""You only like [Cedric] because he’s handsome,"" said Ron scathingly.“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said Hermione indignantly.Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like ""Lockhart!""'- Ron with the sick burn!04/01/2020 - 34%(1) The Beauxbatons sit with the Ravenclaws and the Durmstrangs sit with the Slytherins. Thus foreshadowing that Hogwarts' champion will come from Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, or both.(2) Ron: ""What’s that?""Hermione: ""Bouillabaisse""Ron: ""Bless you.""Hermione: ""It’s French ... It’s very nice.""- Hermione, quickly after, stops liking French things.04/02/2020 - 36%(1) Hagrid dresses for courting just the same as he does for court!(2) The Goblet of Fire is made of wood! Must be non-flammable wood.(3) ""[Crouch's] toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd.""- Yes, uncomfortably odd. The mustache had me wondering, but the ""severe parting"" confirmed it. Crouch is intended to remind you of Hitler.04/03/2020 - 38%(1) '""Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once ... ""Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!"" Somewhere under Harry’s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?'- Well, Harry is somewhat shorter than average.(2) ""Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?” [Dumbledore] asked calmly.""- Yes, ""calmly."" See gif.04/04/2020 - 40%(1) The Gryffindors throw a party to celebrate Harry (supposedly) cheating to get into the tournament. Celebrating deceit seems more like a Slytherin thing to me.(2) Stephen Fry uses the same voice for both Hermione and Professor McGonagall. I don't know if it shows a lack of range for female voices, or if he's actually making some subtle point.04/05/2020 - 42%(1) Malfoy turns Hermione's front teeth the size of tusks. Ron, instead of immediately trying to fist-fight Malfoy, runs to comfort Hermione. That's character development!(2) Rita Skeeter forces Harry to squeeze into a dark broom closet with her for an interview. In my head I'm screaming, ""He's underage! That's the whole reason for the scandal!""04/06/2020 - 44%(1) Last book it was Hermione who was on the outs with Harry and Ron, here it's the opposite. I appreciate the mirroring!(2) Rita Skeeter writes that Hermione's Harry's girlfriend... thus begins the boy-girl drama!(3) Hermione: ""[Krum]'s not even good-looking! ... [girls] only like him because he’s famous!""- She'll change her tune soon enough.04/07/2020 - 46%(1) Hagrid shows Maxime, and by proxy Beauxbâtons, the secret first task simply to get her to like him. On one hand, it's helping the competition. On the other hand, everyone cheats anyway, and at least he gets the girl.(2) '""Never mind me, how are you?"" said Sirius seriously.'- It finally happened! Been waiting the last two books for that pun.04/08/2020 - 48%(1) '""Hermione,"" Harry said, through gritted teeth, ""will you shut up for a bit, please?""'- Without Ron, I guess the job of reining in Hermione falls to Harry.(2) Moody: ""Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.""- I knew it! Though knowing the twist at the end, I question how true this statement actually is.04/09/2020 - 50%(1) '""Got a plan?"" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them, you know.""'- Bagman low-key offering to help Harry cheat sounds a lot like the start of a drug deal.(2) Rita Skeeter: ""I wonder if you could give me a quick word?""Harry: ""Yeah, you can have a word ... Goodbye.""04/10/2020 - 52%(1) Viktor Krum persistently stalking Hermione in the library is at the same time endearing and creepy.(2) Shame the whole ""Blast-Ended Skrewts"" subplot was cut from the film. I would have liked to see what ""the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen"" looked like.(3) Apparently, one elf's servile emancipation is another elf's grievous shame.04/11/2020 - 55%(1) ""Why do they have to move in packs?"" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them .... ""How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?""'- I've totally been there.(2) 'Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.""Hermione ... you are a girl!""""Oh well spotted,"" she said acidly.'04/12/2020 - 56%(1) ""Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron. He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.""- In other words, ""Who's my new nemesis?""(2) Parvati: ""Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall.""Ron: ""Right ... Where’s Hermione?""- Wrong girl, Ron! Focus!04/13/2020 - 57%(1) Dumbledore apparently found the Room of Requirement, filled with chamber pots, when he needed to urinate.(2) 'Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her ""Hermy-own.""""Her-my-oh-nee,"" she said slowly and clearly.""Herm-own-ninny.""""Close enough,"" she said.'- Before I knew better, I pronounced it ""Hermy-won.""04/14/2020 - 58%(1) ""The Weird Sisters ... were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.""- Nice bit of historical accuracy there. 1994 was the very height of ""artfully ripped and torn"" clothes.(2) Ron insists Krum only asked Hermione to the Ball to get info on Harry. Jealousy aside, that's actually a legit concern.04/15/2020 - 59%(1) Hermione: ""Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!""Ron: ""Well — that just proves — completely missed the point —""Narrator: ""[Harry] somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.""- The saddest non-death scene of the series.- Hermione's tough, but so weak for Ron :(04/16/2020 - 61%(1) Ron lays down some serious knowledge on giants. Filmmakers take note, Ron’s not dumb.(2) ""Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal.""- Yes, classic ""drunk at the office X-mas party and overcompensating the next day"" behavior.04/17/2020 - 63%(1) Don't know if it's been accentuated, but Harry looks downright tiny in the gif.(2) Harry: ""What d’you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?""Myrtle: ""Sometimes, but I’ve never come out to speak to anyone before.""Harry: ""I’m honored. You keep your eyes shut!""- Moaning Myrtle... more like Pervy Myrtle, amiright?04/18/2020 - 65%(1) Apparently, Myrtle being stuck in Hogwarts is sort of a jail sentence. The Ministry confined her there permanently for stalking Olive Hornby. So, technically she's a convict under a kind of house arrest.(2) Ironic how it's ""Moody"" who gives Harry the idea to pursue a career as an auror. I guess good ideas are good ideas no matter the source.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

I don't really understand it, and Dumbledore won't explain properly.""- Well, horcruxes are forbidden knowledge.06/25/2020 - 6%(1) ""A threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp.""- How vampire-chic.- Snape's house could use a woman's touch.(2) ""In her fury [Bellatrix] looked slightly mad.""- I guess she's always in her ""fury"" then.(3) I never hear of wizard divorces... perhaps they make unbreakable vows?06/26/2020 - 9%(1) ""Rufus Scrimgeour ... has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm.""- Appointment? By who? There doesn't appear to be any wizarding monarch or anything.(2) J.K. Rowling does love giving animal descriptions to antagonists: Scrimgeour is ""lionlike,"" Petunia has a ""horsey face,"" Vernon has ""piggy eyes,"" etc.06/27/2020 - 13%(1) We're introduced to the idea of inferi, which are essentially zombies. The lack of a full-blown zombie chase is one of the series' big missed opportunities.(2) ""The wandlight sparkled on [Slughorn's] shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache ...""- Again with the animal descriptors.(3) Gwenog Jones must be the Welshest name ever.06/28/2020 - 17%Harry and Ginny be like, ""I shouldn't have been so happy about that hug.""(1) Two weeks since last book and Hermione's already at the Burrow when Harry arrives? Poor Hermione's parents.(2) ""Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.""- Already giving each other married couple signals.(3) Hermione: ""I know I failed everything!""06/29/2020 - 20%(1) Fred to Ginny: ""Moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren't you?""- Well, one per year's not so fast. Though, compared to the other Weasleys, I suppose.(2) '""Our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,"" said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black hooter-type objects.'- I presume ""hooter"" means something different in British English.06/30/2020 - 23%(1) '""She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,"" Fleur mused.'- Sounds like Fleur's finally cottoned onto Molly and Ginny's cunning plan to get Bill to dump her for Tonks.(2) In the books, Luna's Spectrespecs are a kind of snake oil novelty. In the film they actually work! Film Luna is treated as more of an eccentric than the books, where she's sort of a lovable gullible.07/01/2020 - 26%Ginny be like: ""Get a room you two.""(1) It's a mark of Ron and Hermione's closeness that she's comfortable enough to hit him repeatedly with a book, and he's comfortable enough to let her.(2) Nearly Headless Nick: ""I would rather die than betray [Harry's] trust.""Ron: ""That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead.""- Ron again with the common sense.07/02/2020 - 29%Finally! Book-accurate bushy hair!(1) Snape: ""We are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter.""Harry: ""Yes.""Snape: ""Yes, sir.""Harry: ""There's no need to call me 'sir,' Professor.""- New levels of reckless sass.(2) Harry smells something flowery in the love potion. Just 10 pages later, Harry smells something flowery and turns to see Ginny.- Not exactly subtle.07/03/2020 - 33%(1) The House of Gaunt has a very Craster's Keep vibe to it.(2) Merope seems right out of a Jane Austen novel.(3) Dumbledore: ""The Gaunts [were] noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins.""- Not so different than European royals, then... and a fair bit better than Egyptians.07/04/2020 - 36%(1) Ron gets attention from Lavender, Hermione gives him the cold shoulder. Hermione congratulates Ron, Lavender walks off grumpy. Meanwhile, Ron's totally oblivious.(2) Harry: ""But wasn't that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you?""- Hermione gets a taste of her own medicine here, seeing as she says this to Ron all the time, albeit less polite.07/05/2020 - 39%Callback/Mirroring: You've got something on your face.(1) Harry: ""The Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.""- Oh the irony.(2) Hermione: ""Ron, what are you staring at?""Ron: ""Nothing.""Hermione: ""I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky.""- Ron crushing on Madam Rosmerta and Hermione being jealous never gets old.07/06/2020 - 42%(1) Wonder if Caractacus Burke was named after the Briton chieftain or the dad from Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang?(2) Orphanage matron: ""He was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a circus.""- Hmm... The Great Marvolo!(3) Young Voldemort owning a harmonica is just plain funny.07/07/2020 - 44%(1) Harry: ""What if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it?""- Depends how much they enjoy bickering... it's kind of their thing.(2) ""What if they didn't split up? What if ... it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?""- Classic third-wheel talk right there.07/08/2020 - 46%(1) Harry: ""Ginny, don't call Ron a prat, you're not the Captain of this team.""Ginny: ""Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat.""- Can't fault the logic.(2) Ginny teases Ron for ""never snogg[ing] anyone in his life."" She also tells Ron ""Hermione snogged Viktor Krum."" Enraged and shamed, Ron snogs stalkerish Lavender Brown. Ergo, Ginny's to blame for that mess.07/09/2020 - 48%Ron makes Hermione cry on stairs a lot.(1) Ron: ""She can't complain ... She snogged Krum. So she's found out someone wants to snog me too ... I haven't done anything wrong.""- Ron's not wrong, but misses the point.(2) Hermione: ""He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes ... I really couldn't care less.""- She sure talks about it a lot for not caring.07/10/2020 - 49%(1) '""Are you going out with [Cormac], then?"" asked Parvati, wide-eyed.""Oh — yes — didn't you know?"" said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.'- I doubt there's even a Hermione-ish giggle. Mostly she blushes.(2) Harry: ""Serves you right for coming with [Cormac].""Hermione: ""I thought he'd annoy Ron most.""- I expect no less from a jealousy-fueled romance.07/11/2020 - 51%(1) ""Harry ... was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.""- Hopefully those dreams aren't Voldemort's doing.(2) ""Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.""07/12/2020 - 53%Harry and Ginny be like: Not cool bro!(1) Kreacher gifts Harry a box of maggots. Not useful, but it's the thought that counts.(2) '""Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,' said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.'- Most romantic maggot scene in fiction?07/13/2020 - 56%(1) ""Abstinence"" is the new common room password. Sneaky, having students recite it repeatedly.(2) Harry: ""Hermione, can't you [make up with Ron]?""Hermione: ""No, I can't... So don't even ask.""- Can't or won't?(3) ""The contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?""- Eh, only the regrettable ones.07/14/2020 - 58%(1) Hermione: ""Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you'd better do it ... After all, when has Won-Won's judgment ever been faulty?""- It's contagious! Now Hermione's saying ""Won-Won."" Sarcasm, yes, but ""Won-Won"" regardless.(2) ""Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender 'Lav-Lav,' [Harry] would have to put his foot down.""- The buck stops at ""Lav-Lav""!07/15/2020 - 60%Poor Lavender :((1) Hermione: ""Golpalott's Third Law states that the antidote for a blended poison will be equal to more than the sum of the antidotes for each of the separate components.""- That makes no sense! How can something be equal to more than a sum? It would just be greater than it!(2) The gif never happens in the book, but it's my favorite scene :)07/16/2020 - 62%(1) ""[Harry] was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown. He could not decide which of them was more annoying.""- I vote Lavender.(2) ""Harry's imagination zoomed into overdrive ... Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing.""- Pretty passive ambition there.07/17/2020 - 64%(1) Lavender: ""Is Hermione Granger still visiting [Ron]?""Harry: ""Yeah, I think so. Well, they're friends, aren't they?""Lavender: ""Friends, don't make me laugh ... She didn't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he's all interesting.""- Now we know what Lavender looks for in a partner. Interesting.07/18/2020 - 68%(1) Lavender to Ron: ""Why didn't you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?""- I suppose a condition of being Lavender's boyfriend is having to cut loose all your female friends.(2) Voldemort: ""You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.""Dumbledore: ""Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen.""- That's some stealthy foreshadowing there.07/19/2020 - 71%(1) Ron: ""I love you, Hermione.""Hermione: ""Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.""Ron: ""I won't ... Or maybe I will ... then she'll ditch me.""- Essentially, that's what happened in the film.(2) The Imperius Curse = Temporary insanity defense.(3) Harry supposes Tonks was in love with Sirius, which no one thinks is weird. Wizard views on incest are oddly casual.07/20/2020 - 73%(1) Ron: ""Quick, hide me!""Hermione: ""It isn't Lavender!""- If it were Lavender, I think hiding behind Hermione would make things much worse.(2) Harry hesitates to use his vial of Felix Felicis, having saved it to break up Ginny and Dean. Luckily, that happened as a side effect of his Slughorn mission. So, bonus points.- Incidentally, Harry's low-key a homewrecker.07/21/2020 - 75%(1) '""What were you doing up there with her?"" shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories.'- Lavender's suspicions confirmed!- Lucky all around... except Lavender.(2) Slughorn: ""Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.""- I see what she did there :)07/22/2020 - 78%(1) '""You have [uncommon skill and power],"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —""""I know!"" said Harry impatiently. ""I can love!"" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, ""Big deal!"".'- I had the same reaction as Harry to the ending of ""The Fifth Element."" ""Really? Love is the greatest power there is?""07/23/2020 - 82%(1) Flitwick: ""A little less talk, a little more action.""- Wasn't that an Elvis song? No, wait, that was ""A Little Less Conversation.""(2) Harry's mind: ""She's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean! She's still Ron's sister. I'm his best mate! That'll make it worse. If I talked to him first — He'd hit you. What if I don't care? He's your best mate!""- Ron, Ron, Ron.07/24/2020 - 85%(1) Ginny: ""All Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ... I told her it's a Hungarian Horntail ... Much more macho.""- Harry's already kinda got a lightning bolt tattoo, and on his face too! I'd guess that's be even more macho.(2) ""Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement.""- Fight it! Angst was so Book 5.07/25/2020 - 86%(1) Perhaps Harry's grown too used to magic. He's fine charging headlong into danger, but a short swim in cold water totally freaks him out. Who is he? Film-Ron?(2) ""Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.""- I wonder if he's referring to Seamus, who's gimmick is he often accidentally blows things up?07/26/2020 - 87%(1) How is Harry shocked that blood magic is a thing? Voldemort was revived by his blood!(2) Dumbldore: ""You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.""- So... Harry should be glad the alarm can't detect his negligible amount of magic.07/27/2020 - 88%(1) Harry needs blood to open the archway. Luckily, he was already cut whilst fighting Inferi. Even zombies have a silver lining.(2) '""It's going to be all right, sir,"" Harry said over and over again ... ""Don't worry...""""I am not worried, Harry,"" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ""I am with you.""'- Hits me right in the feels.*character limitClick here for the rest",5.0

I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.""- Interesting how, despite not hearing the prophesy, Voldemort came to the same solution on his own. Albeit for different reasons.(2) Bellatrix is the worst kind of groupie.(3) Tonks and Lupin are married already? I guess they eloped.08/05/2020 - 4%(1) I don't want to attribute symbolism where there might be none, but wizards really do react to their wands being broken like they've been gelded.(2) ""The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.""- Hermione has been plenty stupid before. It's just that hers has to do with common sense.08/06/2020 - 6%(1) ""What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike?""- I mean, saying nothing is always an option, that is, if you dislike them enough to not even want to talk.(2) It wouldn't surprise me at all if Dedalus Diggle was modeled after the White Rabbit. He's short, constantly checks his giant pocket watch, and always worries about being late.08/07/2020 - 8%(1) Re Polyjuice: '""Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,"" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly.'- Foreshadowing the later Ron subplot.(2) '""Hold tight now, Ron,"" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on ... her waist.'- Well, can't look too eager.08/08/2020 - 11%(1) Lupin: ""Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!""- Exactly what I've been saying!(2) 'Hermione flew at [Ron] and hugged him tightly.

207,A Game of Thrones,,4.44,"['August', '6,', '1996']","There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre. Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a fulfilling climax. At the worst, it's just a bloodless rehash. Unfortunately, the worst are more common by far.Perhaps it was this abundance of cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different. Unfortunately, you can't just choose to be different, any more than you can choose to be creative. Sure, Moorcock's original concept for Elric was to be the anti-Conan, but at some point, he had to push his limits and move beyond difference for difference's sake--and he did.In similar gesture, Martin rejects the allegorical romance of epic fantasy, which basically means tearing out the guts of the genre: the wonder, the ideals, the heroism, and with them, the moral purpose. Fine, so he took out the rollicking fun and the social message--what did he replace them with?Like the post-Moore comics of the nineties, fantasy has already borne witness to a backlash against the upright, moral hero--and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him. Hell, if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes in an amoral world, he didn't have to reject the staples of fantasy, he could have gone to its roots: Howard, Leiber, and Anderson.Like many authors aiming for realism, he forgets 'truth is stranger than fiction'. The real world is full of unbelievable events, coincidences, and odd characters. When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real, they make their fiction duller than reality; after all, unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitude. When Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance, they replaced it with the odd and absurd--moments strange enough to feel true. In comparison, Martin's world is dull and gray. Instead of innovating new, radical elements, he merely removes familiar staples--and any style defined by lack is going to end up feeling thin.Yet, despite trying inject the book with history and realism, he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers, as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist (with pet albino wolf). Apparently to him, 'grim realism' is 'Draco in Leather Pants'. This produces a conflicted tone: a soap opera cast lost in an existentialist film.There's also lots of sex and misogyny, and 'wall-to-wall rape'--not that books should shy away from sex, or from any uncomfortable, unpleasant reality of life. The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it, which seems to plague every mainstream fantasy author. Their pen gets away from them, their own hangups start leaking into the scene, until it's not even about the characters anymore, it's just the author cybering about his favorite fetish--and if I cyber with a fat, bearded stranger, I expect to be paid for it.I know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do (like night elf hunters humping away in WOW), but reading Goodkind, Jordan, and Martin--it's like seeing a Playboy at your uncle's where all the pages are wrinkled. That's not to say there isn't serviceable pop fantasy sex out there--it's just written by women.Though I didn't save any choice examples, I did come across this quote from a later book:
""... she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest . . .""
Imagine the process: Martin sits, hands hovering over the keys, trying to get inside his character's head:""Okay, I'm a woman. How do I see and feel the world differently? My cultural role is defined by childbirth. I can be bought and sold in marriage by my own--Oh, hey! I've got tits! Man, look at those things go. *whooshing mammary sound effects* Okay, time to write.""Where are the descriptions of variously-sized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdly-detailed clothing? There are a set of manboobs (which perhaps Martin has some personal experience with) but not until book five. Even then, it's not the dude being hyperaware of his own--they're just there to gross out a dwarf. Not really a balanced depiction.If you're familiar with the show (and its parodies on South Park and SNL) this lack of dongs may surprise you. But as Martin himself explained, when asked why there's no gay sex in his books, despite having gay characters, 'they’re not the viewpoint characters'--as if somehow, the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control. Apparently, he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author: sorry none of my characters chose to be gay, nothing I can do about it.And balance really is the problem here--if you only depict the dark, gritty stuff that you're into, that's not realism, it's just a fetish. If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape, but the same thing never happens to a male character, despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women, then your 'gritty realism card' definitely gets revoked.The books are notorious for the sudden, pointless deaths, which some suggest is another sign of realism--but, of course, nothing is pointless in fiction, because everything that shows up on the page is only there because the author put it there. Sure, in real life, people suddenly die before finishing their life's work (fantasy authors do it all the time), but there's a reason we don't tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things: they are boring and pointless. They build up for a while then eventually, lead nowhere.Novelists often write in isolation, so it's easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere: your story is always a fiction. Any time you treat it as if it were real, you are working against yourself. The writing that feels the most natural is never effortless, it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that way.A staple of Creative Writing 101 is to 'listen to how people really talk', which is terrible advice. A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition, half-thoughts, and non-specific words ('stuff', 'thing') as to be incomprehensible--especially without the cues of tone and body language. Written communication has its own rules, so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play. It's the same with sudden character deaths: treat them like a history, and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow.Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable. Like in an action film, they are a plot convenience: kill off a villain, and you don't have to wrap up his arc. You don't have to defeat him psychologically--the finality of his death is the great equalizer. You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right, because he's the only option left.Likewise, in Martin's book, death ties up loose threads--namely, plot threads. Often, this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs, which makes them rather predictable: any time a character is about to build up enough influence to make things better, or more stable, he will die. Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the action will first be built up, and then killed off.I found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths:
""I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... sure, he’s going to get into trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing [someone] is going to rise up and avenge his [death] ... So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.
He's not talking about the characters' motivations, or the ideas they represent, or their role in the story--he isn't laying out a well-structured plot, he's just killing them off for pure shock value.Yet the only reason we think these characters are important in the first place is because Martin treats them as central heroes, spending time and energy building them. Then it all ends up being a red herring, a cheap twist, the equivalent of a horror movie jump scare. It's like mystery novels in the 70's, after all the good plots had been done, so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapter--it's only surprising because the author has obliterated the story structure.All plots are made up of arcs that grow and change, building tension and purpose. Normally, when an arc ends, the author must use all his skill to deal with themes and answer questions, providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers watched grow. Or just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him. Then you don't have to worry about closure, you can just hook your readers by focusing on the mess caused by the previous arc falling apart. Make the reader believe that things might get better, get them to believe in a character, then wave your arms in distraction, point and yell 'look at that terrible thing, over there!', and hope they become so caught up in worrying about the new problem that they forget the old one was never resolved.Chaining false endings together creates perpetual tension that never requires solution--like in most soap operas--plus, the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started. If an author is lucky, they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for, and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up. It's easy to idolize Kurt Cobain, because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee Roth.Unlucky authors live to write the Final Book, breaking the spell of unending tension that kept their readers enthralled. Since the plot isn't resolving into a tight, intertwined conclusion (in fact, it's probably spiraling out of control, with ever more characters and scenes), the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly, leaving fans confused and upset. Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy, Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguely-spiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tacked-on climax (actually, he'll probably do it anyways, with dragons--the longer the series goes on, the more it starts to resemble the cliche monomyth that Martin was praised for eschewing in the first place).The drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end, the story fundamentally leads nowhere--it winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs. But then, doesn't that sound more like real life? Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy, and in doing so, rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions. Perhaps we shouldn't compare him to works of romance, but to histories.He asks us to believe in his intrigue, his grimness, and his amoral world of war, power, and death--not the false Europe of Arthur, Robin Hood, and Orlando, but the real Europe of plagues, political struggles, religious wars, witch hunts, and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countryside. Unfortunately, he doesn't compare very well to them, either. His intrigue is not as interesting as Cicero's, Machiavelli's, Enguerrand de Coucy's--or even Sallust's, who was practically writing fiction, anyways. Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history, but these are the same histories that lent Howard, Leiber, and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude. Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield: even Tolkien had his Eddas. Despite being fictionalized and dramatized, Martin's take on The War of the Roses is far duller than the original.More than anything, this book felt like a serial melodrama: the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with, being drawn in by emotional appeals (the hope that things will 'get better' in this dark place, 'tragic' deaths), even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism, and in the end, there is no grander story to unify the whole. This 'grittiness' is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of 'glory' with one of 'hardship', and despite flipping this switch, it's still just an emotional appeal. 'Heroes always win' is just as blandly predictable as 'heroes always lose'.It's been suggested that I didn't read enough of Martin to judge him, but if the first four hundred pages aren't good, I don't expect the next thousand will be different. If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories, you get 1,263 pages (including introductions, end notes, and variant scripts). If you take Martin's first two books in this series, you get 1,504 pages. Already, less than a third of the way into the series, he's written more than Howard's entire Conan output, and all I can do is ask myself: why does he need that extra length?A few authors use it to their advantage, but for most, it's just sprawling, undifferentiated bloat. Melodrama can be a great way to mint money, as evidenced by the endless 'variations on a theme' of soap operas, pro wrestling, and superhero comics. People get into it, but it's neither revolutionary nor realistic. You also hear the same things from the fans: that it's all carefully planned, all interconnected, all going somewhere. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson from the anticlimactic fizzling out of Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, and Battlestar. Then again, you wouldn't keep watching if you didn't think it was going somewhere.Some say 'at least he isn't as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy', but saying he's better than dreck is really not very high praise. Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all, pointing to my low-star reviews of Martin, Wolfe, Jordan, and Goodkind, but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authors.A lover of fine wines winces the more at a corked bottle of vinegar, a ballet enthusiast's love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition--and likewise, having learned to appreciate epics, histories, knightly ballads, fairy tales, and their modern offspring in fantasy, I find Martin woefully lacking. There's plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there, from its roots to the dozens of fantasy authors, both old and modern, whom I list in the link at the end of this reviewThere seems to be a sense that Martin's work is somehow revolutionary, that it represents a 'new direction' for fantasy, but all I see is a reversion. Sure, he's different than Jordan, Goodkind, and their ilk, who simply took the pseudo-medieval high-magic world from Tolkien and the blood-and-guts heroism from Howard. Martin, on the other hand, has more closely followed Tolkien's lead than any other modern high fantasy author--and I don't just mean in terms of racism.Tolkien wanted to make his story real--not 'realistic', using the dramatic techniques of literature--but actually real, by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story. Over the span of the first twenty years, he released The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and other works, while in the twenty years after that, he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories, he filled his shed with a bunch of notes (which his son has been trying to make a complete book from ever since).It's the same thing Martin's trying to do: cover a bland story with a litany of details that don't contribute meaningfully to his characters, plot, or tone. So, if Martin is good because he is different, then it stands to reason that he's not very good, because he's not that different. He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style, but that's just one small corner of a very expansive genre. Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the 'father of fantasy' doesn't know enough about the genre to judge what 'originality' means.So, if Martin neither an homage nor an original, I'm not sure what's left. In his attempt to set himself apart, he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy, but failed replace it with anything. There is no revolutionary voice here, and there is nothing in Martin's book that has not been done better by other authors.However, there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do: kill the longrunning High Fantasy series. According to some friends of mine in publishing (and some on-the-nose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview on his own foray into fantasy), Martin's inability to deliver a book on time, combined with his strained relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy series--even from recognized authors. Apparently, Martin is so bad at plot structure that he actually pre-emptively ruined books by other authors. Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings . . .Though I declined to finish this book, I'll leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue on:""If you need some kind of closure, avoid this series. No arcs will ever be completed, nothing will ever really change. The tagline is 'Winter is Coming'--it's not. As the series goes on, there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of, many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other, even as it increasingly becomes just another cliche, fascist 'chosen one' monomyth, like every other fantasy series out there. If you enjoy a grim, excessively long soap opera with lots of deaths and constant unresolved tension, pick up the series--otherwise, maybe check out the show.""My Fantasy Book Suggestions",1.0
208,The Fellowship of the Ring,,4.39,"['July', '29,', '1954']","Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's 
The Broken Sword
, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he’s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien’s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It’s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it’s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that’s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien’s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the ‘depth of its world building’, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero’s cuirass, we'll forget that he’s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should ‘murder their darlings’, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien’s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock’s 
Epic Pooh
 and Mieville’s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn’t some special author, some ‘fantasy granddad’ looming over all. He’s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren’t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien’s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",3.0

It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.
The Writing
The title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I am not going to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attempted rape of Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she gets sexually assaulted by Tamlin, who was still high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after the attack, she's thinking, Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is a very wrong and dangerous way of thinking. No matter what, it is never okay for anyone to make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to ""dance"" for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost made less sense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.
The Worldbuilding
The Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.
The Characters
Faerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves because Tamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen. She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangerous sociopath with a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen. Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.
Conclusion
While I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",1.0
210,A Clash of Kings,,4.42,"['November', '16,', '1998']","Instead of writing a review, I'm just going to post a list of the facial expressions I made while reading this book:



































However... I feel this one most accurately sums up A Clash of Kings:",
211,The Two Towers,,4.48,"['November', '11,', '1954']","4.5/5 stars

 “It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end… because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing… this shadow. Even darkness must pass.” 

Friendship, hope, resilience, faith, justice, and bravery; these days, good-hearted with no grey morality characters are much easier for fantasy readers to dismiss. I totally get it; this type of characters and stories have been done more than a million times in fantasy stories, and readers—myself included—sometimes prefer more complexity. However, I also personally think that these kinds of characters are still much needed in the stories we devour. Maybe even more than ever. The Two Towers, being the second part of The Lord of the Rings, touches upon these themes by transporting its readers to an old and familiar ground, which I highly enjoyed reading.I’m genuinely surprised by how fast and immersed I am with reading The Two Towers. To be honest, I never expected to find myself compelled from reading most of Tolkien’s work, but I certainly did with this one. This is surprising to me because The Two Towers have often been mentioned as being even slower and tedious than The Fellowship of the Ring by several fans of the series. There’s something about The Two Towers that worked reasonably well with me. To be clear, there’s no clear beginning and ending with this volume, but that’s also why what the characters faced in The Two Towers resonated; they’re doing whatever they can with the hope that their faith towards one another will be rewarded. Many people in this world say and believe that true faith is achieved once you believe in something that you can’t see with your eyes. After what happened at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, the main characters are plagued with doubts on whether they can succeed in completing the journey they set out to do. And yet they persevere. Honestly, what they had was only the faith that everything will maybe turn out alright if they do everything they respectively can do the best.And isn’t that what we all do in our lives?

 “War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.” 

I’m also, once again, amazed at the film’s portrayal of the Battle of Helm’s Deep. Now that I’ve read the scene in the original text for the first time, I will say that what the movie did on this sequence was so much more superior to what’s written. I’m not saying that Tolkien’s Battle of Helm’s Deep was poorly written, it’s just that the movie took the best quality of the text and increased the buildup, the tensions, and the execution of the battle dramatically. Picture: The Two Towers by Jonathan BurtonIf there’s one thing that the books do better, it would be the world-building and the characterizations for Faramir and Frodo. Frodo in the movies, in my opinion, was mediocre. I liked Frodo in the book more, and I think Tolkien’s writing of Frodo and Samwise Gamgee’s friendship was wonderfully done; it’s no wonder the movie could execute their friendship to its maximum potential. I’ve been saying this since I first watched the movies, and I will repeat it again that everyone needs a Samwise Gamgee in their life.

'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. ""I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?""''Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.''So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am.” 

As for the parts that didn’t work for me, I’m going to keep this brief by saying that every single scene revolving around Merry, Pippin, Treebeards, and the Ents bored me to oblivion. Thankfully, there aren’t too many of them, but wow they totally tested my patience; their scenes were as painfully slow as the Ent’s communication with each other.Picture: Fangorn Forest by Donato GiancolaOverall, though, despite a few issues, I definitely enjoyed reading The Two Towers more than reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Not going to lie, it helps a lot that there’s no Tom Bombadil’s nonsense here. I only have one more book left, once I’m done reading The Return of the King, it would mean that I’m finally done with Middle-Earth (I’ve read Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and the three Great Tales of Middle-Earth) after all these years.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons on Patreon for giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe.",4.0
212,The Name of the Wind,,4.52,"['March', '27,', '2007']","I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfuss. For realz, actual sorry. Honestly. I tried giving your book two stars out of pity, since I so wanted to like it and I'd feel bad about giving it one star and dragging down your average rating. Though you don't appear to need my pity. Your book has the highest average GR rating (4.49) of any of the book I've read. I finally dropped my rating down to one star because it's just a steaming pile of crap and I couldn't take the embarrassment of having posted a two-star rating on something so awful.Mr. Rothfuss, you probably don't give a shit about my rating since, judging from your GR biography, you appear to be very comfortable in your own academic, geeky skin. And that is totally cool. I'm an academic, geeky type myself. Not as geeky as you. You are really geeky. Like I said: that's cool. Anywayz, for a long time I gave you two stars since a couple of my most favorite people (my brother and his fiancé) both love your book. One star for each of them. But, like I hinted, the book is pretty bad. So are you and me good? No hard feelings? Awesome. I don't take shit too personally, either. So now I'll get down to ripping your book, knowing we can still be friends.In the interest of full disclosure, I faithfully admit that this book goes in my DNF shelf. I made it 162 pages in (I was reading it on the Kindle app on my iPhone and made it to § 3154, but with little arithmetic I determined that was the equivalent of page 162 in the mass market paperback). I just couldn't finish it. I gave it a good honest try and eventually found myself reading only so I wouldn't have to admit to my brother that I didn't like it enough to finish. But that isn't a good reason to spend my time—something we have precious little of in our short lives—reading something I dislike and not getting paid for it. So I'm sorry, bro. I tried. (Yes, my brother is one of my GR friends and will likely see this review.) Now on to the reasons I couldn't finish the book.Most of The Name of the Wind is written in the first person; it's the autobiography of Kvothe, who has a number of things in common with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Kvothe is reciting his life story to a scribe while his male companion, Bast, looks on.FOOTNOTEThere are several interesting facts pertaining to Kvothe and Bast. First, Bast is described as ""sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes."" Second, Kvothe and Bast run a bed-and-breakfast. Third, Bast follows Kvothe around like a puppy dog. Fourth, Bast likes to tuck Kvothe into bed and watch him sleep. Fifth, Bast cries like a little girl when he hears something sad. Finally, Bast apparently can manifest himself as some sort of goat-man creature. Do you see where I'm going with this? Kvothe runs a bed-and-breakfast, in which a very sensitive and beautiful man follows him around and occasionally turns into a goat. Bed-and-breakfast and goat-men: what could be sexier? Not that there's anything wrong with that. I believe everyone should have the freedom be who they were born to be and I have several close friends who happen to be gay; I'm the last person who would have a problem with Kvothe and his beautiful male companion getting frisky (goat-style, of course). I only mention the implied homoerotic connection because Kvothe (a.k.a. The Most Interesting Man in the World) is supposed to be a lady-killer. No, not a psycho rapist murderer, you freaks. A lady-killa. A Lover of Women. I suppose that's not necessarily inconsistent; perhaps Kvothe swings both ways. Let's all say it together, now: not that there's anything wrong with that.END FOOTNOTENot all of the book, however, is written in the first-person. First-person narrative is reserved for Kvothe's recitation of his life story. The remainder of the book, particularly the scenes of Kvothe manhandling his lover in front of the scribe (Bast said Kvothe leaves bruises), are written in the third-person. I'll address my displeasure with the third-person sections first.Let me clarify at the outset that I have no problem with the writer switching between first-person and third-person narrative. I recognize it can be a powerful tool and it serves the structure of this story quite well. The book begins in the third-person, then as Kvothe tells his life story it switches to first-person, then back to third-person for occasional interludes. My problem is with the author switching his narrative voice within the third-person sections. The academic geek is all over the place in that regard. Sometimes he writes a scene in third-person subjective, other times third-person objective. Some passages read like third-person limited, others third-person omniscient. At points the author seemed to switch voice page to page, or even paragraph to paragraph. In one especially irritating scene he even threw in a hint of first-person for a paragraph or so. Maybe if I'd kept reading I would have found a scene or two in second-person, just for good measure. The switching of narrative voices was confusing and frustrating.Perhaps the author saw his story as being so epic and/or complex that a third-person omniscient narrator was called for throughout. I certainly understand the advantages of an omniscient narrator that can relate some scenes from one character's point of view and others from a second character's point of view, and so on. But that theory doesn't fit The Name of the Wind. With most of the book, indeed the real meat of the story, being written in the first-person, the third-person sections are a minority and seem almost incidental, merely setting the stage and creating some dynamic/juxtaposition. And the theory doesn't explain why some scenes are told from the points of view of everyone present (a voice that strikes me as pompous and unreal) while other scenes are described objectively, from nobody's point of view. Still other scenes alternate points of view paragraph by paragraph, or even sentence by sentence, and at a couple of points I wasn't entirely sure who's thoughts I was reading. Such constant switching without an obvious purpose or pattern made the omniscient narrator (if that's what was intended) seem unreliable.Now on to the bulk of the book: Kvothe's first-person account of his life story. Kvothe's account actually read much smoother than the third-person interludes. Without the worry of mixing up his voices, the author did a much better job on the first-person narrative. Indeed, Kvothe's story incorporates some fair (not horrible, not great) drama, suspense, and sentiment. Portions are even quite quotable. The Author was thoughtful and observant in his telling of Kvothe's story, relating events and thoughts with which I could identify and pointing out a few things I wouldn’t have thought of. Unfortunately, for the reasons set forth below, those good qualities were not sufficient to demand my continued attention.Many passages in Kvothe's story felt lazy, unnecessary, unintended, or unoriginal. A few things were just plain weird. For example:--> Kvothe asks his father a question and the father makes a big deal about wanting to answer with a poem, but after five lines he forgets the rest. Setting aside that the five remembered lines were some shitty poetry, why is the rest forgotten? If the poem was important, then the author should have taken the time (or sought the help) to craft something decent for the father to recite. If the poem was not important, why have the father recite a poem at all? A pointless poem only serves to clutter the prose. --> As a boy Kvothe watched his parents make out so he could learn kissing technique. That's weird.--> Speaking of Kvothe watching his parents, he has some sort of Oedipal affection for his mother. It shows in a few places but never more so than when he describes his mother as ""slender, fresh, and bright, pale and smooth-skinned in the firelight."" I have trouble reconciling the Oedipus Complex with ""The Most Interesting Man in the World."" Unless I just misunderstand one or the other?2ND FOOTNOTEWhat I find especially interesting is my suspicion that the author was not consciously creating the Oedipal attraction. Similarly I suspect the author was not consciously creating the romantic connection between Kvothe and Bast. Maybe if I'd finished the book I would have found out that Kvothe was a gay man who masturbated to the memory of his mother. But I doubt it.END 2ND FOOTNOTE--> Kvothe declares that he will ""sum up"" a certain magical principle and begins with his ""first"" point. He then expounds upon that first point, but never reaches a second point, nor a third or fourth. The explanation merely peters out.--> Kvothe's father sets up a dichotomy between poetry and music that I don't believe exists. (I admit that's only a disagreement rather than a problem with the writing.)--> In several places there was a lack of creativity with turn of phrase. One passage uses the phrase ""there are times"" too many times.--> The author uses the definite article in a number of places were the indefinite article would have been more appropriate. In the passage I marked as an example, Kvothe talks about going ""deeper into the city"" without any prior mention of having entered any city, much less being on the verge of going deeper into it.--> In another place, a beautiful metaphor was ruined when the author spelled out his meaning explicitly. Some metaphors are more powerful if left implied, resting behind the words for the observant reader to find on his own. In this instance, it went from beautiful metaphor to so-so analogy.I also have a much more fundamental, underlying problem with the entire storyline. That is the quality of Kvothe as a character. He's portrayed as a superhuman hero with a towering intellect and dazzling physical prowess. Kvothe can do nothing wrong; no puzzle is too difficult and no problem too big to handle. He can thrive under any circumstance and no lady can resist his advances (neither can beautiful goat-men, for that matter). He wins over the most cynical skeptics and his knowledge of the arts and sciences is without equal. Kvothe advises kings and kills demons. He can even run a clean and comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Kvothe, himself, is his own story's deus ex machina. And that, to me, it is the ultimate expression of unimaginative writing. Supposedly Mr. Rothfuss wrote The Name of the Wind over the course of a decade or more. You'd think, with all that time to contemplate and mull over his book, he could come up with something more interesting than (ironically) ""The Most Interesting Man in the World.""",1.0

This book pulled me in from the beginning, to the point where I knew I'd found a favorite before I was halfway through. Here, Bardugo integrates a creative plot, interesting and morally grey characters, group dynamics and banter, a great writing style, and some really, really prime romance plots. Goddamn, can Leigh Bardugo write romance. There are very, very few books that I love so wholeheartedly. This series truly is my favorite fantasy series of all time. There's no competition whatsoever. PLOTTING AND WORLDBUILDINGBardugo tosses you right into the main plot from the beginning and keeps you engaged all the way through, even when her focus is on character work. Her plotting is incredibly engaging, with so many twists and turns that the book is hard to put down. This book focuses on mind games and clever plotting. The dregs need to have a thousand backup plans, and everything is brilliantly planned by Bardugo. The Grisha's worldbuilding is very engaging, even though we're thrown in without context; I remember thinking that I would have appreciated a proper map of Ketterdam, and then we GOT a good map in book two! Bardugo's prose is awesome, and there are some truly gorgeous quotes from here. Then again, it doesn't feel as if she's trying too hard or using purple prose. CHARACTER WORK OF PERFECTION
A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.
Bardugo nails character work here. Every single character grows, every single character develops, every single character owns my heart. okay maybe not Matthias quite as much but w/eInej is a member of a gang and a murderer, but she desperately wants to do the right thing and liberate slaves like herself. She's gone through hell and she's come out strong and in control. She feels so real on page; she has a heart but she only lets it out around the people she cares about. I like that combination. Kaz is the most manipulative, terrible, morally black protagonist I've ever read about, and I love him to pieces. He's absolutely an antihero; yes, he's on a mission to save the world, but does he care about saving the world? Nope, he cares about getting his cash. He still manages to be a complex, dimensional character, who genuinely cares about his friends not dying (though he'd never admit it). Jesper is witty and an absolute delight to get a POV chapter from, but he's also incredibly sympathetic as a former farm boy who fell from grace. He likes living on the edge, and he's aware of the pain his own actions have caused him, and he's trying to work through it. Nina is hilarious and idealistic and clever and can go from flirting to making speeches within ten seconds. She's such a great character because she's so earnest and positive despite everything that's happened to her. She's also one of the most badass characters ever.  Wylan doesn't actually have pov chapters here, but he's getting a shoutout from me anyway because of his pov chapters in CK. He's entertaining here, too, coming off as a blushing do-gooder but with rumor and intrigue swirling around his actual past. Matthias is honestly my least favorite. He's dynamic enough and he's got a great character arc, but I don't feel as if he's nearly as original a character as my five. Whatever, I still like him. BANTER AND DOING CHARACTER DYNAMICS RIGHTThe Dregs are such an amazing squad all together. Their banter owns my heart. Jesper and Inej especially have one of my favorite friendship dynamics of all time; their banter and their genuine trust in each other and their lowkey joking about their mutual crush on Kaz. Inej and Nina stand out as well; extra credit for passing the bechdel test with flying colors. Also, the dialogue here absolutely rules. You have no idea how many times I had to hold in laughter. 
“When we get our money, you can burn kruge to keep you warm,” said Kaz. “Let’s go.”Jesper consulted his compass, and they turned south. “I’m going to pay someone to burn my kruge for me.”Kaz fell into step beside him. “Why don’t you pay someone else to pay someone to burn your kruge for you? That’s what the big players do.”“You know what the really big bosses do? They pay someone to pay someone to …”
HOW TO WRITE ROMANCE: A GUIDEBOOK BY LEIGH BARDUGOSeriously, I felt the need to give this an entire section of its own, because the romance here is SO good. But the romance plots never overtake the book; I have an annotations list for these books, and there are twice as many good character moments and gorgeous quotes as there are romantic moments. Kaz and Inej are one of my all-time favorite book couples. I used to consider them my third favorite, but they've quickly become my favorite of all time. They have so many small moments and such slow-build romantic development. And then, as if I weren't invested already, they have that one declaration scene which honestly made me swoon. 
I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.
Jesper and Wylan are just cute for most of the book. They got some cute relationship build, but I wasn't that invested. And then that One Line at the end of the book shows up and they KILLED me. Really, Bardugo? You could've left me heart intact instead, but?? not so much. Also, side note, but I don't understand how anyone was surprised they're a thing in book two. I know heteronormativity is a thing that exists, but how can you read ""not just girls"" and mutual blushing in a heterosexual way? Matthias and Nina were honestly not that big a ship for me here. I absolutely understand what's appealing about their dynamic; they're sweet and have amazing relationship development. But they don't appeal to me personally; I don't have to lie down for twenty minutes when I read their scenes. DIVERSITY: YOUR FAVE COULD NEVERSomething that gets ignored a lot is how diverse this series is; not just in terms of nonwhite characters, lgbt characters, and badass girl characters, although it does have all of those. But Six of Crows also has some of the best rep of a disabled character EVER. It helps that this is ownvoices disability rep. Kaz' disability affects his life in a realistic way, and there's no magical cure for it, BUT he's still a huge badass and the disability never becomes a consuming part of his character!! There's also the fact that a chubby main character is portrayed as the most beautiful member of the group, while also not being reduced to her appearance. There's even a dyslexic character (in FANTASY!) and part of his character arc is learning that his learning difference doesn't make him stupid. There's a major character with ADD as well. This series handles emotional and physical trauma in the best way. Some of these characters have trauma and it's never portrayed as a detriment to who they are as people. It's an aspect of who they are as people, but their background never takes over their characters. It's a balance. Recovery is also portrayed in a great way; none of these characters can be ""fixed"" but that's okay. The entire topic is handled in a better way than most contemporaries that focus entirely on trauma. I appreciate it so much. TL;DR: I was never bored by this book, and I love the characters more than my own life. Highly recommended.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | YoutubeA Bunch of Random Spoilery Notes / CryingUPDATE: I actually got my mother obsessed with my favorite book? in related news I still have to lie down for 40 hours whenever Kaz and Inej interact// three chapters into reading this with my mother and she says ""it's official: I'm in love with Kaz"" and honestly if that isn't the mood for today• remember when we all thought Wylan had gotten kicked out for banging his tutor? is it even canonically confirmed that he didn't? i need answers• I BRed a second reread of this (yes, I've read it three times, shut up) with Amy, whose review you should definitely check out!!• every single moment of banter is my favorite but my underrated fave is probably ""If I see a single scratch or nick on those, I'll spell 'forgive me' on your chest in bullet holes"" and the ensuing debate over whether 'I'm sorry' would be better• ""Close your eyes!"" ""You can't kiss me from down there, Wylan.""• or maybe it's ""my ghost won't associate with your ghost"" • every time Kaz and Inej interact I have to lie down for 40 hours• Jesper and Wylan are probably angstier in this book than book 2?• I don't even understand how it's possible not to love this book. With most of my faves, I love them, but I get it if you don't love them. I flat-out don't understand how anyone could not love this book. It's a masterpiece.",5.0

215,How to Solve Your Own Murder,,3.86,"['March', '26,', '2024']","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0

How America stormed in and offered Columbia $$ to give Panama its independence. It wasn’t a selfless gesture, however, America wanted a canal for their own economic needs.This is a story of those who came to help build, resist the build and those to reclaim what was rightfully theirs. There are those who travelled from across the country and from across the sea.As much as I loved the intent of this story and the characters, it fell short for me. Henriquez created such marvellous characters yet, she failed on developing any of them through. We have a young Ada who travelled from Barbados to get a job to pay for her sister’s surgery; Omar who was looking more from his life, takes a job working in the canal that mutes his father speechless as he is shamed by it; Valentina ready to lead the town to protest the dam required for the canal; and so many other fascinating characters.The story did merge beautifully yet I was still left wanting: More of some characters, less of others; more of the impacts of the canal.Overall a solid 4⭐️",4.0
218,James,,4.61,"['March', '19,', '2024']","Whoa, that was so not was I was expecting. Despite the Goodreads blurb that calls this book “ferociously funny” and “brimming with electrifying humor,” I didn't really find much to laugh about while reading it. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was just surprised by how serious and thought-provoking this novel ended up being. I mean, sure, there are a few funny bits here and there, but I definitely wouldn't consider this to be a humorous book overall.But, with that said, James is a brilliant piece of fiction and I have once again been wowed by Percival Everett's talent. (As an aside, if you want to read a truly funny book by Everett, grab yourself a copy of The Trees. It's amazing.) Everett manages to stay true to the tone and style of 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
 while at the same time creating something completely different with runaway slave Jim as the narrator.This is not an easy book to read … well, subject-wise, anyway. Lots of terrible things happen to good people, mostly just because of the color of their skin. There are awful characters who degrade and take advantage of Jim just because they can. There is murder and rape and violence and death. I've read books about slavery before, but somehow this one brought home the inhumanity of it like no other. I foresee lots of challenges to this book by the “slavery wasn't really all that bad,” red hat-wearing, book-burning crowd.I flew through this book and found it basically unputdownable. I read the first 80% in one sitting, forced myself to go to bed around 3 a.m., and then finished the last bit first thing the next morning. It's exciting and suspenseful and heart-wrenching all at the same time, and the ending was fantastic.If you enjoyed the original Huck Finn, you'll probably love this version at least as much, if not more. Percival Everett is an incredibly talented author and a national treasure, and this latest book of his deserves all of the praise and recognition that will undoubtedly come its way.Many thanks to NetGalley and Doubleday for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0

The Book Review Crew Blog
3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent.

223,The Morningside,,3.68,"['March', '19,', '2024']","The Morningside by Téa Obreht is a Family and Literary Fiction Story Sprinkled With Magical Realism and Set in a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic World! 
Holy-Moly! There's a lot going on in this story...
Silvia knows little about where she's from, why they had to leave, or why her mother keeps their past so secretive. The only thing she knows is now they're living at The Morningside, an aging luxury high-rise in Island City where her Aunt Ena has lived and worked for the past ten years.  Silvia loves her conversations with Aunt Ena, who feeds her imagination with stories about the homeland she doesn't remember. Silvia becomes enamored by Ena's tales and her imagination spills over with thoughts about the mysterious resident living in the penthouse. She makes it her focus to discover the truth about this woman's life... The Morningside is a Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic story written in the first-person narrative of curious eleven-year-old Silvia. Silvia is quiet, bright, and observant and possesses keen senses for a child her age. Perhaps it's due to being raised by a mother who shares little that Silvia is driven to find answers on her own. Silvia meets two individuals she develops friendships with and it's through these connections the story becomes more about the characters and relationships and less about the changing world described in Obreht's lovely writing. The story can feel cramped with melodrama and distractions, jumping from one catastrophe to the next, and taking abrupt turns through unexpected decisions by the characters. For me, it added additional layers and interest.The Morningside is creative and original storytelling about a mother-daughter relationship, finding family, and discovering your place in the world. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a well-written character-driven Family and Literary Fiction story with touches of Magical Realism like I do. I plan to look at Téa Obreht's backlist for more to read while I wait for her next book!4⭐Thank you to Random House and Téa Obreht for a physical ARC, and a DRC of this book through NetGalley.

225,Becoming Madam Secretary,"She took on titans, battled generals, and changed the world as we know it…New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Dray returns with a captivating and dramatic new novel about an American heroine Frances Perkins.",4.49,"['March', '12,', '2024']","**Many thanks to Berkley and Stephanie Dray for an ARC of this book provided via NetGalley!**""Being a woman has only bothered me in climbing trees."" - Frances PerkinsIt is this frank and fearless nature that sets Frances Perkins apart...and from the moment she arrives in New York City, destined to bring about change, she truly has her work cut out for her. Working with some of the poorest in Hell's Kitchen's tenements, it is apparent that working conditions (and living conditions) are not sustainable for the people of her fair city. She has several compatriots, each with a fire for revolution in their bellies: there's Upton Sinclair, a cheeky young fire-haired writer who longs to be more than just friends with Frances, a wealthy but kind socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, and a brooding, sensitive young reformer Paul Wilson, each determined to change the landscape in their own way. But after witnessing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire firsthand (with workers literally LEAPING out of the burning building to the ground below), Frances knows that labor conditions need change: immediate and DRASTIC change. Though she isn't directly involved in politics herself, Frances gets word that Franklin ""Feather Duster"" Roosevelt, a rich and haughty man she encountered at a party once (who wasn't exactly her number one fan, to put it mildly!) is running for office...and he might actually WIN. Roosevelt has a plan that will take him up through the ranks, and quickly: a plan that will end with him in the White House. When all of this comes to pass, NO one is more surprised than Frances when FDR not only recognizes Frances' passion for reform and labor policy, but wants to appoint her to be his Secretary of Labor...making her the very FIRST woman in the presidential cabinet.Although Frances is honored and perhaps more passionate and driven by her work than anyone around her, she is met with push-back and criticism over and over again. Many men assume she can't do her job AND be a wife and mother...but Frances isn't going to let anything stand in her way. But balancing the severe troubles experienced by members of her family...acting as an indomitable force during FDR's tenure...AND fighting for social security and labor reform proves to be nearly overwhelming for Frances, and she starts to wonder if she can TRULY make all of these dreams come true. Will her bold determination start a blaze of glory that will continue on for generations to come...or will everything she has worked for crumble before her very eyes?I'm a bit ashamed to say that before picking up this book, I probably hadn't heard the name Frances Perkins since elementary school...and since this may have been back in the 2nd or 3rd grade I couldn't have told you a THING about her. After reading this book, it's not only shocking but saddening to me that such an integral part of history was not a MAJOR focus in the curriculum. As someone who is very passionate when it comes to workers' rights (and as a former Union member myself, when I had the opportunity to be in one!) it was easy for me to become VERY invested in Frances' mission as she fought to keep children out of factories, to enforce more limited working hours (No more fourteen hour days...and we think we have it bad now! ) and to establish programs like social security which would benefit ALL citizens, not just those born into wealth. Sadly, many of these fights persist today, but they would have been Dead on Arrival PERMANENTLY if not for the tireless work of Frances Perkins. To say this book is enlightening is an understatement: I feel I owe Frances a debt of gratitude!Dray also does something special with this narrative: this is technically historical fiction, but almost reads more like a diary or a memoir. Perkins takes you through so many years of her life, but the chapters are fairly short and manageable, and there is a solid balance between Perkins' work life and her personal life. There is romance and heartache, inner turmoil and also an exploration of the power of friendship. While Perkins and FDR have a rocky start, the two learn to work in tandem in a truly powerful way, and like all of the relationships explored here, has a complexity and a beauty all its own. Perkins' choices are never easy, and this is the recurring theme underlying her entire career. Being a woman during this time was hard enough in and of itself, but to make some of the 'radical' statements and decisions Perkins was forced to make at times was what set her apart...and I am SO thrilled Dray chose to share this history in such an interesting way.This book is also 500+ pages (!) which is usually somewhat of a red flag for me when it comes to historical fiction, but this one is written in such a way that it never feels overly long or complex. The chapters move along at a pretty good clip, and as a reader I felt that the only reason the book was this length was to make sure she captured as much detail about Perkins' life as possible: this one is meticulously researched, with Dray highlighting at the end any areas where she took creative liberty, but these are few and far between. There's always a stark difference between authors who TRULY do their research in historical fiction and those that rely on more 'basic' tropes and commonly known information. I applaud Dray's dedication to preserving the integrity of Frances Perkins and EVERYTHING she accomplished during her truly impactful time in office.And through Dray, by the end of her journey, Perkins makes an observation true of so many bold and brilliant, brave and breathtaking revolutionaries of the past, present, and future: ""So maybe a spark of madness is what it takes to accomplish anything truly revolutionary in this world.""One tiny, seemingly insignificant, but POWERFUL spark! 🔥 💪4 stars",4.0
226,The Inmate,,4.08,"['June', '13,', '2022']","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0

To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.",4.00,"['August', '13,', '2020']","I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.",2.0

You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's not that bad!!"" i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want to look at this, let alone read it.here's what i liked:this scene - ""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously be SPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."" ). No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.",1.0
229,Yellowface,"White lies. Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel.",3.80,"['May', '16,', '2023']","2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do. yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn't work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way. my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc. this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way. so many mouthpieces. i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing as framing and context which are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie, when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary. despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrative is juniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was, ‘…that’s it?’ i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says, ‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’ Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface. it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere. oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:  ""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""  but what happens after? we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we've seen the cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that it teases you with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assault edit 24/05/2023:  unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1) i am not white. i am asian,  2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired. in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about. 'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.' go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry. and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.",2.0

Why did I love it so much? Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style. Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus? The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.",5.0

This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over.

232,Daisy Jones & The Six,,4.21,"['March', '5,', '2019']","Yes! The series adaptation on Prime Video just released and it’s so far freaking good, especially the songs ! And here’s my review for this legendary novel of TJR! Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a captivating and emotional story that explores the rise and fall of a fictional 1970s rock band named The Six, as told through the eyes of their lead singer, Daisy Jones.The novel is written in an unconventional format, presented as a transcript of interviews with the band members, their friends, and family, as well as other individuals who were involved in the band's journey. This format is not only unique but also adds a sense of realism to the story, making the reader feel as though they are reading a true account of a band's rise to fame. The characters in Daisy and the Six are incredibly well-developed, with each member of the band having their own distinct personality and backstory. Daisy, in particular, is a compelling character, with her raw talent and rebellious spirit causing both admiration and friction among her bandmates. The novel's portrayal of the music industry in the 1970s is also fascinating, with the reader getting a glimpse into the excess and indulgence that came with fame during that era. The book's exploration of the band's creative process is also intriguing, as it delves into the complexities of writing and performing music.One of the strengths of Daisy and the Six is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader. The highs and lows of the band's journey are felt keenly, and the relationships between the characters are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.What makes Daisy and the Six such a compelling read is the way that Taylor Jenkins Reid captures the spirit of the 1970s music scene. The story is set against a backdrop of social and cultural change, and the author weaves these themes seamlessly into the narrative.The book is a love letter to rock and roll, and Jenkins Reid's passion for music shines through in every chapter. She expertly captures the excitement and energy of live performances, and the way that music can bring people together.But beyond the music, Daisy and the Six is also a deeply human story about love, loss, and the bonds that connect us. The relationships between the band members are complex and multifaceted, and the novel delves into the various conflicts and tensions that arise as a result.What's more, the book is also a commentary on the nature of fame and the toll that it can take on those who achieve it. The Six are catapulted to stardom almost overnight, and the pressure to maintain their success takes a heavy toll on the band members' personal lives.In conclusion, Daisy and the Six is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that will stay with readers long after they finish it. It's a must-read for anyone who loves music, drama, and unforgettable characters, and it's a testament to the enduring power of rock and roll.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
233,Listen for the Lie,What if you thought you murdered your best friend? And if everyone else thought so too?

The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
234,The Guest List,,3.82,"['February', '20,', '2020']","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy!

239,To Kill a Mockingbird,,4.26,"['July', '11,', '1960']","/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.",1.0
240,The Great Gatsby,The Great Gatsby,3.93,"['April', '10,', '1925']","Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with “some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life”, focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. 

Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¹ - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¹ I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.
Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
“voice is full of money”
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.

The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
“an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again”
.

This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? 

Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose voices are “full of money”, who are “gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor”, people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”



This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me now, almost a full century since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you. Five green-light stars in the fog at the end of a dock.——————Also posted on my blog.",5.0

It's ""Philosopher's Stone"" for me or no stones at all!01/12/2020 - 9%(1) ""People in cloaks! Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the getups you saw on young people!""- With the movies, it's easy to forget that everyday wizard attire involves brightly colored cloaks and pointy hats.(2) McGonagall: ""There will be books written about Harry – every child in our world will know his name!""01/13/2020 - 16%(1) Harry gets Dudley's second room, which seems very much like the Room of Requirement. It's used to hide Dudley's disused and broken things, but now functions as a bedroom.(2) If this snake was bred in captivity, and doesn't often speak to humans, how does it speak Portuguese? I suppose there's some Parseltongue iteration of Portuguese.01/14/2020 - 23%(1) Hagrid: ""'The gold ones are Galleons,' he explained. 'Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle.'""- It's interesting that despite UK decimalization, wizards still use a kind of £sd currency. They're sort of American that way: resisting metric.(2) A knut is a wizard penny, I presume after King Cnut the Great.01/15/2020 - 34%(1) Harry: ""What are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?""Hagrid: ""School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but–""Harry: ""I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,"" said Harry gloomily.""- Hufflepuff does sound like it's for stoners.(2) Ron's both shocked and impressed that Harry said ""Voldemort."" Sort of like cursing, uttering his name.01/16/2020 - 43%(1) ""Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. 'GRYFFINDOR!' shouted the hat. Ron groaned.""- And thus begins our enemies-to-lovers romance.(2) ""Ickle"" must be Britishism of Britishisms. I've only ever seen it in ""Harry Potter"" books.(3) Hope my GIFs are well-received. Let me know if they ever get annoying.01/17/2020 - 55%(1) ""The students all hated [Filch], and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.""- Well, as long as they don't actually kick the cat.(2) Re: Football: ""Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.""- I dislike soccer for separate, non-magical, reasons.01/18/2020 - 62%(1) Ron saves Hermione from the troll. When it comes to Hermione, Harry's invariably placid, it's always fireworks with Ron.(2) Before I knew better, I used to think ""Hermione"" was pronounced ""hermy-won.""(3) ""Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

This is money?'""- I guess heptagons aren't common among wizards.01/19/2020 - 69%(1) The problem with the library's ""restricted section"" is that anyone can go there. Just keep them locked in a separate room, there must be hundreds of those available.(2) Remembralls are about as useful as tying string around your finger.(3) Harry: ""How did you know – ?""Dumbledore: ""I don't need a cloak to become invisible.""- Totally pwned!01/20/2020 - 73%(1) “Ron and Hermione [were] playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.”- I agree, it keeps her humble and open to suggestions.- It’s good for Ron too, having something he’s best at.(2) I love how openly biased teachers are toward their houses. It makes them more human.01/21/2020 - 77%(1) Ron and Neville fist fight Malfoy, Crabbe & Goyle. If you ask me, Malfoy's Ron's nemesis not Harry's.(2) ""Hermione... had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes.

I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed.""- Not an awful idea, motives aside. Manacles can be handy.(2) ""Snape made them all nervous... while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.""- Trick question! Potion fumes might cause them to forget!01/23/2020 - 90%(1) The difference between J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan is that Rowling plays the long game, building scenes toward the climax. Whereas Riordan plays in short bursts, ping-ponging from one mini-quest to another. Here, for example, Ron being best at chess, Hagrid giving Harry a flute, Peeves being scared of the Bloody Baron, etc., all pay-off at the climax.01/24/2020 - 90%(1) Dumbledore: ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""- Wonder why Dumbledore doesn't give this advice to everyone? Surely people would listen.(2) Lost in the narrative is that Harry kills a guy. Literally kills him with the power of love... it's a curious thing.",4.0

FUCK, life is so full of crap.there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.journal entrytoday i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob & gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. ""i'm in a band""...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and it is terrible. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite ""classic"" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!journal entrytoday i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never ""complete you"". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or ""challenging"". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so....""human"", i guess.journal entrytoday i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, that is not me. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.journal entrytoday i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.journal entrytoday i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a ""leader""? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?",5.0
244,The Hunger Games,"Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?",4.34,"['September', '14,', '2008']","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.  
Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
“But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.  And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
 * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 

 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue... Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose death scene brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness. I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*",4.0
245,The Handmaid’s Tale,,4.14,"['January', '1,', '1985']","06/24/22These are dark times…..‘I just don’t like her.’ ‘I heard she has a lot of emails.’ ‘But I really love Bernie! If I can’t have Bernie, I’m not voting for HER… I’m going to vote my conscience!’ Elections matter. This draconian decision overturning Roe endangers every woman of child baring age, and it’s just the beginning. This decision is not about life, it’s about controlling women. As racist as this country is, it’s much more misogynistic. Don’t believe me? Barack Obama.By not voting for Hillary Clinton, whatever your reasoning, you (each of you) put lives of these women in danger. You are responsible for their deaths. It’s that straight forward. But, I understand you were misled. This does not have to stand! You have all the power and can redeem yourselves! You HAVE to vote Democratic up and down the ballot in the midterms this fall, and in every election going forward. Just two more Democratic senators is all that is needed to kill the filibuster and codify Roe into federal law.The first thing that must be done in 2023, after the Democrats control the house and the senate (because, this time you listened to me) … is to expand the court. Also, impeach those idiots that were put in by a criminal president.Pregnancy is dangerous. Women die from pregnancy. This is a healthcare issue.Vote. Vote blue. Every time. You know better, now do better.05/03/22Well, well, well….A heartfelt ‘fuck you’ to everyone who said I was over reacting in November 2016. Expand the court!Kill the filibuster!VOTE BLUE!09/01/21RE: Texas (AKA Gilead)Told you so…so many times. I could go on, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Rich, white, women will ALWAYS be able to get abortions BTW. It’s about women’s bodily sovereignty and about the men who are salivating at the thought of controlling us. Now let’s air lift EVERYTHING with a vagina out of Texas.I don’t see a difference between Republicans and the Taliban; Do you?#KillTheFilibuster #ExpandTheCourt 02/13/21Today 43 Republicans, traitors to their country, worried about losing their jobs decided against growing a pair. Portman in Ohio who isn't running for re-election is the portrait of cowardice. He could have voted guilty, but he didn't. Moscow Mitch voted 'not guilty' then immediately turned around to make a speech about how guilty Donald is for inciting the insurrection! You can't have it both ways, Mitch! Why did he vote 'not guilty?' Because of process... one can't hold a trial for a president for his crimes after he's out of office for crimes he committed while in office (yet, a president can't be held responsible for his crimes whilst in office)... But, between January 6th and the 20th, Mitch shut down the senate and refused to call the senate back to hold the trail, when according to him, would have been the appropriate time to hold the trial. All of which is entirely bullshit. Donald was impeached while he was still in office so it was entirely appropriate (required, actually) to put him on trial after he left office. My head hurts.Someone please stuff lettuce in Mitch's mouth and turn him on his shell.01/06/21Sadly, it’s time for an update. In this book, Gilead took control of the United States government via a violent coup in which they kill all the members of congress at the capitol. Then martial law was enacted. Carry on.5/22/19Looking back on my original review, it reads as quaint compared to the draconian state laws recently being passed, my state of Ohio being one of them. Make no mistake, this not about ‘life’ it’s about controlling women. If you can’t decide what happens to your own body you do not have freedom. This is about bodily autonomy. Women have the RIGHT to legal and safe abortions with no qualifications. The fact that the narrative has gone to ‘in cases of rape and incest’ is troubling. Rape...incest...life of the mother....horrible birth defects....you’re young, single and not ready....you have five kids and can’t afford more, it doesn’t matter! This is a medical procedure and pregnancy is a risky condition, it can cause death. Every woman has the right to decide whether or not they want to take that risk. Period.Men don’t have anything that compares to this. No law is forcing them have vasectomies, or even denying them their bonner pills.7/7/17 I'm just going to leave this here.... fuck Paul Ryan.... but not literally, ew. Sleeveless women?

When the Religious Right came into power, they began to put into practice their insane beliefs which strip women of their identity, their rights, their body, their very name. Women are to be called Of(whatever asshat they belong to), instead of, say Beatrix. Reproduction is an issue because all the toxins in the environment have rendered many women infertile. But if you are fertile, woe to you, you get to be a baby factory against your will, get promised to some jerk you don’t love or even like because someone deemed him important enough to breed. Oh, come on!This book was written in 1986, FYI. I thought it was scary and sort of possible when I first read it, but farfetched. This could NEVER happen in the United States of America. Never would it be allowed to happen here, we are too educated.So………I turn on the news (in twothousandandfrikntwelve) and certain religious factions on the right are trying to defund Planned Parenthood, because they perform abortions which is only 3% of what they do (with NO federal $ going towards them). Mostly PP provides healthcare to women who wouldn't get it otherwise………..icky poor women. Now it’s birth control? Seriously? Birth control??????? Did I wake up in 1950? Am I stuck in a Atwood novel? 98% of Catholic women (technically I’m one of them) use/used birth control. Even they are asking WTF? I’m not sure what these people are trying to do. There are more women than men and we vote……unless that’s the next right on the chopping block.------------------------------------------------------------There have several updates to this review that I have removed to make room for the next. what follows is the most recent one. ------------------------------------------------------------It’s been nearly a week since the unimaginable happened and I had to let the shock wear off before I could put a coherent, non-rage filled update on this review. Not that I don’t have rage, I have plenty to spare, but I think it’s now at a level that is manageable enough for me not to just type out a string of obscenities. That being said… Update 11/14/16: An unqualified, racist, xenophobic, sexist, pathological liar, psychopathic reality star was elected to be the 45th president of the United States and the leader of the free world. FUCK!The United States has officially shat the bed. Few foresaw it, but in hindsight, it was coming down the road for a very long time. The United (divided) States voted for Hillary Clinton on whole (popular vote) by over 2,000,000 votes and counting (millions are still out in California, for example), yet Donald Trump is our president elect (gag) due to an antiquated electoral college system (which I could explain, but I’m not because Google can do that better than I can.) Now, I’m all for ditching the electoral college, unless the electors decide to do what it was intended to do under this circumstance; to save us from ourselves. See, our founding fathers knew that we would fall for some con artist, demagogue at some point in the future, so they wisely created the electoral college, a group of actual human beings trusted upon to stop such a calamity. I implore the folks of current electoral college recognize this election as a collective loss of sanity of less than a quarter of the population of this nation, and on December 19th put their votes towards the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton. I realize that this is unlikely, but one can dream.How did this happen? There are many factors involved. Lots of opportunity for pointing fingers and fighting amongst ourselves, which I will admit to being a party to…..guilty. But, in my opinion, what it boils down to is these four things: Division, misinformation, apathy and fear of the ‘other’. Division: We are all in our own comfortable bubbles, digesting the information we are most comfortable with. For example, I never believed there was this much hate it this country because I didn't want to look at it; I knew it was there of course, but not at the level that it appears to be. Everyone wants to live where they feel they belong. Amongst those that are like minded and reaffirm your very rightness. Liberals don’t want to live in Indiana (or Ohio….sigh) any more than a conservative want’s to live in Washington state. We even do this in our social media as well (guilty again). This is what messed us up with the electoral college. Misinformation: I am not going to tell you who’s right or wrong here, I’ll let this study speak for itself.Apathy: Half…HALF… the country didn’t vote. You guys suck.Fear of the other: This country harbors more racism than I can comprehend. The white people in this country seemed a little angry about the black man in the white house and the white men were staunchly determined not to have a woman (white or not) follow him. I don’t mean all white men, just too many of them (chill.) “The advantage for Trump among men is larger than the 7-point advantage Romney had in 2012 and much different than in 2008, when men preferred Obama over McCain by a single point.”-PewResearchCenter. But then there are the white women, 53% went for Trump…..oh my sisters, I have no words.Which brings me to the reason why this update is relevant to this review and to this book (for those who tell me that my opinion is unwarranted....again.) Is the United States a more racist country, or a more sexist country? America has spoken, at least the ones who cared to speak, and the answer is “a goodly amount of both”, but in this election sexism won and women lost.",5.0
246,The Alchemist,,3.91,"['January', '1,', '1988']","It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting. The Alchemist ~~  Paulo CoelhoI preface my review by saying I am amazed how wildly passionate people are in their feelings toward this novel ~~ regardless of whether they love or hate  The Alchemist. I’m one of those people who love it. But, I understand why people are so passionate in their dislike of this work.  Paul Coelho looks to inspire passion in people with The Alchemist. And he succeeds in doing so ~~ especially in those who are so passionate in their dislike of this book. The Alchemist is a novel that combines an atmosphere of medieval mysticism with the voice of the desert -- dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure follow Santiago and the reader like echoes of ancient wise voices. With this symbolic novel Coelho states that we should not avoid our destinies, and urges people to follow their dreams, because to find our ""Personal Myth"" and our mission on Earth is the way to find God, meaning happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate purpose of creation.The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who has a dream and the courage to follow it. After listening to ""the signs"" the boy ventures in his personal, journey of exploration and self-discovery, searching for a hidden treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt. In his journey, Santiago sees the greatness of the world, and meets all kinds of exciting people like kings and alchemists. However, by the end of the novel, he discovers that ""treasure lies where your heart belongs"", and that the treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made, and the wisdom he acquired.As the alchemist himself says when he appears to Santiago in the form of an old king ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's theme. Isn't it true that all of us want to believe the old king when he says that the greatest lie in the world is that at some point we lose the ability to control our lives, and become the pawns of fate. Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their “Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment. Fear, fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness. The old crystal-seller tragically confesses: “I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream"". This is where Coelho really captures the drama of man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies doing so, and ends up living an empty shell of a life.  The Alchemist is a novel that will not appeal to everybody. Not everyone will identify with Santiago. We all have dreams, and are praying for somebody to tell us they can come true. The novel skillfully combines words of wisdom, philosophy, and simplicity of meaning and language, and this is what makes it so enchanting.",5.0
247,Pride and Prejudice,,4.29,"['January', '28,', '1813']","➸ 4 stars 

“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun.”

— pride and prejudice by jane austen stands as a pinnacle of english literature, enchanting readers for over two centuries with its timeless tale of love, societal expectations, and personal growth. set in the genteel world of regency-era england, the story follows the spirited elizabeth bennet as she navigates the complexities of courtship, marriage, and social hierarchy. central to the story is elizabeth’s tempestuous relationship with the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, whose initial aloofness belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually wins elizabeth’s heart.one of my resolutions this year was to step out of my comfort zone and explore classic literature, and since i absolutely adore pride and prejudice (2005), i decided to start with this book. after reading this story, i can now comprehend why “pride and prejudice” has captured the hearts of so many over the years with its wit, social insight and timeless romance makes it a captivating read. i’m not sure why it wasn’t a 5 star read for me, but i think that the slow start made it a bit challenging, it was until volume three where i started to really enjoy the story.➷ austen’s language was, at first, bit of a challenge. while her prose is beautiful and rich, sometimes i would have to go back to reread a chapter to understand what was happening. but that’s just a me issue since i’m not really used to reading classics and i had to keep reminding myself this book was written over 200 years ago. but as the story progresses you can see how the writing is eloquently beautiful. watching the 2005 movie so many times definitely helped me understand everything better. 

“a lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”

➳ elizabeth bennett:elizabeth is such a strong fmc. she takes no nonsense from anyone and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. what makes elizabeth captivating is her unwavering sense of integrity and her refusal to compromise her principles, even in the face of pressure from her family and society. she is not willing to settle for a loveless marriage or a life of luxury if it means sacrificing her own happiness and autonomy. throughout the story, elizabeth faces numerous challenges and obstacles, from her family’s financial struggles to the pressures of societal expectations. yet, she navigates these difficulties with grace and resilience, never compromising her principles or sacrificing her sense of self. she had a tendency to be judgemental throughout the book. she quickly forms opinions about people based on limited information or first impressions. for example, she initially perceives mr. darcy as proud and arrogant, partly influenced by negative rumours that mr. wickham told her. but as the story goes on, she learns that maybe she shouldn’t be so quick to judge. — i absolutely adored her relationship with her sister, jane. they both share a special sisterly bond that is central to the story. throughout the book, they confide in each other, offer advice, and provide emotional comfort during times of joy and distress. their tight-knit bond stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, providing unwavering support and understanding. together, they navigate the complexities of society and matters of the heart, offering each other comfort and guidance along the way.➳ fitzwilliam darcy:「 ”dearest and loveliest elizabeth” 」opposite elizabeth bennet stands the brooding and enigmatic mr. darcy, a wealthy and reserved gentleman hailing from a noble lineage. initially shrouded in arrogance and reserve, darcy’s facade belies a depth of character and integrity that gradually unfolds throughout the narrative. at the beginning of the story, he is seen as arrogant and dismissive, particularly in his interactions with the bennet family. his reluctance to engage in social situations and his propensity to make quick judgments about others contribute to his unfavorable reputation. while undeniably flawed, darcy’s journey is marked by a profound transformation—one of the most compelling arcs in the story. despite his pride and acute awareness of social status, darcy emerges as a fundamentally good man, grappling with his own prejudices and ultimately learning to open his heart to love. through his struggles and growth, darcy embodies the novel’s central themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the transformative power of genuine connection.꒰ mr. darcy + elizabeth: ꒱they are the true heart of this story. the romance between mr. darcy and elizabeth bennet is a slow-burn journey that unfolds gradually throughout this book. at the outset, elizabeth is put off by darcy’s perceived arrogance and social status, while darcy is equally dismissive of elizabeth’s lower social standing and outspokenness. darcy’s letter to lizzy is a pivotal moment that shifts the dynamics of their relationship. it’s a sincere attempt by darcy to address the misunderstandings between them and explain his actions. through the letter, darcy opens up about his past and motivations, revealing a more complex and vulnerable side of himself. for lizzy, it’s a moment of reckoning, as she grapples with the new insights into darcy’s character and her own feelings towards him.darcy: i love you even though you’re poor, your family have no etiquette and they suck, but idc will you marry me?? lizzy: no like this will never not be funny!! she left that man flabbergasted, like what did he expect her to say after just insulting her and her family 😭

”in vain i have struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you.”

— overall, this book remains a timeless classic, cherished for it’s witty dialogue, memorable characters and enduring themes. it’s not just a romance but also a sharp critique of societal norms and expectations. through the journey of characters like elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy, jane austen offers timeless lessons about prejudice, self-discovery, personal growth and the power of love. it’s a book that is still adored and continues to resonate with readers generations later. ───♡─────────────in my classics era",4.0
248,The Da Vinci Code,,3.92,"['March', '18,', '2003']","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
249,The Kite Runner,,4.34,"['May', '29,', '2003']","Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.",1.0

251,Lord of the Flies,,3.69,"['September', '17,', '1954']","Kids are evil. Don't you know?I've just finished rereading this book for my book club but, to be honest, I've liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school. Overall, Lord of the Flies doesn't seem to be very popular, but I've always liked the almost Hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures. Make the characters all angel-faced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have? Just your average high school drama, but set on a desert island. With a bit more bloody murder. But not that much more.In 1954, when this book was published, Britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand - that it is not, in fact, the centre of the universe, and the British Empire was not a thing of national pride, but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings. Much of British colonialism had been justified as a self-righteous mission to educate and modernise foreign ""savages"". So when put into its historical context, alongside the decolonisation movements, this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white, Western supremacy. Of course, to a modern reader there's a lot of racism in this book. The racial aspect is a big factor. Golding establishes from the very first page that Ralph is a perfect white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, private school boy. And Piggy even asks ""Which is better - to be a pack of painted n*****s like you are or to be sensible like Ralph is?"" I'm not going to argue with anyone's interpretation, but I think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism. For me, I always saw it as Golding challenging the notion of savages being dark-skinned, uneducated people from rural areas. With this book, he says screw that, I'll show you savages! and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and gold-plated upbringing.I think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says 
""I should have thought that a pack of British boys - you're all British, aren't you? - would have been able to put up a better show than that.""
 Golding's way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it.Some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book, but I don't think that's true. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel - namely, the failure of democracy and the pro-authority stance - but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach. Plus, anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination. The fascinating thing about Lord of the Flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries. You could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative Jack Merridew as a kind of Hitler (or other dictator) who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest. Dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos... we do not have to assume that Golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil, only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations.Still a fascinating book after all these years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0

Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind!

Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters",5.0
253,How to Solve Your Own Murder,,3.86,"['March', '26,', '2024']","Sometimes when the premise is really good, maybe there's just nowhere better for the story to go.When Frances was a teenager, she receives a bone-chilling fortune that she'll be murdered one day. She then spends the rest of her life trying to prevent it. But lo and behold, 60 years later, murder comes for her. Now it's up to her great-niece Annie to find the killer and earn her inheritance.You have to admit, that's a pretty darn interesting premise. And the title certainly plays it up. In fact, I think this might just be one of the most eye-catching titles I've ever come across. So of course straight to the top of my TBR pile it goes. I couldn't wait to dig in.And initially, I was hooked. I just love all the possibilities when you're starting a new mystery. Especially here because Annie is also looking into the disappearance of Frances' best friend Emily, so we're really getting a twofer for the price of one. The story's certainly not shy about casting suspicions this way, then that way. There's an interesting list of characters, all of whom could be friend or foe. It was a delightful start in the way that only cozy mysteries can be.But then slowly and surely, I started becoming less excited. For one thing, when it came to the characters and the way they interact, there's something a little off about it all. It was stilted and contrived, as if every character was playing a part and knew it. The dialogue lacks that natural volleying back and forth that's essential to being authentic, often leaving me feeling like I'm just reading a bunch of non sequiturs. It's as if the author wanted certain results from each scene and kind of forced the dialogue and interactions to achieve it.The other thing is that I had a lot of trouble keeping all the characters straight. We have two timelines, and some characters appear in one and some in both. But since Annie isn't a direct descendent of Frances, but rather her great-niece, I started losing track of all the different branches of the family tree and everyone's spouses and children, along with their relationships to each other. It was really confusing.As for the mystery itself, honestly, that fell short for me too. I'm not expecting Agatha Christie (really, no one can reach the great dame), but when a book compares itself to Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club, I have certain expectations. And this didn't really meet that, not even close. It feels like there were all these clues and then they just didn't really go anywhere. And the final solution didn't wow me so much as leave me vaguely puzzled, and I'm still not sure I understood how it all went down.It's never good when a mystery ends in puzzlement rather than amazement. No doubt cozy mystery aficionados will find this a worthy read, but for everyone else, the jury's still out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",3.0
254,Murder Road,A young couple find themselves haunted by a string of gruesome murders committed along an old deserted road in this terrifying new novel.,3.79,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Simone St. James delivers another solid SUPERNATURAL thriller, which might just raise the hairs on your arms…and it’s NOW AVAILABLE! Happy publication day!! “If You See Her, You”ll Be The Next One Dead On The Side of the Road” July 1995: Eddie and April are newlyweds heading to a cabin for their honeymoon-part of a hotel on the shore of Lake Michigan. They had scrimped and saved and had been able to book five nights, planning to swim, BBQ burgers, drink beer, play scrabble and go to bed. Repeat five times and then head home to Ann Arbor where they would go to work all day, come home at five, have a sandwich together, go to bed, and repeat again, forever and ever, secure in their marital bliss. But, something along the way, made Eddie take a wrong turn onto Atticus Line, a dark, deserted strip of road that has taken the lives of several hitchhikers over the past nineteen years, the first occurring in 1976. Then, in the beam of their headlights, they saw a figure walking that appeared to need help, and stopping will change EVERYTHING. Rhonda Jean isn’t drunk- she is bleeding-and although they rush her to the hospital in ColdLake Falls, when she dies, they somehow become “suspects” instead of the Good Samaritans they are! Caught up in the mystery, of the original Jane Doe found, dubbed “The Lost Girl”, -they try to clear their names, but when they see her, they have to wonder if she IS just an urban legend ?! WILL ONE (OR BOTH) BECOME HER NEXT VICTIM? Fortunately, they will have the help of Rose, the proprietor of the B &B they are placed in by local Police, and Beatrice and Gracie Snell, two resourceful teenaged sisters who are better sleuths than the detectives in charge. Full of fun 90’s nostalgia, and several eerie, ominous car rides-you will want to scream at Eddie and April whenever they venture back onto Atticus Line. Just 👀 look at that gorgeous cover of the oncoming headlights on the desolate MURDER ROAD! Then, as I flipped the pages on my Kindle, there was a dark line beneath each numbered chapter, which seemed to move as you reached the first page of every chapter-reminding me of the rhythmic flash of dashed lines you see dividing two lanes on highway at night as you speed past! Creepy! If you have enjoyed the author’s work in the past, you don’t want to miss this one! 4.5 ⭐️  Thank You to Berkley for the very early gifted copy provided through NetGalley.

256,The New Couple in 5B,A couple inherits an apartment with a spine-tingling past in this binge-worthy thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of Secluded Cabin Sleeps Six.,3.67,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Wow! ""666 Park Avenue"" meets ""Rosemary’s Baby"" with spine-tingling supernatural vibes! Lisa Unger takes us on another heart-throbbing journey into the paranormal and psychological thriller realm, transporting us to a claustrophobic residence in Manhattan. Here, murders, suicides, and jaw-dropping scandals haunt the place along with its creepy occupants, including an extra-creepy doorman who seems like he never sleeps, always watching and listening. Welcome to Windermere, a haven for creative souls such as artists, writers, performers, and, of course, sensitive occultists like mediums and astrologers. These eccentric inhabitants have lived in the same location for decades, appearing at least twenty years younger than their actual ages, prompting theories about possible vampiric tendencies. But I won't give away any spoilers; you'll have to read to test my far-fetched, silly theory!Enter the happy yet financially struggling couple, Rosie and Chad Lowan, who hit the jackpot when they inherit Chad’s late uncle Ivan’s Windermere apartment. However, Ivan’s only daughter Lana is far from pleased, appearing at their apartment out of nowhere, throwing threats to sue them and casting doubt on Chad's innocence. Despite the initial challenges, Rosie sees the positive side: a $5 million apartment and the opportunity to interview her new neighbors about the dark history of Windermere, becoming the subject of her new true crime novel. The Park Avenue residence, with its grisly murders, suicides, and terrible accidents, becomes the backdrop for Rosie's investigation. The history of the building, its unique architecture, and the fact that it was built on the site of a burned-down church all captivate Rosie like a moth to a flame.However, as they move in, Rosie senses that Windermere has its own sinister soul, slowly penetrating her skin. She keeps seeing a young boy who disappears when she turns her back, and the doorman, Abi, seems to know everything about their lives, even daring to lie to make Rosie question her sanity. Sudden deaths around them make Rosie question her past life, having run away from occultist parents who believed she had powers to see the future and other entities that nobody could conjure up. As the thin veil between reality and illusion fades away, Rosie realizes that nobody close to her is as innocent as they seem. Moving into Windermere might put her life in danger. Can she run without looking back? Can she save herself? The occult vibes, including devil eye pendants, astrology seances providing insight into the Taurus sign, ghostly appearances, and a family of dreamers and healers, hooked me easily. This riveting page-turner with multiple ongoing incidents keeps you on your toes, pushing you to make sense of it all. There's an ongoing murder investigation, unexplainable incidents in Windermere, and thankfully, the reasoning behind all these events is explained as rationally as possible, avoiding far-fetched and clichéd revelations. The only thing that bugged me a little was the dragging ending, which rubbed me the wrong way. It was still tragic, but I wished Rosie’s character could be more rational as a talented, investigative true crime author. That's why I deducted one star from my rating, even though I fell in love with the gothic atmosphere and the meeting of occult vibes with paranormal elements. I'm giving it four stars, and I have to admit my heartfelt gratitude to dear Lisa Unger for sending me a physical and signed copy of her new creation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm looking forward to reading her next works in the near future.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

258,Good Half Gone,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The WivesIris Walsh saw her twin sister, Piper, get kidnapped—so why does no one believe her?",3.50,"['March', '19,', '2024']","I've always adored Tarryn Fisher’s creative dark side, even when she was writing dark romance novels. Lately, she has chosen a path to work on twisty thrillers, some of which I truly enjoyed, such as “The Wives” and “Honest Lie”. Unfortunately, “The Wrong Family” was a miss for me.My expectations were so high before starting this novel, and I prayed to the thriller angels that it would be a hit. Thankfully, my prayers were answered. Especially the last twist made me scream “no freaking way”—it was an amazing touch! Well done, Fisher! This is a gripping psychological thriller with shades of Shutter Island, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and Sound of Freedom. It hooks you from the first page and keeps you on your toes till the end. You barely breathe, questioning so many puzzle pieces, including where is Piper, what really happened to her, and how Shoal Island Hospital is the final piece of the puzzle. What is the thin veil between reality and madness?Enter Iris Walsh, in her early twenties, raising her 8-year-old son Calvin with the help of her eccentric and lovable grandmother—a former stripper, librarian, caretaker, mother of a drug addict, and guardian of twins.Iris cannot get through the day when she was fifteen, witnessing her twin sister Piper’s kidnapping in front of a movie theater. The officers didn’t want to believe her, thinking her sister had run away, but she never gave up on her. Nearly a decade later, she graduates from school to be an intern at Shoal Island Hospital because the monster who hurt her sister might be one of the violent patients there. But what if she's wrong? What if she's about to punish an innocent guy, or worse, put her life in danger to become the next prey of a very brutal man?She finds herself developing a crush on Dr. Leo Grayson, who acts extra helpful and flirty around her. This might solve the problem of reaching the secluded unit where the monster gets treatment, but what if mixing her vendetta with her blooming romance puts more lives at risk? Could she finish the job she's planned for so long and bring justice for her sister by finding out what happened to her?This is one of my fastest, extra riveting, and exciting reads that I devoured in one sitting. So much happens in a short time that I had a hard time absorbing each thrown curveball, but it was still a well-executed winner that I truly enjoyed.Many thanks to NetGalley and Harlequin Trade Publishing/ Graydon House for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

260,The Princess of Las Vegas,,3.59,"['March', '26,', '2024']","This had a very strong start that quickly became bogged down by a dumb as a box of rocks MC, and an unrealistic foster child who is a brilliant child prodigy. The crypto currency and mobster side plots bored me to tears. The direction the book would take was telegraphed from the beginning: A Princess Di look-alike who has a residency in Las Vegas? A sister who looks just like her, who gets involved in a shady cryptocurrency deal? Predictable, but the ending was so convoluted my eyes glazed over. This was a buddy read with Marialyce, and sadly, not one we’d recommend.",2.0
261,The Unquiet Bones,"A shocking discovery of human bones reopens an almost fifty-year-old cold case—and rips apart the lives of a group of friends—in a riveting novel by Loreth Anne White, the Amazon Charts and Washington Post bestselling author of The Maid’s Diary.",4.23,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Too Many Characters3.5 stars “Our lives are written into our bones.”The Unquiet Bones  is a mystery about the remains of a body found buried under a chapel at a ski resort connected to a 15-year-old girl who went missing 47 years ago.47 years ago, Annilese Jansen went missing after attending a party. Her immediate friends are thrown into the spotlight, and the media dubs them the Shoreview Six.In the present, bones are recovered under a chapel in the woods. Sergeant Jane Munro is assigned the case. Jane, who is 6 months pregnant, is also going through a trauma as her fiance went missing 6 months ago.MANY POVs are included , including all 6 members of the Shoreview Six: Rocco, Jill, Cara, Bob, Mary, and Claude. In addition, there is Jane’s POV, Annilese’s sister, a journalist, and about three to four others. Some POVs are shared late in the game, while others are steady throughout. Because there are so many characters, it is hard to connect, as their POVs are limited. Some only share one chapter, but Jane, Angela, and various members of the Shoreview Six dominate. I had trouble keeping track of who was who, and the many characters overcomplicated the simple plot. The timeline alternates between the present and 1976. In addition to the mystery of the bones and Annalise’s disappearance, there is also the mystery of another high school student who disappeared at the same time as Annalise. The mystery behind Jane’s missing fiance isn't resolved, and I can see her showing up in another book.The mystery is intriguing, but the pacing is slow. I was a little bored in the beginning due to the number of characters, and it takes time for the plot to move, but the pace eventually builds, as does the tension. The final chapters and reveal are difficult and uncomfortable to read and made me sick to my stomach (see the TW below). The ending is impactful and left me a little shaken. Overall, this book does come together, but it would have made more of an impact with fewer characters and more development.

The Book Review Crew Blog
3.5 StarsThis book was pretty good and very unique. I am not a big science fiction fan but speculative fiction floats my boat so I thought I’d give this a try and I am glad I did. What an imagination Kira Peikoff has.Told from multiple points of view, my favourite format, Baby X is about the future of DNA, embryos and science that goes too far. The pacing of the book had me frantically turning pages as I wanted to find out what would happen next. I thought for sure I would be bored to tears with the scientific terminology but Peikoff kept it interesting and didn’t make me feel stupid. (She has a master’s in bioethics) Not all the characters are likeable but there are ones to cheer for and I liked getting each person’s perspective because I felt like I got to know them from the inside.Three and a half stars is a decent book and I did enjoy most of it even though I figured out one of the twists. BUT…towards the finish there is another twist and I didn’t see it coming and I loved the way everything and everyone came together at the end. It did get a bit over the top but I am going to let it slide because it is speculative. I am going to round up (which I rarely do) because it was just so damn entertaining, it surprised me, it was a fast, easy read and I like popcorn thrillers to a certain extent. I ain’t mad I read it!",4.0
263,The Angel of Indian Lake,The final installment in the most lauded trilogy in the history of horror literature,4.34,"['March', '26,', '2024']","The Angel of Indian Lake is the final book in the Indian Lake Trilogy. It's also my most anticipated release of 2024.I finished this a week ago and have been sitting with my thoughts ever since. I find myself thinking of the story at random times during the day, and trying to decide how I would explain my overall experience with this trilogy.I really haven't come up with anything that I think serves it justice. At this point, I've come to terms with the fact that this is just one of those 5-star reads that I may never end up writing a full, thoughtful, and analytical review for.It simply is what it is. I love this series with my whole heart. It's special to me, because in a way, I feel like this series validates my passion for the crazily nuanced genre of Horror.Stephen Graham Jones is such a talented storyteller. His nostalgic, yet edgy-style, brings a distinct voice to his stories, while also bringing heart and emotion. We swoon.While I recognize this trilogy won't be for everyone, for the people it is for, for the people it resonates with, it's truly a gift. My heart hurts that it's over. Is this really the last time I'm going to spend with these characters I love?I know I can read it again and again, as I do with my favorite King books, but still, I'm going to miss them nevertheless. SGJ is clearly a life-long Horror lover, a student of the genre, and someone that can tell one hell of a story.I'd love to hang out with him around a campfire...I highly recommend this series to Horror Readers. Particularly to Horror Readers who have been turning to the genre their whole life for comfort and to face fears. Perhaps you'll see a little of yourself in here too.Also, coincidentally, I did happen to rewatch Scream III while reading this and loved coming upon Randy's rules for Slasher Trilogies, which definitely could be applied here. It was great to hear those again from him whilst reading this. So perfect. We love making beautiful Horror connections!!Thank you so much to the publisher, Saga Press, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I already can't wait to read this one again!",5.0

This one is very dark and disturbing. I thought all the characters were very well done. The parents went through so much. My heart ached for them. It just broke my heart. OMG!

Who is digging? Who is dead? Fun start! Then we flash back to three months earlier where we meet Eve Bennett, who is putting on a pair of black JIMMY CHOO stiletto pumps to go to her job teaching high school math (lol) and thinking about how hot her husband Nate is compared to her... and also how much she hates him because they never fuck anymore. Nate also teaches at the high school - English - and is the hottest hottie hot hot teacher at the school, based on a list made by the senior girls that another faculty member knew about and then shared with Eve? The next chapter is from Addie's perspective. She's a junior, and everyone at school hates her because last year there were rumors she had a relationship with her math teacher, Arthur Tuttle (who is decidedly NOT a hottie hot hot teacher as he evidently resembles Santa?), while he was tutoring her and ""ruined his life"". Eve doesn't like Addie because Arthur is the nicest man ever and could *never* do such a terrible thing. Because that's 100% how the world works. Men who seem nice could never, ever be predators. Duh. Addie gets bullied a bunch by a girl named Kenzie Montgomery - a popular cheerleader who is also (supposedly, but as it turns out way later is NOT) dating Addie's old BFF, Hudson Jankowski. Hudson was Addie's only friend for years - they both had drunk dads and not much money - but then Hudson got swole and started playing football and is now super popular.Anyway, Eve is PISSED because Addie the Santa Destroyer is in her math class and she's going to have to teach her even though she has a ""terrible feeling about this girl."" She drowns her sorrows by going to a shoe store at the mall and thinking about stealing some LOUBOUTINS because it wouldn't be a FMcF book without the word LOUBOUTINS in it at least once, but then she doesn't steal the LOUBOUTINS and goes home and tries to bone Hot Nate, but he's not into it, so they eat some pasta instead. Everyone in this book eats A LOT of pasta.Addie hates math and is not happy to be in mean Eve's class, but she's super jazzed because she's also in Hot Nate's English class and Hot Nate loves poetry and Addie writes poetry and he also writes poetry and he loves Edgar Allan Poe and she also loves Edgar Allan Poe and OMG!!!!!!!!! Addie writes a poem and Hot Nate LOVES it and wants to see her after class because her poem is so amazing and a lyrical masterpiece and should be published. He recruits her for the high school poetry magazine (called REFLECTIONS, dear lord), and he makes a lot of eye contact with his chocolate-bar-brown eyes. Later that day, Eve puts on her MANOLO BLAHNIK boots and ditches Hot Nate to go to a shoe store. It is very important to know that Eve really, REALLY likes shoes. Like so much. She tries on the same LOUBOUTINS she tried on at the mall and then Jay the hot shoe salesman feels her up and they go fuck in the storeroom among the piles of shoes. As it turns out, our girl Eve has been making love (vomit) with the shoe salesman once a week for the past four months and wishes she could run away with him. Oh, Eve. Addie and Hot Nate are at a Reflections meeting and he tells her he's entering her poem in a state competition because she is ""a master of this craft, even at sixteen"" and is so amazing. Addie says she's not amazing at math and Hot Nate asks if his wife is giving Addie a hard time and then says a bunch of shit about how he was dumb at math too and his wife is too logical and not a dreamer like they are... and now Addie is officially being groomed! Then it's Eve's thirtieth birthday and she puts on her LOUIS VUITTON pumps and tries to bone Hot Nate before work, but he's not into it again. Uh oh. Later that night they go out to dinner at a (yep) pasta restaurant and have a terrible time. Nate parks really far away from the entrance to the restaurant which is a dick move because she's still wearing those LOUIS VUITTON pumps with a four-inch heel. Eve thinks she should try to connect more with Hot Nate and let him read his poems to her in a park again like he used to (all I can think about are the Kens playing guitar at the Barbies for four hours on the beach), even though she doesn't even like poetry and would rather do quadratic equations because she likes MATH, goddammit. Hot Nate gets flirted with by the waitress and then spots Addie at the restaurant and talks about Addie's lyrical mind and their mutual love of Edgar Allan Poe a bunch to his wife. Happy B-day, Eve! Addie notices Hot Nate is eating ravioli and ponders his filling selection and wishes she was eating dinner with him so he could share his thoughts about EAP poems with her (again with the Kens on the beach). Addie and Hot Nate run into each other by the pasta restaurant bathroom (sex-ay!) and she worries that someone will see them talking and he'll end up ruined like Santa Tuttle. She tells him about her terrible day being bullied, so he gives her a special homework assignment to write an angry revenge letter to her bully and Addie thinks about what a bitch Eve is for making Hot Nate so unhappy. After the terrible birthday meal, Eve finds a pair of glossy red SAM EDELMAN sling pumps on her porch from Jay. Awww. Sex shoes!Addie's locker gets filled with shaving cream by mean Kenzie, and during the cleanup -- in the first McTwist -- reveals that Hudson helped her kill her father. DUN DUN DUNNNNN! Her dad was a drunk, abusive asshole and they pushed him down the stairs and pretended they were at Hudson's house studying the whole time. After the murder Hudson completely stopped talking to her, but he still helps her clean her locker because he is such a nice guy.Then Hot Nate comes along and helps clean up the last bit of locker shaving cream and offers Addie a ride home from school in his Honda Accord. Addie is digging the ride because the car is cleaner than her mom's and smells like him, and he tells her about the difficulty he experienced being a poetry-writing sixteen-year-old boy and recites the first poem he ever wrote (for his mom, at age six, which Jesus H DOES NOT COUNT AS A POEM), and she wishes they would kiss and thinks ""there's something poetic about the name Nathaniel"" (aaaand I am officially dead because my husband is named Nathaniel and I can't stop laughing even though this entire situation is gross AF). ANYWAY, Eve fucks Jay again. Addie cheats on a math midterm and gets busted. Eve wears her MANOLO BLAHNIKS to school. Hot Nate takes Eve to the bone zone after school so she doesn't rat Addie out to the principal for cheating on the math test. Addie steals Kenzie's keys, lets herself into her house, and breaks a ceramic bird. We are now 47% through this goddamn book.Hot Nate and Addie talk again after a Reflections meeting, and he lets her know that he got her out of trouble with his mean wife. Addie hugs Hot Nate to say thank you, ""But then something firm pokes me in the leg. Like a roll of toilet paper."" Um. I have read more than my fair share of sex business in books and have never in my life heard a boner compared to a roll of toilet paper. I have a lot of questions. Hot Nate apologizes to Addie for the toilet roll in his pants and then immediately launches into complaining about how his wife sucks and how he feels like he's finally connected to someone for the first time in his life. Addie leaves but can't stop thinking about that firm toilet paper pants roll (GIRL, RUN!) and comes back. Hot Nate says he's trying so hard to resist her but he just can't and then they go into the abandoned photography darkroom and make out a bunch. Hot Nate drives Addie home afterwards and tells her she's his soulmate. Then he goes home and tries to bone zone Eve but she turns him down, so now his toilet roll is blue and he is mad.Addie writes a terrible poem about her love for Hot Nate. Then Hot Nate reads her a terrible poem that he wrote. And now I can no longer call him Hot Nate as a joke because he's officially a fucking rapist.Addie and Sexual Predator Nate have a lot of predatory sex in the darkroom. SP Nate continues with the soulmate talk to keep Addie hooked even though ""it doesn't last long, and Nathaniel says that's normal when you like somebody as much as he likes me."" AAAAAAAGH. Addie starts thinking about how much better everything would be if Eve was not around anymore.Then Addie gets her lunch dumped on the ground by Kenzie and Kenzie sees a copy of the poem SP Nate wrote. Eve is mean and won't let Addie eat a sandwich during class, so Addie hates her even more. Eve and SP Nate have a bad dinner party with their friends. Eve spots Addie lurking in the bushes outside of their house and tells SP Nate about it. Eve then tells the principal and Addie gets hauled into the office. SP Nate tells her to ""deny everything"" so she lies and says she wasn't there, but since she also got busted lurking outside of Santa Tuttle's house no one believes her. SP Nate starts ghosting Addie so she goes to see him in his classroom during lunch. They kiss AND EVE SEES THEM and takes a picture. This is the part of the book where Eve talks a bunch about how none of this is Addie's fault and that she is a child and that SP Nate is a fucking creep who took advantage of her vulnerability and that it was his responsibility to keep this from happening because he is an adult. Then goes on to say the age of consent is sixteen, so he's technically NOT a rapist. Keep all of this in mind when we get to the fucking epilogue.Eve then meets up with her fuckboy shoe salesman Jay and tells him everything. They decide she needs to leave Nate and also decide not to tell the principal. Then Eve gets wasted, confronts Nate, and kicks him out. He yells at her a bunch about shoes and leaves. He texts Addie and says he wishes Eve was dead. Addie concurs and eats a bunch of ice cream. Eve also eats a bunch of ice cream and passes out on the couch. She wakes up to a loud crash and worries someone is breaking in to steal her LOUBOUTINS because that is rational and because LOUBOUTINS haven't been mentioned for a few chapters.omfg we're almost at the end. buckle up.The crashing sound was Addie knocking a frying pan off of the stove. Eve and Addie confront each other and Eve says a bunch of reasonable things about SP Nate being a manipulative predator and how his feelings for a teenager are not normal and Addie flips the fuck out and hits Eve in the head with the frying pan. Three times. She calls SP Nate using Eve's phone and SP Nate comes over. Eve wakes up while Addie is getting a sheet to wrap her corpse in and SP Nate strangles her. Addie notices that Eve's body is in a different location and now she has big finger-shaped bruises on her neck, but SP Nate convinces her to help put Eve's body in the trunk and they drive her body to an abandoned pumpkin patch. We learn that SP Nate's biggest fears are death and snakes. They start digging a hole, but then SP Nate lies about getting Eve's purse from the car and abandons Addie and goes home to bed. Addie finishes burying Eve and messages Hudson to come pick her up from the middle of nowhere. Now SP Nate is at home and weird shit keeps happening. He finds shoes in the shower and thinks about The Raven a bunch and eventually calls the police to report Eve missing. He then finds more shoes in strange places - some covered in dirt, some with smashed pumpkin on them, and then there's a bird in his kitchen so he thinks about The Raven some more. FFS. The police visit Addie and question her a little and seem to think she killed Eve because SP Nate shows them her rage letter about Kenzie. Then Kenzie shows up at Addie's house and apologizes for being such a huge bitch and tells Addie SHE was in a relationship with SP Nate when she was FOURTEEN and knows Addie is also being abused because SP Nate gave them both the same shitty poem (which she saw in the lunchroom) and they had to break up when Addie had her Santa Tuttle scandal so that's why she hates Addie so much. The girls then go to the police station and tell them everything - and the police actually believe them, which feels like a fucking miracle.SP Nate is home and finds a pumpkin with a bird inside in his kitchen and freaks out because THE RAVEN. The police are on their way so he goes to the pumpkin patch to check Eve’s grave and make sure she's really dead. Uh-oh... The grave is empty! Eve is alive! Turns out she unburied herself and called Jay to come get her. Jay takes her to the sexy shoe store and gives her some sensible winter non-fuck boots and hides her in his tool shed for a few days. They start pranking SP Nate with the shoes and pumpkins and birds and whatnot and when he goes to the grave they are waiting and hit him with a rock and chuck him in the hole and bury him alive. While digging, Eve remembers the poem SP Nate wrote her when she was fifteen and he was her teacher - and (McTwist!) it’s the same poem he gave Addie and Kenzie so I guess we’re all happy SP Nate is going to be dead in the pumpkin patch because he's a Serial SP with an unstoppable toilet roll. Now we’re (FINALLY) in the epilogue. The police stop investigating because Eve isn’t actually dead and they assume SP Nate just left town without a trace. Eve quits her job and also moves away. Hudson and Addie are friends again and Kenzie has stopped bullying Addie and no one is being sexually abused anymore, so I guess everyone is fine?And now for the final McTwist: IT TURNS OUT HUDSON JANKOWSKI IS THE JAY EVE WAS FUCKING IN THE SHOE STORE so she’s also a sexual predator despite her earlier CORRECT yelling at SP Nate about it being wrong to - you know - have sex with minors. For fuck’s sake. Also - from a strictly logistical standpoint… how did Hudson/Jay manage to drive to the middle of nowhere and back twice in one night to pick up both Addie and Eve? And why is he hanging out with Addie even though she tried to kill Eve? And he already knows she killed her dad? And how did he and Eve catch all of the birds? And get one to stay in a pumpkin? The end.EDITED 2/22/24 TO ADD/CLARIFY : Jay was not married. The baby was his little brother. The ""her""/woman on the phone was Jay/Hudson's mom. And according to FMcF herself... (thanks to a commenter asking FMcF directly) -- EVE KNEW JAY/HUDSON WAS A STUDENT AT HER SCHOOL. Aaaaaaaaaagh barf blech ewwww fuuuuuuck.",1.0
266,Never Lie,,4.11,"['September', '19,', '2022']","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖 I read this as part of a group buddy read on Instagram which is why I didn't yeet it into outer space.  One sentence review:  L M F A O you're joking  SYNOPSIS Newlyweds Tricia and Ethan are snowed in during their viewing at the creepy, dusty, secluded mcmansion once owned by Dr. Adrienne Hale, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace four years ago. When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor's disappearance.  MY OPINION BUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE. Where to start, where to start? Ok let's do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here's an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:  But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere. I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere. Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here's a sample: I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him? The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming. Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won't reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:  I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.  Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they're gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.  SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM At first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan's BMW (it's not a car, it's a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she's okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman's RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty. Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she's shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn't one.Tricia's behaviour doesn't even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog's bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would've made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together. Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I'm going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I've read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest. Adding her to my avoid list lol. PROS AND CONS Pros: funny rants with the buddy readers, she did have some good red herrings in there tbh Cons: ... did I stutter? 😂___Check out my YouTube",1.0

268,The Housemaid's Secret,,4.26,"['February', '15,', '2023']","In a Nutshell: The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order. Story Synopsis: Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening? The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie. This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book. Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side, ⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book. ⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing. All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it. 3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.The book is also available to Kindle Unlimited subscribers. ———————————————Connect with me through:

269,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,,4.33,"['May', '2,', '2019']","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
270,The Inmate,,4.08,"['June', '13,', '2022']","★ 1 starThe plot? Weak.The protagonist? Dumb.The writing? Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad. It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time. This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone. Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it. All the maybe he isn’t—, maybe I should be—, maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself. I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him. Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. — Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?! A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate? Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable. Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actually thrilling to disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1.0
271,None of This Is True,Lisa Jewell returns with a scintillating new psychological thriller about a woman who finds herself the subject of her own popular true crime podcast.,4.14,"['July', '20,', '2023']","I’m speechless after reading this bone chilling, dark, twisty, mind bending thriller which is one of the best works of Lisa Jewel.After reading a few pages, you find yourself drawn into riveting psychological thriller with unreliable characters, shocking revelations in podcast meets documentary blending in narration of incidents by hours and dates. It starts slow but the sinister feeling tingles beneath your neck, warning you bad things are about to come and sooner all hell breaks loose. So many red flags appear in your vision as you keep flipping the pages. At the second half, things get escalated! You barely hold your screams as more tragic events follow each other. It’s like listening to a concerto slowly raises its tempo and as you reach the ending, you hear the crescendo: that’s moment the earth shattering revelation squeezes your heart, you barely breathe!  I have so many words for the ending that are not enough to express my feelings. It’s heartbreaking, shocking, eerie, unsettling, disturbing! The storyline revolves around two women who share the same birthday, were born in the same city, hospital, chose the same place to celebrate their 45th birthday. One of them is Alix Summers; famous podcaster promoting aspiring women who take their second changes for life to achieve bigger things. The other woman is Josie Fair, married with her husband two times older than her, mother of 2 daughters in twenties, a teen mother, who is unsatisfied with her life and her unaccomplished dreams.   On the other hand, Alix lives in her dream house, happily married, with two young children. Her husband’s late benders start to damage their marriage. She wants a distraction not to confront for her problems.   Josie is adamant to involve in Alix’s life, creating coincidences to bump into her around her children’s schoolyard. When Josie starts to tell her about her traumatic life, Alix thinks she already found the distraction she needed. Using Josie’s story who wants to make imminent changes in her life may attract her audiences’ attention.   But Josie seems like more than telling her story, lurking around Alix’s house, trying to be part of her life, criticizing her marriage.The things Josie confesses during podcast recording scare the living daylights of Alix. Is Josie survivor of years long abuse, neglect, traumatic experiences? Could Alix help her birth twin for setting her free from her torturous life? Or did she invite trouble into her own house by accepting to make this podcast?   When Josie knocks her door in the middle of the night, Alix realizes things can get more out of control and nothing as it seems. Overall, it’s one of the stories that stay with you for years, still giving you goosebumps at each time you remember the characters and main events. It took my breath away! I think I’m not going to get peaceful sleep for a long time. The birthday twins’ story may haunt me forever!  Dear Lisa Jewel perfectly achieved to rock my world again! Giving my highly deserved five stars to this mind numbing, complex, highly sinister, perfectly developed and executed novel! Special thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this brilliant novels of digital copy in exchange my honest thoughts.If you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
272,The Coworker,,3.81,"['August', '23,', '2023']","Mcfadden is finally back after some let-downs. This was a fast-paced thriller for sure. I liked the characters, which is great after being so dissatisfied with the characters in never lie and ward d. Even if the main character had her flaws, I felt they were explained better and there was some character development (at least a bit). I must admit I saw the twist coming, but was still curious about how it all would play out, so it was a breeze reading. In the afterword McFadden writes that she’s worked on this book for over 20 (!) years and that shows as I couldn’t find no obvious plot holes, and it was told convincingly. Maybe there was a bit too much spoon-feeding when it came to Dawn who obviously was on the spectrum, but from what I read it wasn’t too stereotypical, and I wasn’t annoyed by the way McFadden described her personality. There was actually a lovely moment in the end and I found myself tearing up. How often does that happen in your standard psychological thriller? Thanks to netgalley and the publisher for the arc",4.0
273,The Locked Door,,4.09,"['June', '1,', '2021']","I’m just not fully understanding the plethora of brilliant ratings for this very mediocre novel. The entire story is reminiscent of In My Father's Basement, but without the intense character development and attention to detail that made Payne’s tale a solid stroke of genius. Instead, the brusque, straightforward style employed by author Freida McFadden is almost too simplistic. The attempt here to portray Nora as a potential heir to her father’s murderous throne comes across as elementary in technique and is never completely convincing, while the final epilogue seals the book’s fate as a valiant effort, minus the “valiant”.",3.0
274,The Perfect Marriage,Would you defend your husband if he was accused of killing his mistress?,3.97,"['July', '3,', '2020']","When I'm feeling a reading slump coming on, I usually pick up a nice fast-paced thriller to get me back into things. According to the reviews, The Perfect Marriage should have been that. All I can say is I guess it's true that it did make me want to read literally anything else.I don't get the hype. The writing isn't great, needs at least another round of editing, and there are plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. Everything is obvious, yet also verging on ridiculous, and people (mostly Adam) act absolutely moronic for no reason whatsoever.Everyone is awful, and not in an interesting way. Adam is the doucheiest misogynistic alpha male douchebag, not to mention a total dumbass, who seemed to do everything within his power to make himself look guilty. Sarah has to whisper ""bitch"" to herself whenever another woman in the room doesn't kiss her arse. The police investigation is laughable, so is the fact that they would charge Adam and send this to trial without accounting for several anomalies that showed up in the ""evidence"" (like someone else's DNA). Sarah, a lawyer, gets more facts on this case than the police have by simply having a conversation with the victim's colleague, which I guess the police neglected to do. And that attempt to explain away the shoddy investigation with the ""oh, it was the sheriff's DNA"" left me far more annoyed than satisfied. Way too convenient and it didn't make any sense.Also, was Kelly in an abusive relationship? Because I'm pretty sure that wasn't cleared up(?) I don't like when a character knows something is or isn't true because they see it in someone's eyes, or some other such nonsense, but then it turned out that maybe he was lying? Who even knows?So many other things I could whine about. The dialogue and the characters' actions all seemed so juvenile; not a single member of law enforcement or attorney behaved with a hint of professionalism-- all of them acted seedy, violent or just plain stupid. I got the sense that the author had no idea about criminal investigations or court proceedings. It is irritating when I put things together way before the characters do and have to watch them scratch their heads and think ""where have I seen this guy before?"" It is also irritating when characters act one way for the entire book then turn to the audience and mwahaha at the end.So much doesn't make sense. The outcome of this book is only reached by having everyone be stupid and do silly things for no reason.",1.0
275,One by One,,4.00,"['July', '13,', '2020']","I really need to learn not to rely strictly on reviews for recommendations, as it seems more and more often I find myself at odds with the majority. This supposed “thriller” demonstrates my point beautifully. While most of those who reviewed the book found it to be “captivating”, I found it to be tedious and redundant, populated with characters whom I disliked from the very beginning. The story was short on detail, save the three or four specifics that were repeated ad nauseam—Claire is unhappy, Claire loves her children, Michelle is a cold fish, Warner is handsome. Over. And over. And over. Three stars for effort and the fact that it was mercifully short.",3.0
276,Listen for the Lie,What if you thought you murdered your best friend? And if everyone else thought so too? And what if the truth doesn't matter?,4.19,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Oh yes I do enjoy a humorous thriller, thank you very much!When it comes to this genre, it often feels like it's a race to see who's got the darkest, grittiest, most nail-biting, anxiety-inducing story. And that's all good and fine. But I don't always want dark, darker, darkest. Sometimes, I just want a bit of fun, and Listen for the Lie is exactly that.From the very first page, this was unputdownable. The format of alternating between Lucy and the podcast and having each chapter be nice and short kept me turning the pages, wanting to read just one more page. The podcast transcripts were surprisingly engaging, with every character dishing on every other character and stirring up small-town drama.I was worried this would turn out to be another one of those dreaded unreliable narrator situations, where the main female character drinks to excess and indulges in woe-is-me pity parties. But thankfully it wasn't. Instead, Lucy's voice is so fresh and wickedly honest. She's often sarcastic and funny, and it sets the tone for an extremely entertaining read.As for the actual mystery itself, my feelings are a bit mixed. On the one hand, this story certainly doesn't scrimp on the twists and turns just because it's humorous. We are directed one way, then another. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always great fun. I suspect there are enough surprises here to satisfy even the most seasoned of thriller junkies. But on the other hand, calling this a ""world-class whodunit"" (I'm looking at you, Stephen King) is taking it a step too far. As is typical of modern thrillers, there aren't really clues. You find out each twist as the book reveals it to you, often via the podcast interviews. Apparently—and I must try this in real life—you just need to badger people with enough questions and they'll tell you all their secrets. And eventually, Lucy remembers the whole thing and that's the denouement. It did feel a bit anticlimactic after all that buildup.Small quibble aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's always a great delight to find a book that keeps you up past your bedtime and even though you know you're going to pay for it the next day, you just don't care.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0
277,The Guest List,,3.82,"['February', '20,', '2020']","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

278,"Good Girl, Bad Blood",,4.31,"['April', '30,', '2020']","FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!  This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)  I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.  When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him. Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time. This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!  Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
279,The Silent Patient,The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.,4.18,"['January', '1,', '2018']","This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0
280,Gone Girl,,4.13,"['December', '6,', '2012']","3 1/2 stars.This is going to be a hard review to write because I feel so conflicted about my final rating and just how much I actually liked this book. For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively ""good"", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",3.0
281,The Girl on the Train,,3.96,"['January', '13,', '2015']","I once read a book by a former alcoholic where she described giving oral sex to two different men, men she'd just met in a restaurant on a busy London high street. I read it and I thought, I'm not that bad. This is where the bar is set.oh, yeah - this one is going to be a must-read for those people looking to find their next Gone Girl experience. it's an incredibly fast-paced and engrossing psychological thriller, and i was on board as soon as i read the editor's bit of ARC-copy, even though i know that writing those things is part of the job and not at all unbiased. but it's hard not to be swayed when you read:Within days of my introducing the manuscript in March, people from every department were regularly pulling me aside to testify to how much they loved the read, how they couldn't put it down. At a recent meeting, a colleague who was twelve pages from the end was secretly reading them under the table because she could not stop. Another had the manuscript propped up next to her phone so she could read between calls, and last week in the elevator, people around me suddenly started competing over who'd read it fastest, and who was more surprised by the ending. You know you have something special when it becomes watercooler talk for months on end.it would take a very stubbornly cynical person to see that as anything other than genuine enthusiasm. and the book definitely delivers. it is an absolute page-turner with a number of unreliable narrators ranging from the self-deluded to the spotty memory of the blackout drunk. i am too busy reading on my daily commute to notice my fellow passengers unless they are smelly/behaving in an unstable manner (frequently), or exceptionally attractive (MUCH less frequently), but apparently this is a thing that commuters do - notice their fellow travelers, making up stories about their lives, speculating about what they do when they're not in the in-between moments of their day. and rachel does it more than most. rachel is blisteringly lonely, drowning the sorrows of her failed marriage with grim determination and canned gin and tonics and endless bottles of wine. she has lost her job because of her perpetual drunkenness, but rather than tell her flatmate, she keeps taking the train into london every day, pretending to go to work, but actually just getting drunk in various places, and happily fantasizing about the young couple she watches every day from her train window; a couple who live a few doors down from her old house, where her ex-husband tom still resides with his new wife and baby girl. still reeling from tom's infidelity to her, she nonetheless would love to be back with him, and in this golden couple she observes and imagines, calling them ""jess and jason,"" she sees the life she could have had with tom. one day, while commuting/gazing voyeuristically, she witnesses ""jess"" on her front lawn with another man, in what appears to be a romantic clinch. she is outraged at this display, as personally offended as if the infidelity were being committed against herself. shortly after this episode, she learns that ""jess,"" actually named megan, has disappeared, and feeling connected to this couple she has never actually met, she insinuates herself into the investigation, meeting with both the police and megan's husband, actual name scott. the story is told from three perspectives: rachel's, megan's, and tom's new wife anna, and covers all the traditional viewpoints of the typical domestic drama: the jilted lover, the other woman, the cheating wife. all three of these women are simultaneously sympathetic and repellent, which is tricky to pull off. and as for the mystery of megan's disappearance itself, well that path splits and splits again in a wonderful head-spinning journey where not a single character avoids suspicion (except MAYBE tom and anna's infant daughter); i think there are seven characters in total who appear to be the culprit at one point or another, and each seems as plausible as the next. it is a fantastic ride, and hawkins does a great job with both the mystery elements and the character development, with great attention to detail, and fully established backstories and motivations. even when you cringe at some of the choices, they completely make sense for the character. it is a lot of fun, and terribly addictive. much better than a meeting, i kid you not.come to my blog!",4.0
282,The Da Vinci Code,,3.92,"['March', '18,', '2003']","Four stars for pure entertainment value.However, Dave Barry's review gets five stars:`The Da Vinci Code,' crackedby Dave BarryI have written a blockbuster novel. My inspiration was The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown, which has sold 253 trillion copies in hardcover because it's such a compelling page-turner. NOBODY can put this book down:MOTHER ON BEACH: Help! My child is being attacked by a shark!LIFEGUARD (looking up from The DaVinci Code: Not now! I just got to page 243, where it turns out that one of the men depicted in ''The Last Supper'' is actually a woman!MOTHER: I know! Isn't that incredible? And it turns out that she's . . .SHARK (spitting out the child): Don't give it away! I'm only on page 187!The key to The DaVinci Code is that it's filled with startling plot twists, and almost every chapter ends with a ''cliffhanger,'' so you have to keep reading to see what will happen. Using this formula, I wrote the following blockbuster novel, titled The Constitution Conundrum. It's fairly short now, but when I get a huge publishing contract, I'll flesh it out to 100,000 words by adding sentences.CHAPTER ONE: Handsome yet unmarried historian Hugh Heckman stood in the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., squinting through the bulletproof glass at the U.S. Constitution. Suddenly, he made an amazing discovery.''My God!'' he said, out loud. ``This is incredible! Soon I will say what it is.''CHAPTER TWO: ''What is it?'' said a woman Heckman had never seen before who happened to be standing next to him. She was extremely beautiful, but wore glasses as a sign of intelligence.''My name is Desiree Legume,'' she said.Heckman felt he could trust her.''Look at this!'' he said, pointing to the Constitution.''My God, that's incredible!'' said Desiree. ``It's going to be very surprising when we finally reveal what we're talking about!''CHAPTER THREE: ''Yes,'' said Hugh, ``incredible as it seems, there are extra words written in the margin of the U.S. Constitution, and nobody ever noticed them until now! They appear to be in some kind of code.''''Let me look,'' said Desiree. ``In addition to being gorgeous, I am a trained codebreaker. Oh my God!''''What is it?'' asked Hugh in an excited yet concerned tone of voice. ''The message,'' said Desiree, ``is . . . ''But just then, the chapter ended.CHAPTER FOUR: ''It's a fiendishly clever code,'' explained Desiree. 'As you can see, the words say: `White House White House Bo Bite House, Banana Fana Fo Fite House, Fe Fi Mo Mite House, White House.' ''''Yes,'' said Hugh, frowning in bafflement. ``But what can it possibly mean?''''If I am correct,'' said Desiree, ``it is referring to . . . the White House!''''My God!'' said Hugh. ``That's where the president lives! Do you think . . . ''''Do I think what?'' said Desiree.''I don't know,'' said Hugh. ``But we're about to find out.''CHAPTER FIVE: Hugh and Desiree crouched in some bushes next to the Oval Office.''We'd better hurry up and solve this mystery,'' remarked Desiree anxiously. ''It's only a matter of time before somebody notices that the Constitution is missing.'' She had slipped it into her purse at the National Archives while the guard wasn't looking.''The answer must be here somewhere,'' said Hugh, studying the ancient document, which was brown from age and the fact that he had spilled Diet Peach Snapple on it.''Wait a minute!'' he said. ``I've got it!''''What?'' said Desiree, her breasts heaving into view.''The answer!'' said Hugh. ``It's . . .But just then, shots rang out.CHAPTER SIX: ''That was close!'' remarked Desiree. ``Fortunately, those shots had nothing to do with the plot of this book.''''Yes,'' said Hugh. ``Anyway, as I was saying, the answer is to hold the Constitution up so that it is aligned with the White House and the Washington Monument. . . . There, do you see what I mean?''''My God!'' said Desiree, seeing what he meant. ``It's . . . ''''Hold it right there,'' said the president of the United States.CHAPTER SEVEN: '' . . . and so you see,'' concluded the president, ``you two uncovered a shocking and fascinating secret that, if it should ever get out, could change the course of history.''''Mr. President,'' said Desiree, ``thank you for that riveting and satisfying explanation, which will be fleshed out into much greater detail once there is a publishing contract.''''Also,'' noted Hugh, ``we may use some beverage other than Snapple, depending on what kind of product-placement deals can be worked out.''''Good,'' said the president. ``Now can I have the Constitution back?''They all enjoyed a hearty laugh, for they knew that the movie rights were also available...",3.0
283,Verity,,4.32,"['December', '7,', '2018']","2.5 stars?This was straight-up hilarious. The funniest creepy book ever written. Did I hear that people cried while reading this? I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑 So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman, this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is. Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don't even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue. She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn't concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in. Oh but she's so evil😢, oh but she's so callous🙄, she's just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time. Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes: 💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean like literally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I'd be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me. 

I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.

How I imagined Verity every time she'd unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.

my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast. My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy. Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.

Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I was half fully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav. I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn't creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie. 

He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.

And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I've ever read. EVER. In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you'd expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We're not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn't care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power. EDIT 08.2022: 8 months later and I've decided we're gonna talk about the ending. Here's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I'm gonna choose the letter. As we've already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn't any better. Personally being impressed with the author's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist... WOULD BE if this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn't, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one. all in all: I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that's about it.EDIT 10.2022: I've read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍",2.0

There were too many red herrings, and the damn Nazi red herring didn't have the usual payoff.7. Too/Two many plots. 8. Too hard on Leviticus. I will answer these in a moment, but first I must declare that I am an unrepentant fan of this book. This is one of the rare times when I long for goodreads to have half grades, because I would love to give this 4.5. I can't give it a full 5, though, because I sense Mr. Larsson's series is going to grow in his last two books. And now...back to the top eight complaints:1. Perhaps, but how can a book whose original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women"" avoid misogyny? It can't. But at least the misogyny present is a comment on misogyny. Larsson isn't being misogynist. He's attacking misogyny. Moreover, our hero, Mikael Blomkvist, is not one of the men who hate women. He is a pretty good guy, actually; in fact, he's one of the rare guys I would actually categorize as a ""good guy"" in most modern literature. Sure...he's a bad Dad. Sure...he has a failed marriage and many sexual relationships. Sure...he makes some decisions that challenge his ethics. But he remains a ""good guy."" He tries to do well in an ugly world. He never succumbs to cynicism. And he genuinely cares about all the people in his life. Male and female. And it's not like Berger and Salander are weak women -- far from it. There may be misogyny in Men Who Hate Women, but it is wholly the characters' misogyny -- those who have it -- and not the author's.2. With apologies to my friend who's first name starts with T: Cliché, smiché! Yes there's some cliché -- maybe plenty of cliché -- but who cares?! Seriously? We're not talking about Proust here. We're talking about a mystery novel, a serial killer who-dunnit. Complaining about cliché in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like complaining about ""pinko sympathies"" in The Communist Manifesto.There's communism in Marx? Really? You think!?3 & 7. Yep. There's a couple of distinct plots here, but there's a level of verisimilitude to that. Have even our banal lives ever had anything important happen without something else important occurring at the same time? Not mine, and to have multiple incidents happening simultaneously makes sense to me. The search for Harriet Vanger wasn't hampered at all by the Wennerström drama, and vice versa. And to be honest, I loved having a pair of mysteries solved in the same novel. 4. Too disturbing compared to what? It's nowhere near as disturbing as American Psycho, and it's about average as far as the serial killer genre goes. Plus, I think there is a power in the graphic moments of this novel, particularly Lisbeth's vengeance on her guardian. I am not on her side when it comes to this vengeance, but I understand it, and the drive to take vengeance in such a way -- such a human way -- fascinates me. Who'd have thought, besides maybe my friend Manny, that the Swedes have it in them?5. Perhaps this is true, but at this point I have only read one of the trilogy, and the only person who suggested that Lisbeth was autistic was Mikael, and while he thought she was suffering from Asberger's his guess was only in passing. I can cut the book some slack here. (suspend my disbelief, suspend my disbelief).6. I was stoked that, for once, the Nazis were a red herring rather than the ultimate, degenerated evil. We all expect the Nazis to be the worst of the worst, so it is refreshing to see them as a deflection instead. 8. Can anyone really be too hard on Leviticus? Ummmmm...nope.Now, I admit that I might love this novel simply because it is set in Sweden. After all, I do love ABBA, Fredrik Ljungberg, IKEA (my apologies), glögg, Stellan Skarsgård, Max von Sydow, Ingmar Bergman, and Mats Sundin. I looked into emigrating to Sweden but had no excuse, being a resident of Canada with no skills the Swedes were looking for, and I am a fan of Norse Mythology, but I do love Sweden, and I was jazzed by the setting of Larsson's book. All that aside, however, I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a compelling, entertaining and unabashedly thrilling read.If you can overlook the eight complaints, or consider them in a different light, you'll like this book too. I promise.",4.0

286,Sharp Objects,,4.02,"['September', '26,', '2006']","“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.”
There is something deeply unhealthy about this book. It's in the characters, in the story, in the relationships, in the sex, and just in the general mood of the novel. Reading this made me feel a little unwell, both physically and mentally, but I am glad I did. If you know me, you'll know I love complex characters with issues that feel raw and real, rather than melodramatic. The people in this novel are majorly fucked up, no one is without a dark past and everyone, it seems, has a horror story.The protagonist - Camille Preaker - was just thirteen when her sister died and fuelled by grief (amongst other things) Camille spent her teen years carving words into her flesh, covering almost every inch of her body with the marks of her pain. Ten years later, Camille Preaker is now a journalist who returns to the small town of her youth to report on the murders of two young girls - girls who had had all of their teeth removed.Camille is soon caught up in the town once again, she tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the troublesome half sister she hardly knows. It seems that once again small towns hold the biggest secrets and Camille finds herself getting dragged deeper and deeper into the investigation, her fragile state of mind constantly threatening to tip her over the edge.This is one mean and nasty book. I knew I was getting a dark, psychological thriller, but I expected something on par with In The Woods by Tana French. Um, not exactly. Flynn never shies away from the horrific details. You're not going to find anything pleasant in this story; sex, for example, is always something complex - it's an escape or a bargain or a catharsis. Everything else is similar.Flynn does a fantastic job of challenging the notion that women are weak, innocent, damsels in distress. In a world where women are victims - both in their media representation and in statistics - this is a very interesting look at other kinds of women. It's programmed into us to believe that women are safer, kinder, built with an instinct that makes it difficult for them to be cruel and cause pain without reason. Maybe we were always wrong.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",4.0
287,The Guest List,,3.82,"['February', '20,', '2020']","Hell yeah! My choice as best thriller won big again! 🥳💜🎈This book is a rule breaker for me because I hate two things throughout my readings: 1)	Too many POVS: I got confused easily and I don’t like to go back to remember which character was the post man rang twice or which character had some irrelevant back story, blablas, unnecessary yadayadas2)	Slow burning story telling: I’m impatient person, I like to go straight and cut to the chase. So I don’t like stalling around facts, I just like to dive in! BUT… this book is an exception. I loved its slow building tension, I loved the notorious, immature, childish boys club (I’m talking about groom’s friends who are acting like wedding crashers and stayed in their teenage years), I loved variety of interesting, rich, attention taker characterization. And wonderful part is till the end of the book we are left in the dark and we have no idea who is death or the identity of perpetrator.  You have to focus so carefully when you read the chapters because any small detail turns out a big clue for you to solve the puzzle and not to get shocked when you face the surprising, twisty revelations and the connections between the characters. Yes, I have to stop that but I have to admit, at the end of the book my mouth was wide open, my eyes popped out and I stayed like this position for one hour. The neighborhood kids thought their dreams finally came true and I turned into a sculpture. Even the crows thought I was not a human and they left some gifts to my head( Yes, I washed ten times)But when I got rid of my first shock and started to move, they screamed and cried in pain. Yes, the witch was back!  Let’s talk about the blurb a little bit: Jules, successful, glamorous and too ambitious magazine publisher, suffering from her anger management issues, selfish, focusing on perfection, giving orders, controlling the people, the worst bridezilla marries with charming, rising star of television, cocky, flirting Will at an island off the coast of Ireland, in the middle of nowhere, limited phone reception, giving you nightmarish vibes, with dark woods, caves, making you feel like somebody sneaking behind you. (Perfect place to low budget independent horror movie but not so preferable wedding place. Bridezilla doesn’t care, she knows the best!) Our other characters: Helen (plus 1) married with bride’s oldest and best male friend Charlie, having doubts about their so intense and secluded relationship, mother, graphic designer at long maternity leave, suffering from traumatic family drama, having her own secrets, befriending bridesmaid Olivia. Yes Olivia is 19 years old bridesmaid, half-sister of bridezilla, suffering from a big secret makes her lose weight, cutting herself. The secret is gnawing her. She needs to talk someone before she gets hurt herself. Could Helen be her confidante?  Best man Johnno, seems confused what he’s doing about his life, sharing a really big secret with Will from their high school times, giving him nightmares and making him fell like chasing by the past time ghosts. And he learns something crucial to change his life forever and gives him a motive to do something dangerous… ' Let’s not forget Aoife, wedding planner, working her ass off to organize the entire ceremony, achieving a complex and challenging job but she observes everyone, looking agitated, seems like waiting for the shoe drop. Why is she so frustrated? What is she worried about? The lies, secrets, resentments and big revelations start to fall into her laps like bombs over and over again. And during the ceremony lights go out, screams, pitch black, lights come out, somebody is death….na na na… Welcome to the bridezilla zone! Do you want to know who killed who? Guess what, I already told you so much, you gotta read the rest of it. I hate to admit, I am not fan of Hunting Party. That book disappointed me a lot. But this one is surprisingly good, I couldn’t’ decide if I gave 4 or 5 stars. I decided 4 slow burn, intriguing, smart, entertaining, riveting stars!

288,The Woman in the Window,,3.95,"['January', '2,', '2018']","Who knows what goes on in a family?
Okay, I really don't want to misrepresent this book: The Woman in the Window is a pulpy, fast-paced popcorn thriller. It's not mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it is pageturning goodness. And it was exactly what I needed to get lost in right now.The premise is a little bit of The Girl on the Train and a little bit of The Woman in Cabin 10 (what is it with these girl/woman/wife titles?!), with an unreliable narrator, faulty memories, alcoholism, and the author playing around with our perception of what is true and what is imagined. My need to know what would happen kept me turning pages late into the night until I was physically incapable of keeping my eyes open a moment longer.The Woman in the Window treats a rather obvious plot element as a spoiler for most of the book, so I'll play coy too. It's about a woman called Anna who lives alone ever since separating from her husband and daughter. We're not told the circumstances of the separation, but we do know that Anna has a drinking problem and severe agoraphobia that prevents her from leaving the house.Housebound and drunk, Anna spends her days spying on her neighbours, until one day she witnesses something shocking in the window of the Russell's home. Everything begins to unravel when Anna attempts to report what she saw, and soon everything is being questioned: Did Anna hallucinate? Is it a combination of alcohol and pills? Can she even trust herself?The chapters are short and hard-hitting, making the fast-moving plot zip by even faster (""This is the LAST chapter. Oh wait, the next is only two pages? Okay, this is the last chapter""). I think the author does a great job of capturing both the fuzzy-headed confusion brought on by Anna's alcoholism and the suffocating claustrophobia of staying inside for almost a year. She makes for a pretty great unreliable narrator, and it is easy to feel her frustration when she can't even be sure herself if what she says is completely true.I also really liked how the author included Anna's passion for classic thriller movies. These offer interesting parallels with her reality and make you question whether something really did happen, or if Anna just saw it in a movie. Plus there's something a bit creepy about all these black and white flicks playing out in the background.The Woman in the Window is the kind of cozy psychological thriller that is easy to gobble up in a sitting or two. I didn't even mind that some things were obvious because the getting there was so damn fun and suspenseful. I'll be on the lookout for more from Finn.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",4.0

290,The Housemaid,,4.33,"['April', '26,', '2022']","Check out my 10 thriller recs to read instead of Freida McFadden on YouTube💖Thank you Bookouture and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.  Writing: idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbh After letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.  THE PLOT Millie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!! MY OPINION Honestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I read The Trapped Wife by Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout???? - Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit. - I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know. - The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's like The Wife Between Us mixed with... idk, Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF. - I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've read The Locked Door by this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door. I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read after My Dark Vanessa rips your heart out and stomps all over it.  PROS AND CONS Pros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2.0
291,A Good Girl's Guide to Murder,,4.33,"['May', '2,', '2019']","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
292,Dark Places,,3.95,"['April', '25,', '2009']","“I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.”
I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity. Okay, sorry, I make it sound so negative when actually this book is pretty fantastic if you can stomach the horrors within. I ate this up in a couple of days, finding every opportunity to read that I could... Flynn certainly has a talent for dragging you into her stories and having them take you over until you find out just what the hell is going on.As much as I enjoyed its dark predecessor - Sharp Objects - I think Dark Places was, for me, a more complex and well-developed mystery. I had many theories as to what was going on and all of them were wrong. You know, I honestly think that writing a mystery story must be the most difficult of all, because the reader is your enemy. Most readers of mystery stories will analyse the information they're given, pull it apart, and try desperately to solve the mystery before the characters do - and yet, if they are successful, they feel disappointed. For an author to manage to pull out something both surprising and convincingly real at the end of all this, they have to have a talent for it.Dark Places alternates between the present day and 1985 when Ben Day allegedly massacred three members of his family, his sister - Libby - being the only one to escape and testify as a witness, sending Ben to a life in prison. Now, after years of living on the donations made by concerned members of the public, Libby Day has finally run out of money and is forced to earn some cash by making an appearance at a group meeting where the members believe Ben is innocent. At first, Libby is willing to write them off as crazy fanatics with a grisly obsession... but as more information is presented to her, she starts to question what really happened all those years ago.The story is told from three main points of view and, to say I'm not a fan of multiple perspectives, I thought it was done excellently. Patty Day is an exhausted mother-of-four who starts to fear her son is becoming involved in satanic rituals; torn between wanting to protect him and being a little afraid of what his behaviour means, we begin to question through her eyes whether the heavy metal-loving loner could really have it in him to become a murderer. Then we have Ben Day's point of view. Being inside his mind is a little frightening - we see how his thoughts become increasingly dark, how just wanting to have something normal can lead to the most abnormal behaviour... but does that mean he would really murder his family?And, of course, there is Libby Day. Libby Day is the reason I think I enjoy Flynn's novels so much. She is so imperfect, complex, selfish, violent... but somehow you manage to stay on her side. I have no idea how the author manages this, but I've always loved a protagonist with issues, the kind of issues that make them lash out in ways that would make you hate them if you weren't inside their head, understanding them. She does some horrible things and, though you don't necessarily forgive her for them, you are able to see why.If you're okay reading about filth, gore, and underage sex, then you should dive into this mystery straight away and immerse yourself in the disturbing but awesome mental workings of Gillian Flynn.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store",5.0
293,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest,,4.24,"['May', '1,', '2007']","These books really shouldn't work. Stieg Larsson is a very weird writer. He likes to tell us absolutely everything someone is doing. If Stieg wrote the story of my morning, it would go like this:""Joel woke up around 7:45 a.m. and looked at the clock. He decided he didn't need to get up yet and hit the snooze button. When the alarm sounded again, he dragged himself out of bed and used the toilet. He brushed his teeth and then dressed in a blue striped shirt, black tie and flat front dress slacks he'd purchased on sale at Kohl's. He made himself a cup of coffee, fired up his 13-inch Macbook laptop and checked his email. He had 14 messages. 11 of them were advertisements from various mailing lists or spam emails encouraging him to enlarge his penis. One message was from his mother and two more were shipping notices for books he'd purchased from Amazon.com. He read the note from his mother but decided to reply later. He then deleted all the messages but the two from Amazon and closed his laptop. He sat on the couch and stared into space, drinking his coffee and thinking.""Most writers would probably start the scene several paragraphs later, when I finally get to work (that's where the real excitement happens! I check even MORE email!). (Plus it turns out I'm not even a main character.) But for some reason, this style is, I don't know, endearing instead of annoying. I love the way he tells us every time Mikael has a cigarette or what he likes on his sandwiches. And hey, at least I know what brand of cell phone everyone is using.It's kind of weird how the series wound up being not at all what I was expecting. Book one was closest, a serial killer story that was nevertheless a weird mash-up of political potboiler and are-the-lambs-screaming-Clarice murder fun. But then book two was mostly about the internal politics of the Swedish police and media industries. And the big climax of the trilogy comes down to an incredibly extended legal thriller, Grisham-style. I assume. I've never read a John Grisham book.But really, everyone knows why the books work, and it's because of the characters. Stieg approached the whole trilogy as a sort of manifesto about the injustices heaped upon women in Swedish society, and illustrates them via a host of compelling, level-headed, fairly well-rounded women who are fun to read about even when they spend every other page having sex with the Stieg stand-in. Everyone loves Lisbeth, of course, and this installment does a good job of fleshing out her back story and explaining how exactly one winds up a tattooed, antisocial computer-hacking genius with an insatiable hunger for revenge and Billy's pan pizza.This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. I don't read legal thrillers but I love courtroom scenes in movies, especially when judges say stuff like ""I'm going to allow it, but you'd better be going somewhere with this."" No one says that here, but only because apparently you can do whatever the fuck you want in a Swedish courtroom without bothering to talk to the judge at all. On the bright side, a flustered prosecutor does break out another old chestnut --""This is highly irregular!"" -- that almost makes up for it.So, yeah, I'm a little sad that Lisbeth has stalked off to that big Ikea-furnished apartment in the sky to join her creator. And I wish Stieg didn't eat quite so many of the fatty sandwiches and Billy's pan pizzas he loved detailing so much (hey, write what you know). If book 4 never emerges from that mythical laptop, though, this is a pretty good place to end things.",4.0
294,One Way Back: A Memoir,,4.33,"['March', '19,', '2024']","Dr. Ford's story of how she tried to get her story out as well as the abuse she suffered before, during, and after her testimony is an indictment of our current political climate. Sadly, it's no surprise that the FBI didn't follow-up on the more than 4500 calls to the FBI Tip Line about Kavanaugh, nor did they even interview her in their so-called investigation after her testimony. Along with Catch and Kill, One Way Back shines a spotlight on how abusive powerful men are protected.",5.0
295,Not Your China Doll: The Wild and Shimmering Life of Anna May Wong,,4.11,"['March', '12,', '2024']","Anna May Wong is clearly having her moment with a novelization of her life story (The Brightest Star) and two major biographies (Daughter of the Dragon by Yunte Huang and this title) appearing within one year. I've had the fortune of reading both of the biographies, and they are certainly both worth your time. Not your China Doll is the more novelistic and warmer of the two accounts while Huang's account is a bit colder and academic and is as interested in contextual digressions (e.g. chinese laundries, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek, expat life in China) as it is in Wong's story. Salisbury's account mostly sticks with the protagonist, but has a major (and worthwhile) digression regarding MGM's production of The Good Earth, which is notable for not casting Anna May Wong.It's pretty clear that the author intends this book as a celebration of the life of an extraordinary woman who for at least her first thirty-five years made the very best use of her talents and allure that a racist system could accommodate. For the most part she is successful, but the what-might-have-beens still creep through to the reader, causing us to wonder how much Wong and the film-going public missed out on. And unfortunately, the chronological nature of biography still causes this story to end on a downbeat as we see Anna May Wong's very sad booze-laden last twenty years or so till her death in 1961, just before she was supposed to be in the movie version of The Flower Drum Song. If you are intrigued by Anna May Wong, you won't go wrong with this book.

296,Shakespeare's Sisters: How Women Wrote the Renaissance,,3.93,"['March', '12,', '2024']",I got this book for a review on netgally. I was instantly interested to read this non fiction when I saw it. Women who wrote and published works when a time it wasn't very accessible for women to be writers? Instantly intruiged. Very informative about different women and their lives and others. It sometimes felt a bit heavy with all the info but that's quite common for me and non fiction. I didn't know about them before so always great to learn something new.,4.0

It’s fair to say Pete is his own worst enemy and honesty is not his strong suit. His spectacular fall from grace is on him and this nonfiction book about Pete’s childhood, professional career, and scandals makes that apparent.

298,Cloistered: My Years as a Nun,,3.83,"['March', '7,', '2024']","I love reading about the secret culture of nuns, and since this was an actual memoir I was even further intrigued. A young woman in her twenties found refuge in the Catholic Church after the death of her father. She joined the Carmelite order, embracing the silence. Her ""cell"" which was her assigned bedroom in Akenside Priory was a safe haven, with its large, spare black cross, its white walls, rolling hills of greenery out the window, and most of all- its solitary quiet. However, during her twelve years within its confines, Catherine experienced cliques, politics, unfairness, and power plays. I felt a bit detached reading the many passages that went into the weeds about the deep religious concepts. It was all ""over my head"" and I didn't feel like delving into those tenets. There was also a lot of talk about nature because of the locale of the monastery and the necessity of the nuns working the property, tending the gardens. I'm not a fan of extensive conversation and description about nature either. I did feel a kinship with Catherine feeling the peace and quiet of her room, as she gazed out her window at the gentle, rolling fields. I enjoyed learning about the intake process and inner workings of living the Carmelite order, including the schedules for each day. The person who was the most gifted at cooking quite possibly would not be the one assigned to cook. I loved hearing about the bread baking, mixing up dried milk (because it was cheaper), having a ""Little Jug"" (a quick, small breakfast eaten standing up before chores), and the half hour set aside for conversation each day. It was very disturbing hearing about some of the diabolical maneuverings.This book clocked in at just over 350 pages, which felt pretty long. If some of the religious philosophical meanderings and nature talk could have been excised out, I would have enjoyed this memoir even more, as it was a pretty interesting story.Thank you to the publisher St. Martin's Press who provided an advance reader copy via NetGalley.",3.0

In the rarest of reading experiences, what started as excellent, turned brighter, stronger and more powerful with every page.

300,A Very Private School: A Memoir,"In this poignant memoir, Charles Spencer recounts the trauma of being sent away from home at age eight to attend boarding school.",4.26,"['March', '12,', '2024']","I've long been fascinated by the nature of evil. It seems that evil can be tackled only when humans understand its deceptiveness. One truism is that evil is often to be found hidden beneath convincing veneers of caring authority. It's one of the best covers that exists. And what is more evil than destroying and crushing a vulnerable child? Charles Spencer (otherwise known as Earl Spencer) offers a searing, uncompromising account of some highly formative years spent at a boarding prep school, Maidwell Hall, in England in the 1970s. The traditional tendency of the upper classes in England to send their children to such boarding schools at ridiculously young ages is well known. Less well known is the fact that these students were often subjected to the same sadistic brutality that seemed to be accepted in many educational institutions up until at least the early 1980s (in Ireland also). Although I prefer reading paper books, as I find audiobooks fairly hit and miss, I suspected the quality of the narration would be high in this case, as it was the author reading. He has been known for strong, powerful delivery of uncomfortable truths since his eulogy at his sister Princess Diana's funeral many years ago, which somehow managed to be full of righteous anger and dignified at the same time. Similar could be said of this book.Spencer doesn't shy away from providing disturbing details of the sadism and perversions of some staff at Maidwell, as well as the horrendous life-long emotional impact it had on the students as they went on in life. I've always admired his commitment to staring reality in the face, but this takes things to a whole new level. It starts a conversation that is probably long overdue in England about children's emotional welfare and how boarding schools affect their relationships and ability to be intimate in later life. The details of this book are disturbing in the extreme, with Spencer himself going into a lot of depth about the assistant matron who predated on himself and other boys in her charge, causing them extreme confusion and essentially stealing an important part of their childhood. Details about the school's headmaster are highly unsettling, and it's clear he was a predator also, who was clever at disguising this fact to parents with jaunty school reports. Parents were regularly deceived into thinking he was a genial man with humorous insights about their children, and that he cared deeply about their welfare. Spencer, on the other hand, describes how men still had visible stripes from vicious canings well into mid-life, not to mention the psychological scars to accompany them.The book also describes the obligatory violent teacher who hates the boys because of his class hangups about their upper-class backgrounds. It's a stark reminder of the fact that child abuse is no respecter of social rank. Abusers will find their interal excuses one way or another to defend the indefensible.This is a depressing, sorry tale on one level. However, it also offers a huge spark of hope for the future of education and therefore humanity generally. It's not a book that can be ignored by the establishment, given who wrote it, and what it must have taken emotionally to put the words on paper so powerfully. The interviews with other Maidwell students from that time are equally poignant and often heartbreaking, with some men's lives irretrievably ruined due to their time in the school. This book is an impressive achievement on the part of Charles Spencer, a person who has had more than his fair share of upheaval and loss. He has gifted the world with difficult truths more than once, and everyone should thank him for this unflinching courage.",5.0

Millions are sure that the “deep state” is plotting to import immigrants to vote against “real ­Americans” in the future. Meanwhile in Russia, the majority of people claim that the Kremlin is the innocent party in its brutal invasion of Ukraine. When Ukrainians call their relatives in Russia to tell them about the atrocities, all too often they hear their own kin parrot the Kremlin’s propaganda lines: the atrocities are faked, or false flags, or necessary in order to impose Russia’s greatness.Across the world we see the growth of propaganda that promotes an alternative reality where black is white and white is black, and where truth is cast away in favour of a sense of superiority and ever more murderous paranoia.”Please go read the rest of this review of [How to Win an Information War: The Propagandist Who Outwitted Hitler] here: https://www.theguardian.com/books/202...",
302,A Good Bad Boy: Luke Perry and How a Generation Grew Up,,3.27,"['March', '5,', '2024']","Of course I had a crush on Luke Perry’s iconic character Dylan McKay in Beverly Hills 90210. I mean, I used to be a warm-blooded preteen when I first saw the troubled brooding rich “bad boy” with the heart of gold, a white t-shirt and a pompadour, and a full forehead of furrows that gave me very unrealistic expectations for how sixteen-year-old teenagers should look and act. And that former teen girl in me was definitely not about to miss Perry’s biography. 
 “His sorrows are many, but it’s much cuter to be sad driving around in a Porsche than in a broken-down Chevy.”



And I’m not even ashamed that I knew almost exactly every detail of Dylan scenes from the first three seasons or so that the book mentioned — those first seasons that were so endearingly sincere and not yet soap opera of the rich and famous. (Out of his other roles, I’ve seen a couple of movies and that’s it). 
 “The squeaky-clean Midwestern twins, Brandon and Brenda (played by Jason Priestley, a Canadian actor cast at the eleventh hour, and Shannen Doherty, a child actress who’d gone edgy with Heathers), needed a dark counterpoint. Enter Dylan McKay, whose antecedents included Judd Nelson, Matt Dillon, and James Dean. And before them, all the tortured poets who’d tried to catch ecstasy through adventure and verse: Rimbaud, Lord Byron, Bukowski. Dylan was a pocket version of those larger-than-life types, scaled down for high school.”


Margaret Wappler is clearly a fan, and she shows Luke Perry as an unequivocally good man who’s made a positive impact on a variety of people he came in contact with; a down-to-earth guy not corrupted by fame; a professional taking his job seriously; a colleague friendly and respectful to everyone on set; a dear friend always ready to give support to those who needed it. Gone way too soon from this world, just at 52 from a stroke, he left a big empty space in the hearts of those close to him.I think I would have genuinely loved having Luke Perry as a friend.
 There was “never a diva move” from Luke, Fontana says. “I don’t think he was capable of it.” 
But it’s not just a book about Luke Perry. I should have been clued in by the second part of the title —“How a Generation Grew Up”. Well, not quite a story of a generation, really, but one person - Margaret Wappler herself, with chapters on Perry alternating with Wappler’s memoir (or at least memoir-like story), with no connection to Perry other than she watched the show when she was a teen, and little there of interest to me. And the addition of this memoir just did not hold my interest, leaving me thinking that these pages could have been instead spent on a deeper dive into Perry’s life as this book, even though respectful to Perry, often seemed much too superficial, and in the end I learned more about Wappler than about Perry — which wasn’t what I was expecting. (But maybe there was not that much material there, given that Wappler mentions that Perry’s family and his 90210 colleagues declined participation in this book — and therefore maybe it needed padding to be more than a long magazine piece). That titular generation growing up — yeah, that was pretty much Wappler describing her life which really is a stretch to apply to more than that one specific person. 2.5 stars. More Perry biography and less Wappler memoir, please. It’s wasn’t a good mix. That was my feeling at the end.(But I do appreciate the instant identification with the ONLY correct way to peel a banana, Luke Perry and I fully agree here:
 “And for God’s sake, don’t peel a banana from the stem. When Ari and her sister Camrey Bagley Fox, who also appeared in the film (plus two of their younger siblings), prepped breakfast in one scene, Luke caught them denuding the fruit in this most upsetting manner. Do as the monkeys do, he told them, and start from the other end with a small pinch. A decade later, Bagley says, “every time I eat a banana, I think, ‘Luke Perry,’ and I can’t open one by the stem anymore.”

303,Waiting for the Monsoon,,4.25,"['March', '5,', '2024']","A foreign correspondent, diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, looks back at a remarkable life of overcoming adversity and reporting from war zones. Nordland has already outlived his surgeon's prognosis by more than three years, taking advantage of what he calls his ""Second Life"" to cultivate gratitude and healthy habits, and, of course, to write this. Growing up in poverty with a physically abusive father encouraged self-sufficiency. Much of the book is given over to stories from the field. Nordland thrived on excitement, and conveys the thrill and danger to readers. Part II, ""After the Monsoon,"" marks an inevitable change of pace as the author considers the setbacks of the past few years. Overall, I was more interested in his upbringing and cancer journey than in his wartime experience, but others will feel differently. By virtually anyone's standards, though, he has lived a fascinating life, full of hardship but consistently hopeful. (More of a 3.5, really.)See my full review at BookBrowse.

304,Where Rivers Part: A Story of My Mother's Life,,4.54,"['March', '19,', '2024']","Thank you, @atriabooks, for the gifted book. I also purchased the audio from Libro.fm for an incredible read/listen. About the book: “A mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful memoir about a Hmong family’s epic journey to safety told from the perspective of the author’s incredible mother who survived, and helped her family escape, against all odds.”If you read and loved Kristin Hannah’s The Women, or if it’s high on your TBR and you long to read it, you absolutely should read it. I loved that book! At the same time, I urge you to add Where Rivers Part to your reading list. Kay Kalia Yang’s parents were born in war torn Laos during the time The Women was set. Do you remember the people living in the mountain villages in the book? This is the same ethnic group. Sometimes readers are reluctant to pick up memoirs or biographies, but Where River Parts reads better than most any fictional novel, and it happens to be real. It has dialogue, action, family dynamics, culture, powerful emotion, and so much heart. It’s a beautiful thing that the author penned this book for her mother, written in her mother’s voice. It’s especially poignant on audio. Tswb, the author’s mother, longs to be reunited with her own mother. Unfortunately, that does not happen until years after she has passed away. I won’t spoil it for you, but Tswb’s journey continues until the very last page.Where Rivers Part is an ode to mothers, a meditation on storytelling, and a powerful story of sacrifice. It’s quite simply one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read, and I urge everyone to read it for a firsthand account by a Hmong author.Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader",5.0
305,"Learning to Think: A Memoir of Faith, Superstition, and the Courage to Ask Questions",,4.11,"['March', '7,', '2024']","Briefly - A remarkable tale of an intensely personal lifeIn fullThis is an intensely personal memoir about Tracy's life mostly relating to when she was younger, mostly in her teens. It is remarkable for its openness and, under the circumstances its balance. There is a ""born again"" Christian part of this and aspects of her childhood and early on her teen years to a degree were quite happy. However under the surface things were not always that good. The book opens with her being exorcised of her demons by to men from her church. Her father had difficulties with work in part due to his alcoholism. Her mother had mental health issues and Tracy was often acting a support for her. Her older sister had issues with school attendance and was placed into care. Add in the fact that her father was murdered and I find it remarkable that Tracy can writes such an account of her life.The more I look back on reading this the less I like the idea of passing judging on this in terms of ratings. On platforms that allow no rating that is what I will do. In no way is this intended as a judgement on this book, simply the fact that I fail to see what right I have to ""review"" in that way the life that Tracy had. The contrasts in Tracy life are wide and varied. The fact that she managed to get through to where she is now speaks volumes for her as a person. However it also says a lot to me about the positives from her early life often provided by her parents.I really liked the fact that there is some humour here too. While Tracy found that conventional education didn't work for her (any more than it had for her sister) she didn't let little things like that stop her - I loved her description of the German exam she took having only done one class on the subject in the whole year. For me it said quite a lot about her and in a positive way.I found this very readable however the book changed for me around 75% through to something that went up a level. Having maybe got on top of the real issues in her life Tracy decides she wants to look further at her father's murder. I was frankly amazed at the way she dealt with this aspect - again it says a great deal about her as a person. Worth bearing in mind that Tracy says""…trauma like mine is not rare. What is rare is that someone like me has an opportunity to tell her story"". Sadly I think that is very true and for that alone this book is important.I'd like to return to the title of this book - Learning to Think. To me it's a very good title and maybe is key to Tracy's life and ability to recover in the broadest sense from the events in her early life. It fascinated me (and I was slightly envious) that her father used to give them ""logic"" problems to solve. I guess as an engineer of sorts this was something quite basic to him. I do feel that set a wonderful foundation for her ability to think. After that came people she met and engaged with (rarely school based). After that she started reading quite deep and profound books. I can't judge what worked for Tracy but these feel like significant factors on her life journey to me.This really is a unusual and remarkable read. There are plenty of parts of this book that I made notes on and might comment on however it is far better to discover her story for yourself. It won't be for everyone however I'm guessing that quite a few people will finds aspects of this resonate with them. It made me smile, it made me angry, it made me sad and sincerely I thanks Tracy for sharing her story.Note - I received an advance digital copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair review",
306,Finding Me,,4.56,"['April', '26,', '2022']","This has got to be my favorite read of the year. I loved Viola Davis before, but now I’m IN love with her. The immense respect and admiration I have for her is deep. The things she endured as a kid, teen, woman—period. I can honestly say that I’ve never experienced. I’ve never missed a meal for days. I’ve never had to lie in my own urine and go to school the next day reeking. I’ve never had to fight with huge rats over my bed & pillow. I’ve never witness my father beat my mom within an inch of her life and I’ve never experienced racism on the level that Viola has for being too dark. What she went through for being dark skinned, what her mom went through as a child..absolutely horrific. “Memories are immortal. They’re deathless and precise. They have the power of giving you joy and perspective in hard times. Or, they can strangle you. Define you in a way that’s based more in other people’s tucked-up perceptions than truth.”The colorism she experienced in the acting world and how they tried to “mold and shape” her into the perfect “white” actor. I love how she explained what Shonda Rhimes did for her in creating HTGAWM role for her and the healing that came from that. “Annalise Keating released in me the obstacles blocking me from realizing my worth and power as a woman.”“As Black women, we are complicated. We are feminine. We are sexual. We are beautiful. We’re pretty. There are people out there who desire us. We are deserving. So that’s why I’m very aware of what my presence means. And that’s why I’m also aware of why I need to be emotionally healthy. Because that’s a lot of responsibility. Because you’re coming up against a four-hundred-year-old narrative.” How to Get Away with Murder was where my radical transformation took place. In the course of playing Annalise, I understood that I was no longer and never was that ugly Black nigga. The role liberated me. I said to myself: All I’ve got is me. And that is enough.",5.0
307,A Promised Land,,4.34,"['November', '17,', '2020']","Our expectations for elected officials aren’t always very realistic, and none more than for those elected to the highest office in our country. We’ve never had a perfect President and never will, but there are certain qualities that I believe are essential. Intelligence, a respect for the office and more importantly a reverence for our democracy, a strong sense of responsibility for protecting our nation and its citizens, leadership skills that bring together qualified people in the government, a recognition that we have a role to play as citizens of the world, to name a few. Former President Barack Obama was not a perfect President, but I believe that he embodied all of these things that I expect in a President and I believe that even more now, after listening to this book.No matter what you think about Barack Obama, the man can write! It’s illustrated in this first volume of his memoir, as well as the other books he’s written. There are beautiful descriptions of walking along the promenade from the White House residence to the West Wing, the Rose Garden, the Oval Office, intimate descriptions of his family life, his love for his wife and daughters, his love for his deceased mother and grandparents. My favorite introspective passage is the following quote which I played over and over to be sure I got the words right, but also because they represent in such a meaningful way how he viewed his enormous responsibility. “ I would never fully rid myself of the sense of reverence I felt when ever I walked Into the Oval Office, the feeling that I entered not an office, but a sanctum of democracy. Day after day it like comforted and fortified me reminding me of the privilege of my burdens and my duties. “My favorite parts of the book were early on when he talked about making the decision to run and the stories of the campaign were just so fascinating, funny at times and so informative. Michelle asked him just before he announced that he would run , “Why you?” Obama responded that if he became President, “the world would look at America differently, that kids , Black and Hispanic or kids who don’t fit in will see themselves differently, their horizons lifted, their possibilities expanded .” I enjoyed so much hearing about the grass roots campaign, using the internet, how the field organizers in Iowa worked was just fascinating. With love and respect, he tells of his relationships with David Axelrod, Robert Gibbs, the young Reggie Love and David Pfluffe, who Obama thought was so brilliant that he became his Campaign Manager and so many others. I loved hearing the origins of “Fired up ! Ready to Go ! “ Always prepared, he wrote both a concession and acceptance speech.” The book is also laden with dense discussions on the economic crisis the country was facing when he took office, his first G20 conference, foreign policy, health care and the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the war in Afghanistan. I have to admit that there were some chapters where I sped up the audio, but for anyone who is a policy wonk, these might be more interesting. These chapters, though, reflect the complexity of the issues before him and the country at this time. They also reflect the intelligent, pragmatic yet caring ways he approached things.Barack Obama always felt the weight of the office and the responsibility to protect the nation, the huge responsibility of being Commander in Chief, the casualties of troops in Afghanistan, writing letters to their families. He read security briefings every morning, and then had meetings with security staff right after - imagine that ! (Couldn’t help myself.) This narrative reflects part of his first term and I can’t wait for the second volume. I love this man . I cried when he won in 2008, a good, heartfelt cry and I cried when his second term was over, a sad and horrified cry. ( Again , I couldn’t help myself.) I have missed him every single day since January 20, 2017. Clearly, I’m biased so you might want to read it yourself, and I do highly recommend it .",5.0
308,The Happiest Man on Earth,,4.62,"['July', '28,', '2020']","Wow. It’s difficult to put this one into words. From the moment Holocaust survivor, Eddie Jaku, addressed me, the reader, as his friend, I felt emotional. The Happiest Man on Earth was both heartbreaking and inspiring. It was a fairly quick, but powerful read that I couldn't put down. I found myself re-reading certain passages to absorb and wrap my head around all that Eddie was sharing. It’s simply told, yet paints a vivid picture of his journey. It felt so intimate, like he was sitting down with me, his new friend, and telling me about his remarkable life. From the likes of Buchenwald and Auschwitz; to escapes, near-death experiences and starting over in a new country. There is inspiration to be found throughout - even in the darkness. It’s about family, love, kindness, friendship and so much more.“Every breath is a gift. Life is beautiful if you let it be. Happiness is in your hands.”Perhaps no other book has made me feel so grateful to be alive and appreciate friends and family. It's not just an astonishing tale of tragedy and survival (Eddie was given a 35% chance to live upon liberation), but inspiring story of how to rebuild after the worst kind of adversity. You can’t help but want to be a better member of society.“With a simple act of kindness, you can save another person from despair, and that might just save their life. And this is the greatest miracle of all.”The pictures brought to life those featured in the book and reinforced the tragedy and loss that so many, like Eddie, endured. This is more than just his story. My heart ached for them all and I won't forget them.“The best balm for the soul is friendship.”I had to sit in silence and collect my thoughts after finishing The Happiest Man on Earth. It’s the kind of book you wake up thinking about. A book to make you immediately go hug your mother or father; a friend or a pet. It will be a book I return to when needing some hope, inspiration or encouragement to be a better person. On speaking about the horrors of the Holocaust and sharing his story, Eddie had this to say:“If I get through to even one person, it is worth it. And I hope that is you, my new friend. I hope this story goes with you.”Yes, my friend, your story will certainly stay with me forever.",5.0

310,Bad Mormon: A Memoir,,3.51,"['February', '7,', '2023']","I’m a fan of the “celebrity” memoir, and this is possibly the worst one I’ve read. Certainly the worst book this year. That it’s badly written is a given, but it is so BORING. This is very likely ghostwritten and it is so dense with mixed metaphors and heavy-handed references, it was almost painful to read at points. This is not the story of someone who has fundamentally struggled with her religion, who has to grapple with the understanding that faith is not enough to keep her tied to a church that is actively harming its people. Gay reiterates (ad nauseum) that, while she was ambitious and outspoken, she was still very tied to the Mormon religion. She deeply felt a communion with god and had sublime religious experiences; any moments of embarrassment or confusion were quickly glossed over. Gay is an odd duck on RHOSLC and her memoir does nothing to flesh this out. Her marriage fails because, as Gay mentions, they are fundamentally incompatible but she gives examples in the most unflattering ways. Her epiphany comes because her husband walked out of a particularly gross scene in Scream 3. She realized her marriage was a failure on her honeymoon bc her husband walked out of an empty theatre during Scream 3. My god. She also complains about how he doesn’t spend his family money, and doesn’t agree with her throwing money around to out-do the Joneses. Obviously, if you can afford a pj and you choose Southwest, you’re a horrible husband who borders on abuse. The only interesting parts of the book were towards the end when she starts covering RHOSLC. She manages to shittalk all her cast mates while also kissing their asses. Just like the show.",1.0

312,Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon,,3.80,"['October', '3,', '2023']","Full reviewIn Michael Lewis’s Going Infinite, he compares FTX’s CEO-in-bankruptcy’s attempts to sift through the remains of the fallen FTX empire to an ignorant amateur archaeologist trying to fabricate believable explanations for artifacts beyond his understanding.A writer of Lewis’s caliber presumably also knows of many parables about people who get too close to a subject to be able to view it objectively, too, but those don’t earn a place in the book. At no point does Lewis seem to reflect on whether the six months he spent shadowing Bankman-Fried prior to the CEO’s fall from grace — during which Lewis thought he was writing the story of a nerdy tycoon’s rise to unimaginable wealth and influence in a possible new sector of finance — may have influenced his own evaluation of the situation. The time Lewis spent observing Bankman-Fried in the company’s ritzy Bahamian offices, joining him on travels abroad, and even accompanying him to parties where they brushed elbows with the likes of Hillary Clinton and Leonardo DiCaprio certainly seems to have endeared the fallen billionaire and now accused fraudster to Lewis, who throughout the book continuously overlooks red flags and omits context that would paint a very different picture.To this day, Bankman-Fried claims that the collapse of FTX, and the more than $8 billion in missing customer funds, is all the result of mismanagement and sloppy record-keeping, but not intentional fraud. By writing a book that largely backs up Bankman-Fried’s claims, Lewis seems to be staking his own substantial reputation on this being the truth — or, at least, on the government being unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it isn’t. If Bankman-Fried is convicted in the upcoming trial, Lewis’s book will take an awkward place on the shelves of history.",1.0
313,Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty,,3.83,"['September', '21,', '2021']","Journalist Anderson Cooper, scion of the (once) fabulously wealthy Vanderbilt family, was silent about his heritage for most of his life. Then, when Anderson's mother Gloria Vanderbilt reached her nineties, Cooper published the book The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss - which details his mother's fascinating history.Anderson Cooper and Gloria VanderbiltThe Vanderbilts are a larger-than-life clan that made and squandered huge fortunes over the generations. After the death of his mother, Cooper was going through her boxes of journals, documents, letters, and other memorabilia, and he 'began to hear the voices of his ancestors.' Wanting to know more, Cooper decided to research his heritage. This book, written with historian Katherine Howe, is the result. Cooper's ancestors arrived in the New World in the 1600s, when a Dutch farmer named Jan Aertsen van der Bilt ('from the Bilt'), arrived in New Amsterdam (the future New York).New Amsterdam in the 1600sBy the 1700s Jan Aertsen's descendant Jacob van der Bilt lived in Staten Island, and this branch of the family gave rise to Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt - the man who made the family's initial fortune. Cornelius started out by running ferry boats on the Staten Island waterfront in the early 1800s, when he was eleven years old. Commodore Cornelius VanderbiltYoung Cornelius ran ferries on the Staten Island waterfront in the 1800sCornelius then graduated to running steamboats between New York and New Jersey at the age of twenty-three, and went on to establish a vast shipping and railroad empire.Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt built a railroad empireCooper and Howe write, ""Commodore Vanderbilt was a master manipulator, disseminator, and inventor of his own legend [who] reveled in attention, in being feared by men in business with him and, certainly by men in business against him. He was feared also by his children, whose lives he dominated. More than anything else, however, the Commodore thrived on money. When his final breath escaped his body, this man would leave behind a veritable monument of money."" In fact the Commodore left $100 million, the equivalent of more than $2 billion today.Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt was obsessed with moneyThe Commodore left most of his estate to his favorite son Billy ""the blatherskite"" Vanderbilt, to the dismay of the other siblings.Billy ('the blatherskite') Vanderbilt, the Commodore's favorite sonThe dark side of wealth had already started to plague the family, as shown by the Commodore's namesake Cornelius II, who was a terrible businessman, habitual gambler, and big spender who was always in debt.Cornelius Vanderbilt II, the Commodore's namesakeThe Commodore wanted to leave his money to a son that would make his fortune grow, not fritter it away. And Billy the blatherskite did just that, which helped him shoehorn the Vanderbilts into New York's elite. In the 1800s, New York high society was governed by snobs and nobs who didn't welcome the nouveau riche into their ranks. The authors write, ""The Commodore, despite his wealth, had been a boor. His manners had been coarse. He chewed tobacco; he could barely read."" Though the Commodore built his house near New York's most fashionable neighborhood, Washington Square, ""he never tried to soften his calloused edges to gain acceptance by the city's oldest and wealthiest families."" Billy changed all this. Billy increased the Vanderbilt fortune, and was determined to use his wealth to infiltrate New York's beau monde. Denied a box at the Academy of Music, where high society attended the opera and important balls, Billy organized the construction of the Metropolitan Opera House, which opened in 1880.Metropolitan Opera House in New YorkCooper and Howe observe, ""The Met pulled out all the decorative stops, presenting a plush riot of gilding, gas-lit crystal, and warm red velvet, like the rich lining of a jewelry case, designed to maximize the sparkle of the gems presented within. Next to the newly built opera house, the Academy looked downright shabby."" Pretty soon the old New York families rented boxes at the Met, and the Academy of Music shut down. The Vanderbilts had joined the ranks of the smart set.Elegantly dressed patrons of the Metropolitan Opera HouseBilly the blatherskite was the last Vanderbilt to add to the family fortune, with subsequent generations diddling the money away. Vanderbilts built mansions, palazzos, and chateaus - exemplified by The Breakers in Rhode Island; raised horses; purchased yachts; threw lavish parties; and so on. And the men (of course) supported mistresses. The Breakers in Rhode Island (a Vanderbilt mansion) is now a tourist attractionA postcard of the Cornelius Vanderbilt III steam yacht, ""North Star""For example, the authors describe a surreal costume ball thrown by Alva Erskine Smith Vanderbilt, Billy the blatherskite's daughter-in-law.Alva Vanderbilt (Billy the blatherskite's daughter-in-law) In 1883, Alva was in the midst of a campaign to rule New York society, and planned a lavish party for 1200 guests in her and her husband Willie's Fifth Avenue mansion.Alva and Willie Vanderbilt's 'petit chateau' at 660 Fifth AvenueCooper and Howe note, ""The palatial house at 660 Fifth Avenue would be full to overflowing with hothouse orchids out of season and American Beauty roses by the thousands.....At two in the morning, an eight-course supper created by the chefs from Delmonico's was served in the gymnasium on the third floor, which had been festooned into a riotous imagination of a tropical forest....At either end of the grand apartment babbled two artificial fountains, filling the air with the plashing of freshwater under the clink of crystal and fine china and silver."" The guests arrived dressed as Joan of Arc, Christopher Columbus, Louis XVI, Queen Elizabeth I, the goddess Diana, Daniel Boone, a bumblebee, kings, queens, fairies, toreadors, gypsies, and more. Alva herself was arrayed in the regalia of a Venetian princess, complete with a fabulously expensive rope of real pearls that (purportedly) had belonged to Catherine the Great. Some costumes worn to Alva Vanderbilt's costume ballAlva Vanderbilt dressed as a Venetian princess for her costume ballAlva also engaged two orchestras, and chosen guests danced themed quadrilles, including the Hobbyhorse Quadrille, the Mother Goose Quadrille, the Dresden China Quadrille, and so on. A Quadrille DanceThe cost of Alva Vanderbilt's festive ball was a quarter of a million dollars, about $6.4 million in today's money.Alva was also notorious for being the first New York society doyenne to divorce her cheating husband Willie Vanderbilt. Willie Vanderbilt (Alva Vanderbilt's husband)According to Alva, a wealthy man of the time would marry a carefully groomed society woman for sex, children and respectability. Then, when physical passion waned, the wife ""was set aside, relegated to a stupid domestic sphere"", while the man strayed. Thus Willie freely entertained other women, ""anyone he wished, on his yacht or wherever he chose."" Alva would have none of it, and - though it would result in her being (temporarily) snubbed by society - Alva took Willie to divorce court. Alva's nerve broke the logjam, and other socialites soon followed her example and divorced their husbands. Alva was not a 'nice' woman. She admitted to mistreating slaves and forced her daughter Consuelo to marry a British aristocrat Consuelo didn't love.Consuelo Vanderbilt (daughter of Alva and Willie) Though Alva had her faults, she was a force of nature that went on to push for women's equality and women's suffrage. In her later years, Alva Vanderbilt supported women's rights and women's suffrageCooper and Howe feature additional memorable Vanderbilts in chapters about the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 (Alfred Vanderbilt went down with the ship);Sinking of the LusitaniaAlfred Gwynne Vanderbilt went down with the Lusitaniathe America's Cup yachting race of 1934 (Harold Vanderbilt competed); America's Cup Race (1934);Harold Vanderbilt competed in the 1934 America's Cup raceand the social rise and fall of the famous writer Truman Capote (Gloria Vanderbilt was a friend). Capote exposed the foibles of his high society friends in his 1965 Vanity Fair story 'La Côte Basque'....and the smart set never forgave him. The Capote chapter - with numerous famous names - is chock full of great gossip. Some of the tangential sections stray from the strict subject of the Vanderbilt family, but they're interesting and illuminating.Writer Truman CapoteTruman Capote's 1965 story was his downfall in high societyTowards the latter part of the book, the authors write about Cooper's mother Gloria Vanderbilt, who was at the center of 'the custody battle of the century'; had a series of high profile husbands and lovers; was a model, fashion designer, and artist; lost and gained fortunes; endured sad tragedies; and was loved by her sons. Gloria's life is covered more thoroughly in Cooper's book 'The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Lost', so I'll leave it at that.Gloria VanderbiltThough the Vanderbilt name still evokes visions of wealth and power, the dynasty has fallen. Cooper and Howe sum it up as follows, ""The United States, a country founded on antiroyalist principles, would, only twenty years after its revolutionary burst into existence, produce the progenitor of a family [Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt] that would hold itself up as American royalty, with the titles and palaces to prove it. But their empire would last for less than a hundred years before collapsing under its own weight, destroying itself with its own pathology."" In addition to being a gossipy tale of the Vanderbilts, the narrative is brimming with entertaining anecdotes about other notable people as well as the culture of the times, ranging from early settlers of the New World to the 21nd century. The authors include a partial Vanderbilt family tree at the front of the book, which helps keep the family members straight. This is an excellent book that I'd recommend to celebrity watchers and readers interested in American history. You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com",4.0
314,Me,,4.33,"['October', '15,', '2019']","EDIT: I’m changing this to FIVE stars (from four). I keep recommending it and thinking about it and loving on Elton’s infectious and unique personality. I watched the movie last week and kept adding details where I thought they glossed over and narrating to my husband as we watched (haha sorry husband!) and it made me realize how much his book has stuck with me. Then we saw his concert which was phenomenal and now I just can’t get enough Elton in my life which tells me this book deserves ALL THE STARS!!!!Read the official autobiography: ✅Watch ‘Rocketman’: ✅See Elton John LIVE on his official farewell tour!: ✅“When you reminisce about the good old days, you naturally see it all through rose-tinted spectacles. In my case in particular, I think that’s forgivable, because I probably was literally wearing rose-tinted spectacles at the time, with flashing lights and ostrich feathers attached to them. But if you end up convincing yourself that everything in the past was better than it is now, you might as well give up writing music and retire.”This was marvelous. What an unapologetic, authentic, entertaining autobiography. I literally laughed out loud on more than a few occasions and even shed a few tears. I only wish I was more familiar with artists from the 1960s and 1970s so I could have had more context. I think for anyone who grew up listening to Elton and his peers, and even if you didn’t, this book will blow you away.Here’s hoping our show isn’t a “very occasional” one ☺️“I’ve played with my childhood heroes and some of the greatest artists in the history of music; I’ve played with people who were so hopeless they had no business being onstage and I’ve played with a group of male strippers dressed as Cub Scouts. I’ve done gigs dressed as a woman, a cat, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, a Ruritanian general, a musketeer, a pantomime dame and, very occasionally, I’ve played gigs dressed like a normal human being.”",5.0
315,Here After,,4.27,"['March', '5,', '2024']","I feel raw. This was absolutely breathtaking. Grief, mourning, pain, and heartache written in such a brutally forward manner. Devastatingly potent and emotionally honest. I cried multiple times.There are so many people I’ve lost to death recently, but this memoir made me think most about a friend, who I’ve had the deepest connection with (more than my parents or any significant others). And it made me long for him to come back to me. I miss him every day. I recognized so much in this book yet it is not my story. It’s Amy’s story through and through.This is a firecracker of a book and deserves all the praise it’s been getting. Stunning piece of writing with an psychologically naked approach. I took photos of multiple pages/passages. I’ve never read grief like this before. A new fave.—Full review coming",5.0
316,"Reality Check: Making the Best of The Situation - How I Overcame Addiction, Loss, and Prison",,4.38,"['December', '19,', '2023']","This book was the 2nd of my “24 Memoirs in 2024” and it is favorite so far. I was in my mid 20’s when Jersey Shore exploded on televisions everywhere. I was not a fan of Mike “The Situation”. I thought he was an arrogant jerk. I was into the first few seasons of Jersey Shore but then my interest faded. I wasn’t even interested in the revival that happened years later with Jersey Shore Family Reunion.Fast forward to 2019, I’m lying in bed recovering from a root canal infection and I see a Jersey Shore Family Vacation marathon on tv. I think to myself, “What the hell? I have nothing better to do.” I didn’t know if it was the fever from the infection or what, but all of a sudden I saw Mike in this new light. Who is this mature, respectful man I see? Big Daddy Sitch, that’s who. This memoir made me gasp, laugh, recoil, and cry. But, that’s what any good memoir will do to you. His story is told in an incredibly honest and painful way. As someone who has had family members that struggle with addiction, I could relate to nearly every character in Mike’s story. Feeling sympathy for Mike, wishing throughout the book that he’d get the help he needed. Feeling the frustration from family members as they relive each drug addled episode like the Groundhog Day from hell. Feeling profound disappointment when he was sentenced to prison after turning his life around. And feeling hope when Mike recited one of his many mantras, “Calm seas never made a good sailor”.If memoirs are your jam, please pick up this book. If you know and have seen Mike since the beginning of Jersey Shore, you will understand him completely after reading this book.Long Live Big Daddy Sitch.",5.0
317,My Name is Barbra,,4.24,"['November', '7,', '2023']","The publication day of this book will be the high holy day of 2023 for me.Actual Review:BEHOLD A PERFECT BOOK. 1,000/10, no notes.I read the hardback; my biceps thank her for the brief 6 day workout. I also listened to her read the audiobook herself (!!), which is perhaps one of the greatest gifts among a bounty of gifts she has given her fans.  A hand delivered basket of joy; that is my review of the audiobook.I could write the type of review I usually write, but I find I cannot with this particular book. I can only say: I have loved Barbra, unabashedly, since I was 12 years old; her defiance, resilience, boldness, self-determination, early and unwavering advocacy for women, LGBTQ+, and anyone who feels othered, her beauty, her elegance, that divine voice, the vulnerable parts of herself we could see through her performances; she is a part of my DNA, replicating endlessly, because she changed me, just as she has with millions of other super fans, by the mere fact that I was lucky enough to live in the time of Streisand, where she taught people - by her example and by the choices she made in her career - that there are no limits to how one can live a life, that there is delight in the non-traditional if one has courage. And all of those things are evident in the book as she gives the reader VIP access to her perspective on key events in her life and career, her rationale for certain decisions, her thoughts when recording certain songs (I cried when I read that she was thinking of the unfair treatment of the gay community when recording ""somewhere,"" as that song has always has special meaning to me for that reason, like a beacon of hope when things seemed hopeless, but I never knew she thought that, too. Have I mentioned how much I adore her?), hearing her correct the record on so many mistruths, and just witnessing her being the ultimate badass, a unicorn of the artistic world, even when she struggled - perhaps especially when she struggled. Barbra gives us a feast with this book. I cannot believe she shared so much of herself, so vulnerably, so beautifully. But then again, it's a Barbra book; of course it is peerless, just like the author herself.",5.0
318,Somehow: Thoughts on Love,,4.09,"['April', '9,', '2024']","A typical book of essays by Anne Lamott about life, love, and faith. I used to really love Anne Lamott's books, but I think they've all started to just feel kind of same-y to me.

319,The Secret Lives of Booksellers and Librarians: True Stories of the Magic of Reading,,4.08,"['April', '8,', '2024']","""[Community] libraries level the playing field.

Let your reach exceed your grasp. Whatever book you want to read, it's free on the honor system. It's hard to imagine anywhere else in our society so devoted to the concept of everyone being completely equal."" -- Cuyahoga County, Ohio managing librarian Bill Kelly, on page 304 Much like their previous winner Walk the Blue Line (excerpts on the lives of our police officers and sheriff's deputies from across the nation) earlier this year, bestselling author Patterson and U.S. Army vet Eversmann re-team to bring us another effort in a similar stylish vein with their newest entry called The Secret Lives of Booksellers and Librarians. As the title makes clear, this time they've spoken to dozens of folks in either the bookselling business (ranging from the owners of used book stores often found in small-town areas and up to the managers of Barnes & Noble businesses in major metropolitan areas) or libraries (working in various pubic schools systems or community-level branches in a nationwide array of cities or counties) in America. Those interviewed truly seem to love their chosen and/or happily accidental careers in the book-related arena, and love the magical power of reading plus then bringing it to the huddled masses yearning to be free. There are a number of notable stories / anecdotes - equally dispersed among heartwarming (a store owner unexpectedly receives assistance from customers after a storm wrecks his business), the humorous (the Nerf gun wielding patron often observed at the Seattle B&N) and even controversial (a high school librarian finds herself under attack regarding her staunch support of banned books) - and by the conclusion it was reassuring that there are sincere people fueled by the love books AND then providing them to people to simply make them happy.

320,Steve Jobs,,4.16,"['October', '1,', '2011']","Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie. He didn't much like to shower or wear shoes. He believed his diet kept him from getting stinky, not true apparently. In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange. This makes me wonder if these strange eating habits brought on his cancer. Who can say?Steve Jobs was an asshat.He was an ass to everyone, even Steve Wozniak, who by everyone's standards is one of the nicest guys there is. Wozniak was Job's only friend at times, and looked up to him always, but Jobs screwed him over time and again. Jobs didn't even claim his first born daughter (until much later) as his own even though there was no doubt she belonged to him. He also was a very emotional man, lots of crying and snot when he wanted something. Impossible to please, even down to the color of things. I seriously don't know how anything got finished, I really don't.Steve Jobs was a super genius.Despite of (or because of) all this he created the most amazing things. Because he demanded the impossible, he would get it. I love my Ipod and my Ipad. I'm very attached, I don't want to live without them. I use the Ipod for my audiobook and podcast addiction. I'm even learning how to draw caricatures on the Ipad.....so frik'n cool. Thank you Steve for being a damn dirty hippie, asshat super genius.

321,The Diary of a Young Girl,,4.19,"['January', '1,', '1947']","Why do we write reviews?You have a lot of reasons I guess.But for this review there is only one. I am writing this for my conscience. Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with-DO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresome.I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world. No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now?Well she didn’t survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back.",5.0
322,Becoming,,4.46,"['November', '13,', '2018']","Just to be up front, I voted for Barack in both 2008 and 2012, I’m male, not white, a naturally born citizen who generally vote Democrat. Since this book was written by a somewhat polarizing person I thought being upfront on who I am made sense in todays world of identity politics. Also, I borrowed my friends EPUB and read it on his computer which is why it doesn’t say “verified purchaser” next to my name and the references I have below is from that EPUB.I generally respect Michelle Obama and her accomplishments but there are a few things that bother me about her and this book.One, I got the vibe that she has some resentment towards white people, particularly white men. Sometimes she brings up race in a context that makes sense like when she is talking about how one issue effects black people more than white people or talking about history. Other times she’ll mention someone is white for no reason at all. Here are a few examples:-	Pg.1, paragraph 7.2 of the preface “working-class black student in a fancy mostly white college”-	Pg. 17, chapter 2 “I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady”. Why does her being white matter?-	Pg. 20, chapter 2, “My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent”. Why did she only describe that friend with a white mother and not the race of the rest?-	Pg.44, chapter 4, “Mr. Martinez and then Mr. Bennet, both gentle and good-humored African American men.” Ok, did it matter that were black in this context?-	Pg. 71, “mostly white students” Context? History? Why did this matter?-	Pg. 74, “one of the few nonwhite” -	Pg. 74, “my two white roommates in Pyne Hall were both perfectly nice…” Again, who cares if they were white?-	Pg. 75, “Cznery was a smart and beautiful black woman”. Why not just say beautiful? Why does black matter? It didn’t matter in her description in any historic or meaningful way.-	Pg. 120, “Now that I was at Sidley and on the other side of the recruiting experience, my goal was to bring in law students who were not just smart and hard-driving but also something other than male and white.” I get it, you want to make the place more diverse. Sure. But the way she said “other than make and white” got a lot under my skin (remember I’m not white).-	Pg. 148, “He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend” Ok, those white people again.-	Pg. 148, “In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago’s famous cronyism.” The old white guard? You mean just corrupt politicians right?-	Pg. 205, “Our counselor—Dr.Woodchurch, let’s call him—was a soft-spoken white man who’d gone to good school and always wore khakis”. Michelle, what the hell? Who cares if your counselor was white.-	Pg. 208, “The nervousness of white people”. Sigh.-	Pg. 218, “Its whiteness and maleness”. …Sigh.I get it. She was in the minority most of the time being black and a woman and when she puts things into historical or social context it makes sense pointing these things out as it represents systematic problems in our society when it comes to race. But other times she brings up race for no real reason. Never in her book did she directly talk about an incident where she was the direct receipt of discrimination that I read. In a lot of ways she seemed pretty lucky to not be a victim of some kind of racism in her life. If she did, she never really talked about it in her book so I’m wondering why she brings up race needlessly. Especially in a somewhat resentful way. Technically she is a baby boomer so perhaps she is a product of her time? I’m not black and I was born in the 80’s and not the 60’s so perhaps I never had to see the things she saw. Still, I don’t like her subtle resentment towards white people. I hope I’m wrong about her when it comes to this.Two, Michelle paints Barack as a super hero. I'm not joking. Every way she describes is literally perfect from being easy going and brainy, to being a huge reader, to memorizing everything to never being angry or upset or taking things seriously. I get it. Barack is cool, smart and an overall good guy. But come on, he must have some flaw (outside him smoking). Something that he did wrong, something that he truly messed up. The only thing I remember her saying about him was that he wasn't always on time and one time he blew a book deal (or missed the deadline or something) because he was busy with something else. I'm pretty sure Michelle and her husband agreed to paint him in the most perfect light ever to protect his presidency which makes me think she is being dishonest about her experience with him. Did Barack have a hand in writing this? Was Michelle censored in a way? Here are some examples of Michelle describing Barack as nothing less than perfect.-	Pg. 96. “What struck me was how assured he seemed of his own direction in life. He was oddly free from doubt,”-	“Instead lived like a sixteenth century mountain hermit, reading lofty works of literature and philosophy” pg. 97-	“Barack was serious without being self-serious. He was breezy in his manner but powerful in his mind. It was a strange, stirring combination.” Pg. 97-	“I found myself admiring Barack for both his self-assuredness and his earnest demeanor. He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant.” Pg. 97-	“Barack bore no resemblance to the typical eager-beaver summer associate (as I myself had been two years earlier at Sidley), networking furiously and anxiously wondering whether a golden-ticket job offer was coming. He sauntered around with calm detachment, which seemed only to increase his appeal.” Pg. 99-	“There was no arguing with the fact that even with his challenged sense of style, Barack was a catch. He was good-looking, poised, and successful. He was athletic, interesting, and kind.” Pg.99-	“He was modest and lived modestly, yet knew the richness of his own mind and the world of privilege that would open up to him as a result. He took it all seriously, I could tell. He could be lighthearted and jokey, but he never strayed far from a larger sense of obligation. He was on some sort of quest, though he didn’t yet know where it would lead.” Pg. 101-	“Barack had a smile that seemed to stretch the whole width of his face. He was a deadly combination of smooth and reasonable.” Pg. 103-	“He had an easy rapport with everyone at the firm. He addressed all the secretaries by name and got along with everyone—from the older, stuffier lawyers to the ambitious young bucks who were now playing basketball. He’s a good person, I thought to myself, watching him pass the ball to another lawyer.” Pg. 105-	“Having sat through scores of high school and college games, I recognized a good player when I saw one, and Barack quickly passed the test. He played an athletic, artful form of basketball, his lanky body moving quickly, showing power I hadn’t before noticed. He was swift and graceful, even in his Hawaiian footwear. I stood there pretending to listen to what somebody’s perfectly nice wife was saying to me, but my eyes stayed fixed on Barack. I was struck for the first time by the spectacle of him—this strange mix-of-everything man.” Pg. 105-	“Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I’d dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good. To me, he was sort of like a unicorn—unusual to the point of seeming almost unreal. He never talked about material things, like buying a house or a car or even new shoes. His money went largely toward books, which to him were like sacred objects, providing ballast for his mind. He read late into the night, often long after I’d fallen asleep, plowing through history and biographies and Toni Morrison, too. He read several newspapers daily, cover to cover. He kept tabs on the latest book reviews, the American League standings, and what the South Side aldermen were up to. He could speak with equal passion about the Polish elections and which movies Roger Ebert had panned and why”. Pg. 111-	“This, I was learning, was how Barack’s mind worked. He got himself fixated on big and abstract issues, fueled by some crazy sense that he might be able to do something about them. It was new to me, I have to say. Until now, I’d hung around with good people who cared about important enough things but who were focused primarily on building their careers and providing for their families. Barack was just different. He was dialed into the day-to-day demands of his life, but at the same time, especially at night, his thoughts seemed to roam a much wider plane.” Pg. 112-	“I was gripped all over again by a sense of how special he was.” Pg.117-	 “And now in Hawaii, I could see his character reflected in other small ways. His long-lasting friendships with his high school buddies showed his consistency in relationships. In his devotion to his strong-willed mother, I saw a deep respect for women and their independence. Without needing to discuss it outright, I knew he could handle a partner who had her own passions and voice.” Pg. 123-	“All this inborn confidence was admirable, of course, but honestly, try living with it. For me, coexisting with Barack’s strong sense of purpose—sleeping in the same bed with it, sitting at the breakfast table with it—was something to which I had to adjust, not because he flaunted it, exactly, but because it was so alive. In the presence of his certainty, his notion that he could make some sort of difference in the world, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit lost by comparison. His sense of purpose seemed like an unwitting challenge to my own.” Pg.131-	For better or worse, I’d fallen in love with a man with a vision who was optimistic without being naive, undaunted by conflict, and intrigued by how complicated the world was. He was strangely unintimidated by how much work there was to be done. He was dreading the thought of leaving me and the girls for long stretches, he said, but he also kept reminding me of how secure our love was. “We can handle this, right?” he said, holding my hand one night as we sat in his upstairs study and finally began to really talk about it. “We’re strong and we’re smart, and so are our kids. We’ll be just fine. We can afford this.” Pg.224I’ll stop quoting the book at this point. There are other examples on pages 115, 123, 152, 153, 180, 184, 192, 261, 265, and 322. There are probably others that I missed. Why does this annoy me you may ask? Because it sounds made up. Insincere. As if I was reading his resume or something his press secretary came up with. Is Barack even human or does he just possess every positive characteristic known to mankind with none of the baggage? Don’t get me wrong, I liked him from the get go since 2004 and his background is impressive (president of the Harvard Law Review specifically). But the way Michelle describes him just seems so made up and one-sided it makes me question the rest of the book.Here are some highlights about Michelle that I learned from the book (for whoever is interested):-	She told people she wanted to become a pediatrician when she was a kid because she loved being around kids and it was a pleasing answer to adults. She describes this later as always doing the correct thing.-	Her dad had MS (Multiple Sclerosis), a progressive disease that made him disabled and eventually killed him at 55. This hurt Michelle more than anything else to see her dad disabled and defeated.-	She had a very tight family and talked about anything, including her first period at the dinner table. Her brother was smart, cool and protective of her and she looked up to him. Her mom is an overwhelmingly positive force in her life.-	She smoked some pot in high school and was friends with Jessie Jacksons daughter.-	She failed the bar exam the first time around-	She very much dislikes politics-	She had a minor amount of marriage counseling with Barack, nothing serious though from what I could tell.-	She had problems bearing children and had to use intro vivo fertilization with Malia but not Sasha.-	Her kids are her top priority in life, especially when she was in the white house-	She tries to remain hopeful and never cynical though I don’t know if she is always successful.-	She graduated from Princeton then Harvard Law and started her career as a high powered lawyer however she never felt fulfillment from her job as a lawyer despite the money.Michelle is a pretty hardworking lady (somewhat of an overachiever) with a tight schedule that she sticks too. I remember her mentioning she got up at 5am, worked out, took her kids to school then went to work then picked them up from school (this was before she first lady). Her academic background is very impressive as she graduated from Princeton and Harvard Law. I found her mothers reaction to her not being fulfilled by her work as lawyer despite the money and prestige hilarious. It is almost something a millennial would say, not a baby boomer. First world problems! Growing up lower-middle class, her mother was annoyed. But, you can’t really blame Michelle either. Her work did sound boring and unfulfilling. She wasn’t making the positive impact she wanted too.  Michelle is deeply committed to her children. I’d argue that Malia and Sasha are the most important things to her and is her top priority, especially while she was first lady. She talked about them often in her book. Motherhood suites her well. If I were to describes Michelle’s life in one word is would be “busy” and one word to describe Michelle herself would be “workaholic”. She is obviously a likable person and likes many people in return.Bottom Line:To be blunt, I'm not sure why this book is getting 93% 5 stars. I just finished the book and I can't say I was particularly blown away like the ratings suggest. Michelle simply talked about her life, meeting Barack and her perspective of life in the white house which sounded boring from the way she describes it. She met many heads of states, worked hard spreading her message about good nutrition and empowering women but again, nothing interesting or fun. Towards the end of the book I was pretty much skimming through the words since I lost interest in what she was saying. I probably went 20 pages before I realized it and had to go back and reread. I got some insight to who Michelle was but in the end of the day I just thought to myself ""who cares?"". Shrug, I just didn't see anything particularly special or interesting about this book that would make me really recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even finished the book was simply to say “yeah, I read that book”. That being said, it isn’t a bad book either. It was well written, easy to follow and very detailed orientated. She mentioned many people’s name that she met over her life and how they influenced her. She remembered specific places, when she went there, details about those places and her experience there. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a special fascination with Michelle or first ladies in general. The book is fine. 3 out of 5 stars.	As a final note, I felt it was important that I wrote this review for two reasons. One, I depend on reviews to be fair, objective and honest. When I see a book get 500 reviews in 2 weeks with a near 95% of reviews being 5 stars on Amazon I knew something wasn’t right. 95% of people saying your book was 5 stars would mean this book should win the Pulitzer award. That means this book is amazing, a breakthrough, something that every person must read or they’ll miss out on a life experience. What if a truly amazing book is written one day? Something that is considered a classic? Something that blows the mind of society? What reviews does that book get? 99% instead of 95%? Seems stupid to me. 	Two, I wanted a review that judged more the book than the author. Michelle is a classy lady no doubt, but her book really isn’t that good. I didn’t want Amazon reviews to turn into a popularity contest where men rate this book highly, women another book, liberals another books, conservatives yet another book, democrats this book, republicans that book. Identity politics really annoys me. I hate that I had to preface this review with my “identity” but I had to otherwise I just would’ve been called an angry conservative republican white man. I think we should judge a book on the book alone and not the “identity” of the author. Of course considering the popularity of this author and the fact that this was a memoir it couldn’t be completely avoided. Hopefully my bias is at a minimum.So anyway like I said, book was fine. Not bad, not great. C+ or perhaps a B depending on how much you are interested in Mrs. Obama. Oh by the way this book has nothing to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him or his politics outside the whole “grab them by the pussy” remark Trump made a while back. So if anyone thinks this book is some attack on Trump or Republicans I can tell you it isn’t. Any review that says it is is obviously made up.",3.0
323,"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future",,4.17,"['March', '3,', '2015']","Elon Musk is not exactly a name that rolls easily off the tongue, like say Tony Stark, the fictional person to whom he is most often compared, or even Steve Jobs, a real-world visionary, whose mantle Musk now wears. There is no question that Musk is a special individual, someone with BIG dreams and the drive, talent, and money to make them happen. But, like Jobs, and Stark for that matter, he might be an acquired taste on a personal level. In Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future biographer Ashlee Vance gives us a picture of both the dreams and the man, peering back to where Musk began, describing his journey from then to now, looking at how he is impacting the world today, and gazing ahead to where he wants to go. It is a pretty impressive vista. Here is what it says on the SpaceX website
SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.
It might have seemed like visiting another planet when Musk split his home country of South Africa as a teen and headed to North America, anything to get away from an abusive upbringing. He seemed to have been blessed not only with exceptional analytical capabilities, and probably an eidetic memory, but an impressively immense set of cojones. He was able to talk his way into whatever he needed and deftly talk his way out of trouble as well. Sometimes that entailed a bit of truth-bending, but whatever. Ashlee Vance - from HarperCollins Vance take us from his adolescence as a computer geek, bullied at school, through his arrival in Canada, cold-calling to get work, putting together his first dot.com startup, and using the money from that to invest in a banking-oriented company that would become PayPal. It was the mega-bucks from the sale of PayPal that would allow him to begin realizing his big dreams. In 2003, Musk bought into Tesla, then a struggling startup. The company took the early knowledge that lithium ion batteries had gotten pretty good, added some top level engineering, design and programming talent, and, after plenty of mis-steps and struggles, brought the remarkable all-electric Tesla Roadster to the market in 2008. Tesla followed this with the Model S in 2012. Not only did Consumer reports call this a great car, it named both the 2014 and 2015 versions the best overall cars of their years, and the best car they had ever tested. The last time an auto startup succeeded in the USA was Chrysler, in the 1920s. But this is not about simply making a buck on a new car. The long term goal is to shift our petrochemical auto industry to renewable power, and the Tesla is a nifty start. Not only is the car amazing, the company has constructed a nationwide series of charging stations where Tesla owners can recharge their vehicles…for free. Tesla currently (August 2019) reports 1,604 such stations nationwide, with many more planned. Tesla is involved in building battery production factories, hoping to help support a growing electric-car auto-economy. Inside the Tesla Model S - from Tesla Motors But this was not the only big notion that drove Musk. A parallel effort was to develop a solar power business. And with the help of a couple of enterprising cousins, he did just that. SolarCity provides the solar arrays that provide power to the Tesla charging stations, but it has also become one of the largest solar utilities in the nation, installing, maintaining a third of the nation’s solar panel systems. There is obvious benefit to both Tesla and Solar City in sharing gains in battery and other technology. But I expect the third jewel in Musk’s crown is his favorite, SpaceX. Falcon 9 first stage attempting a controlled landing - from WikimediaMusk doesn’t have much going on here, nothing major, only an ardent desire to colonize Mars. But it takes the establishment of an infrastructure in order to be get from point E to point M. Musk saw an opening in the market for satellite launch vehicles. Existing rockets blast things up into orbit and then burn up on their way back down. His idea was to design a rocket that could make its way back to earth in one piece, to be reused. And he has. SpaceX is nearing its goal of launching at least one rocket a month. The manifest available on SpaceX.com lists missions to date. The company also designed a capsule called the Dragon that can be used for cargo, but also for astronauts. The cost of launching a satellite using a Falcon is a fraction of what other options charge. The next step is a larger launch vehicle. Space X has begun launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, offering the biggest load capacity since the Saturn V was last used in 1973. And, while this is definitely good for business in the relatively short term, one must always keep in mind that this is a stage in a bigger plan for Musk. Once the launch infrastructure is established, plans can begin to move forward to put together Mars missions. Not go, look, and explore sorts of adventures, but establishing a colony, a permanent human presence on the red planet. The Dragon Capsule, attached to the ISS - from Musk’s Twitter pageOf course when one has one’s eyes fixed on the stars (yes, Mars is a planet, I know, Geez), there is a large inclination to lose touch with earth-bound reality. In the movie, then play, then movie The Producers Max Bialystock, in order to cope with the absurd success of a play that was designed to fail, suggests to his partner, Leo Bloom, that one solution would be to do away with the cast. ""You can't kill the actors, Max! They're human beings,"" Leo says. ""Human beings? Have you ever seen them eat?"" Max replies. I suspect that there are more than a few folks who feel about Elon Musk the way Max felt about the actors. He is rather notorious for his insensitivity to anyone not living inside his head. For example, here is what potential recruits are told to expect when they meet with Musk.The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t panic. That’s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face you. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or fully acknowledge your presence. Don’t panic. That’s normal. In due course, he will speak to you.
Musk has an amazing capacity for work, putting in monstrous hours as a matter of course. But then he expects the same from those who work for him.
 The rank and file employees…revere his drive and respect how demanding he can be. They also think he can be hard to the point of mean and come off as capricious. The employees want to be close to Musk, but they also fear that he’ll suddenly change his mind about something and that every interaction with him is an opportunity to be fired. “Elon’s worst trait by far, in my opinion, is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection,” said one former employee. “Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared: maybe he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree. What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition: used for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.”
Musk even fired his loyal assistant, Mary Beth Brown, who had been with him for twelve years, after she asked for a raise. What a guy.Ego is certainly a big piece of the picture here. But I guess if you can do it, it ain’t bragging. Elon Musk is a larger than life figure, a computer geek, an engineer, an entrepreneur, and a dreamer, in addition to being a walking IED as someone to work for. He is one of the inspirations for Robert Downey‘s portrayal of Tony Stark in sundry Marvel Universe films. In fact, Downey came to visit Musk, specifically to get a taste of what a real billionaire techno-industrialist was like. Downey insisted on having a Tesla Roaster on the set of Iron Man, saying, ”Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.” Musk even had a cameo in Iron Man II. The resulting publicity from this connection did little to diminish Musk’s view of himself. Living the high-life in Tinseltown, hanging with, social, economic and media A-listers added more gas to the bag. Part of his ego issue is that he tends to take internal company timetables and announce them to the world as promises (I can see his entire staff jointly rolling their eyes, clutching palms to temples and issuing choruses of “Oh my god” and “WTF” as they spin in place), then holds his employees to those unreasonable schedules. Of course this results in many missed deadlines, much ingestion of antacid and probably the odd nervous breakdown or two.Musk, in an Iron Man II cameo - fromWiredMusk is the sort of guy who shows up with some regularity in science fiction novels, a genre trope, like the researcher who has exactly the sort of experience and insight the President/PM/Chairman/Secretary General needs in order to stave off global catastrophe. He’s the guy who has been secretly building the arc that the world needs to stave off extinction. In this case he is doing it publicly. Of course this raises some issues. Do we as a country, as a planet, really want to be reliant on private companies for our space exploration? Do we want a possible colony on Mars to be a privately held branch of Musk Industries? There are only a gazillion questions that are raised by the privatization of space. What’s good for the bottom line at SpaceX may or may not be good for humanity. We have certainly seen how a reliance on the inherent civic-mindedness and good will of corporations has worked on this planet. Musk is a dreamer, for sure, and I expect his dream of making a better world through the use of renewable energy and his hopes of establishing a human outpost on Mars are pure ideals. But the devil is always in the details, and what would happen should Musk be infected by another virulent strain of malaria and not escape with a near miss, as he did in 2001? Would the replacement CEO share his ideals? Would a replacement CEO be willing to take big risks to support those ideals? Would a replacement CEO look to sell Tesla off to GM to make a few quick billion? One person can move the world, but it takes more than a start to keep things rolling. We could certainly use plenty more people with the sort of drive and ambition that Elon Musk embodies. Innovation is a rare resource and must be cherished. But like any powerful force, it must be, if not tethered, at least monitored, to make certain that it does not run amok. Ashlee Vance has done an amazing job of telling not only Musk’s story, but of making the life history of the several companies with which Musk has been involved fascinating reading. I did get the sense that Vance was, from all the time he spent with Musk, smitten with his subject. While his portrait of Musk is hardly a zit-free one, I got the feeling that there might be a few more skeletons safely tucked away in closets, a few more bodies buried in basements. Nevertheless, Elon Musk is a powerful, entertaining and informative look at one of the most important people of our time. Your personal vision of the future should certainly include checking out this book.Review first posted - August 2015=================EXTRA STUFF has been moved to comment #1",5.0
324,Educated,,4.47,"['February', '20,', '2018']","On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.
Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times
We had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene’s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.
…he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss.

From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it.

325,"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption",,4.38,"['November', '16,', '2010']","I was cleaning up after the wife and I had dinner last night and there was a small amount of green beans left. There weren’t nearly enough for another serving to make them worth saving so I dumped them in the sink, but just as I was about to turn on the garbage disposal, I realized that to the POWs described in Unbroken those few green beans I was about to mulch would have been a feast they would have risked torture and beatings for. I was disgusted with myself for the rest of the night. You know the book you’re reading is hitting you hard when you feel that much shame for letting a tiny bit of food go to waste.Louie Zamperini is one of those guys who definitely earned that Greatest Generation label. The son of Italian immigrant parents, Louie was a rebellious kid who was constantly into one form of mischief or another, but when he finally channeled his energy into running, he became a high school track star in California. Louie was so good that he made the 1936 Olympics in Berlin at the age of 19, and even though he didn’t medal, he ran one lap of a race so quickly that he electrified the crowd and even caught Hitler’s attention.As a college runner, Louie held several national records and many thought that he’d be the man to eventually break the four minute mile. He was poised to do well in the 1940 Olympics, but then World War II cancelled the games. Louie left college and ended up in the air corps even though he was scared of planes. He became a bombardier and went to the Pacific after Pearl Harbor. Louie survived several missions, including one where their B-24 barely made it back with over 500 holes in it.While on a search and rescue mission, Louie’s plane crashed in the ocean, and only he and two others survived. With few supplies on two tiny life rafts, they’d endure exposure, starvation, thirst and sharks. However, after finally reaching an island and being captured by the Japanese, Louie’s hellish experience as a POW would make him miss the raft and the sharks. Starved, beaten, tortured and degraded, Louie also faces extra punishment at the hands of a brutally sadistic guard who singled him out. Louie and the other prisoners desperately try to hang on long enough for America to win the war and free them.I didn’t care anything about race horses, but found Laura Hillenbrand’s Seabiscuit an incredibly interesting read. She’s surpassed that book here with this well researched story. Hillenbrand creates vivid descriptions of Louie’s childhood, the Berlin Olympics, the life of an air man in the Pacific, and a Japanese POW camp while also telling the stories of the people around Louie.She also does a superior job of describing a phase of World War II that tends to get overlooked, Japanese war crimes against prisoners. The number of prisoners killed by the Japanese through starvation, beatings and forced labor are staggering, but Hillenbrand also shines a light on the Japanese policy of killing all POWs if that area was about to be invaded. Per her research, they were preparing to begin slaughtering prisoners in Japan in late August and September of 1945, but the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the emperor probably saved those POWs lives. If the war would have carried on or a conventional invasion done, then mostly likely those prisoners would have been killed.**(Do not take this as my personal feelings about whether nuclear weapons should have been used or not. I’m just relaying a part of the book here, and Hillenbrand makes no argument as to whether dropping the bombs was justified. She writes that many of the POWs believed that the bombings probably saved their lives and leaves it at that. And if you feel like trying to start a comment fight about it, I’m just going to delete it so don’t bother. I left my sword and shield at home today and don’t feel like battling trolls.)Ultimately, while this is a book about people enduring incredible hardship and cruelty during war, it's a hopeful book, not a depressing one. Great writing and the care that Hillenbrand took with the people and places make this compelling reading.",4.0
326,Einstein: His Life and Universe,,4.16,"['April', '10,', '2007']","I decided to read this book primarily because of my fiance's interest in Einstein's life and theories. I thought it might help me to actually have a somewhat intelligent reply on the rare occasion he starts talking physics (don't tell him I said so, but he is much smarter than I am). :)I felt a bit daunted by the length of it at first (700 pages, or 22 hours on 18 CDs), but the book is engrossing from the start. The periodic and quite detailed descriptions of Einstein's theories and research were a bit (okay, maybe way) over my head at times, but that didn't in any way damper my enjoyment of the book. When I did understand the physics, I found it all rather fascinating. I especially enjoyed learning the details of Einstein's life, relationships, struggles and philosophies. In fact, much to my surprise, there were times I had trouble putting this book down. Isaacson creates a vivid and engaging portrait of who Einstein was as a whole -- both the brilliant and the quirky -- and gives us a wonderful glimpse into how this man's amazing mind led to some of the most incredible scientific discoveries in history. Very well-written and meticulously researched.",5.0
327,John Adams,,4.08,"['May', '1,', '2001']","MESSAGE TO BIOGRAPHERS: Tidy up your prose, sharpen your story-telling, knowledge up on your source material and bring your entire bag of game, because the gauntlet has been chucked, the bar has been raised and David McCullough has taken off his literary glove and pasted all of you upside your second rate heads. The challenge is before you. This is, WITHOUT QUESTION, the best biography I have ever read. It is also, again WITHOUT QUESTION, the best story on the American Revolution and the creation of the United States of America that I have ever read. The breadth, depth and detail of this biography is unbelievable. Epic does not begin in describe it. It is epic epicness on an epically epic scale. This is only appropriate given the subject matter. After finishing this book, I believe the John Adams is the ""founding father"" I most admire. By making that statement, I do not want to downgrade the importance of the others. Jefferson was arguably more intelligent and was clearly the better writer. Washington was the most beloved and admired figure and without his leadership, the fledgling country would not have had a much needed symbol to rally around and the revolution may very well have failed. Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, James Madison, Samuel Adams, John Jay and all the rest deserve to be acknowledged for their significant contributions. So why John Adams? Two simple but very important reasons. First, John Adams, through the beautiful prose of McCullough, came across to me as the quintessential HONORABLE MAN. True, he was short tempered and intellectually vain in so far as he very much desired to be acknowledged as ""great"" by his countrymen. He was a man with many faults. However, he NEVER allowed any of his shortcomings or personal desires to influence any decision he made or any action he took. He was a ROCK OF INTEGRITY and every action he took and decision he made (though not always correct in hindsight) was what he genuinely BELIEVED to be in the best interest of the country. Thus, he came across in this story as the person who most aptly illustrated the qualities of INTEGRITY, VIRTUE AND MORAL FORTITUDE. In contrast, Jefferson's ""behind the scenes"" attacks on Adams and his inability to even acknowledge the same later on struck me as shallow and less than admirable. I point that out not to bash Jefferson (who I also admire) but to demonstrate that even the best of men had moments when they did not act in accordance with their conscience. Everyone that is, except John Adams, who never seemed to waiver from the path his conscience set before him. The second reason, and one that goes hand in hand with the first, is the absolute devotion, respect and love that he and his wife, Abigail, displayed for one another throughout their lives. Call me sappy and overly sentimental, but I was absolutely awe struck by the level of commitment and affection that they felt and showed to one another even across great distances and during long years when they hardly even saw each other. John and Abigail drew strength and comfort from one another in a way that was special and unique. This just cemented for me the truly exceptional nature of John Adams' character. He made me proud to be an American and to have such men in my country's history. Anyway, to sum up, I loved this book and give it my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!! 6.0 Stars. One final note: for those of you that listen to audiobooks, I wanted to point out that I listened to the unabridged version (all 30+ hours of it) narrated by Nelson Runger and Mr. Runger did an amazing job that I believe added both to my enjoyment and absorption of the material.",5.0

329,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,,4.49,"['November', '15,', '2016']","I'd rate this 4.5 stars.I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart's successor on 
The Daily Show
. I inherently knew that they wouldn't pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart's, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he'd be able to tough it out and show the stuff—comedic and otherwise—of which he was made.After reading 
Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood
, I realize that I needn't have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media's eye, he'd have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!!""On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.""Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn't be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn't walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person's child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way.""She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.""
Born a Crime
 provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn't white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave.If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah's day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It's also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other.More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends).I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn't know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I've heard him deliver his lines on 
The Daily Show
. This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn't go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show—other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap.I've heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah's story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn't heavy-handed; it's fun, insightful, and very compelling.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo..., and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2016.html.",4.0
330,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,,4.12,"['February', '2,', '2010']","The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog.",4.0
331,Leonardo da Vinci,,4.20,"['October', '17,', '2017']","Shortly after Melinda and I got married, I told her I was bidding on a notebook that could wind up costing a lot of money. “Don’t you already have a great portable computer?” she asked.I explained that by “notebook,” I meant the old-fashioned kind. And by “old-fashioned,” I meant really old-fashioned, as in more than 500 years old. The notebook in question was one of the 32 surviving journals of Leonardo da Vinci.After I won the bid, I broke a longstanding tradition. I was supposed to change the name from Codex Hammer (the previous owner was the industrialist Armand Hammer) to Codex Gates, but I thought that sounded silly and I changed the name back to Codex Leicester, the name it held from 1719 until 1980.The Codex Leicester is not nearly as famous as artworks such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. And Dan Brown fans will be disappointed to know that it doesn’t contain codes protecting age-old secrets. But it’s a scientific treasure. In fact, there are insights, such as one about how blood flows through the heart, that were so far ahead of their time that researchers finally verified them only a few decades ago.Given my fascination with Leonardo, I was eager to read Leonardo da Vinci, Walter Isaacson’s new biography. I’ve read a lot about Leonardo over the years, but I had never found one book that satisfactorily covered all the different facets of his life and work. Walter—a talented journalist and author I’ve gotten to know over the years—did a great job pulling it all together. If you liked Walter’s major biographies of Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein, you’ll probably appreciate this one.More than any other Leonardo book I’ve read, this one helps you see him as a complete human being and understand just how special he was. He came close to understanding almost all of what was known on the planet at the time. That’s partly because scientific knowledge was relatively limited back then, partly because he had a high IQ, but mostly because he was insatiably curious about pretty much every area of natural science and the human experience. He studied, in meticulous detail, everything from the flow of water and the rise of smoke to the muscles you use when you smile.Amazingly, he did it with almost no formal schooling. His father was a notary, a profession that gave him some prominence and prosperity, so Leonardo never had to work in the fields. But because Leonardo was born out of wedlock (his mother was a poor, orphaned peasant girl), he was not sent off to school. That turned out to be a blessing. Leonardo got free time to wander, look at nature, and start creating notebooks full of observations and ideas. He became, in his own words, “a disciple of experience.”Isaacson also does a great job of explaining why Leonardo’s work is so revered. Unless you’re an art historian, you might even wonder if paintings like the Mona Lisa are famous just for being famous. But Walter shows how Leonardo’s genius is in the details. “He became fascinated about how a smile begins to form and instructed himself to analyze every possible movement of each part of the face and determine the origin of every nerve that controls each facial muscle,” he writes. “Tracing which of those nerves are cranial and which are spinal may not have been necessary for painting a smile, but Leonardo needed to know.”Despite his remarkable artistic talent, Leonardo barely thought of himself as a painter. When he was about 30 years old, he applied for a job with the ruler of Milan. After listing interests from military engineering to science to designing sets for plays, he included almost as an afterthought, “I can also paint.” There was one downside to having such broad interests: He often switched his focus to new domains right in the middle of a project, leaving works unfinished. Here’s a classic example: After Leonardo won a coveted commission to create a large statue of a nobleman perched on a horse, Leonardo procrastinated by going down multiple rabbit roles. For example, he dissected horses to understand their anatomy, created new systems for feeding horses, and designed cleaner stables. He never completed the statue, and he never published the treatise on horses he started.When you look across all of Leonardo’s many abilities and his few failings, the attribute that stands out above all else was his sense of wonder and curiosity. When he wanted to understand something—whether it was the flow of blood through the heart or the shape of a woodpecker’s tongue—he would observe it closely, scribble down his thoughts, and then try to figure it all out. It’s a bit of a lost art these days—even though, in the age of free Wikipedia entries and YouTube videos, it’s easier than ever to satisfy your curiosity. It’s ironic that we can be reminded about the wonders of modern life by a man who lived 500 years ago.",4.0
332,The Autobiography of Malcolm X,,4.36,"['October', '29,', '1965']","“I’ve had enough of someone else’s propaganda. I’m for truth, no matter who tells it. I’m for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I’m a human being first and foremost, and as such I’m for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.”  - Malcolm XIn High School my history syllabus covered just a few pages on African-American civil rights heroes. The majority of those pages were on Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X was barely mentioned. After reading this book I was perplexed! I wonder why Malcolm X hasn't been given the same respect as Dr. King; he contributed so much to the civil rights movement as well, yet my knowledge on this man was very minimal.How did Malcolm Little become Malcolm X aka El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz? This is what this book is all about. His transformation was remarkable especially as he spent time in foster homes and was a hustler in Detroit. He lived in an America where smart black kids were discouraged from being lawyers etc, and thus dropped out of school at young ages. It made me think for the umpteenth time just how can society malign and vilify black people, especially black men, when society itself is responsible for restricting them in the first place?Among the many things I admired about Malcolm X was his thirst for knowledge. He is a great advertisement for autodidactism and how effective and transformative self-education can be:  “I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there, in prison, that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive.” It was hard for me to read this book and not compare Malcolm X’s philosophy to Dr. King’s. I always thought I would adhere more closely to Dr. King’s peaceful, nonviolence philosophy, but after reading this book I do agree with Malcolm X’s ideology as well. Not that I am advocating violence, but radicalness and action is sometimes needed, as are anger and indignation. As Malcolm X said, ““So early in life, I learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise.” I feel there is so much to learn from both men so I won’t say I prefer one doctrine over another. At the same time I wonder, how can people not become militant and revolutionary after having experienced so much cruelty and discrimination?Another thing I found interesting in this autobiography was Malcolm X’s religious transformation; from having been raised Christian, to entering the Nation of Islam (NOI), he finally found his spiritual home in “mainstream” Islam. His depiction of his trip to Mecca in particular was very enlightening and a turning point in his life. His adoration of Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the NOI, was quite sad, especially as Muhammad seems to have been a bit of a weirdo. Muhammad said something along the lines of too-short women marrying tall men and vice versa is ridiculous. Also, he said that a man should ideally marry a woman half his age plus 7 years. Malcolm is unapologetic about his views in this book and that's what I love best about this autobiography. His writing is very candid and so informative. This is an important book for all to read. The prevalence of eurocentrism in the world is astounding and I don’t think we really realize just how established it is. Malcolm X dissected the race problem so well, I felt inspired.",5.0
333,Into the Wild,"Krakauer’s page-turning bestseller explores a famed missing person mystery while unraveling the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.""Terrifying... Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning."" —New York Times",4.01,"['January', '13,', '1996']","My grandfather--not an Alaskan but an experienced outdoorsman--would have tied this kid to a tree and let the bears play tetherball with him.A small part of me appreciates the effort Krakauer put into researching this book. A much bigger part of me is completely disgusted both with McCandless himself and with Krakauer's mindless adoration of him. Krakauer pulls out all the stops to make McCandless look like a phenomenon, and seems to agree with McCandless that the world should have handed itself to him on a silver salver because he was just so darned special. We're told he was brilliant, independent, funny, kind, musical, athletic, visionary, talented. Can you see the halo? Unfortunately, the impression that comes across is of a snotty adolescent who has never seriously thought of anyone but himself and is used to getting by on charm and flippancy rather than making good use of his considerable gifts (and I do not doubt that he was gifted). The conflicting aspects of his personality don't sound quirky; they sound devious and self-serving.Krakauer tries half-heartedly to disguise his fascination but his admissions that McCandless was a clueless young hothead sound insincere; he has to say it to sound credible to his readers, who are less smitten. Krakauer makes an apt comparison between himself as an idealistic and foolhardy young man, and McCandless, and then dismisses himself because ""he didn't have [McCandless':] intellect"". This sounds utterly bogus after all we have been told about McCandless' foolish mistakes, and the obvious fact that Krakauer is not stupid. Two chapters that could have provided some insight into his hero are wasted because Krakauer sounds like a religious fanatic, with McCandless as his unknowable God and Krakauer as the I'm-not-worthy follower.McCandless' (and Everett Ruess') overconfidence speaks to a fascination with nature but not a respect for it. Courage is not the same as not knowing when we ought to have a healthy degree of fear. Instead, McCandless arrogantly drives his car into the habitat of an endangered species of poppy. He butchers a moose, wasting the life of a beautiful and well-adapted animal because he could not be bothered to learn ahead of time how to preserve it.This was not a tragedy; this was inevitable. I don't believe he was schizophrenic or suicidal. Bipolar or ADD, maybe. His own friends readily admitted that he had a lot of enthusiasm but little common sense and didn't know much outside of academia. There are so many glaring outdoorsmanship errors made in the first two chapter that even I was cringing.I write this with full admission that I am not much of an outdoorsperson. However, I don't believe for a minute that he lasted longer than most of us would have, or that ""at least he tried it"", as so many of his fans insist. I wouldn't try it, not because I'm scared, but because I can tell from here that ten pounds of rice and no preparation is a recipe for failure. I don't need to try it, and if I did, I'd want to live to get something out of it. Lots of other people have gone into the wilderness and come out just fine because they knew the magnitude of their own insignificance and planned ahead.I'm not jealous of his alleged brilliance, either. I was accepted to Emory. And the University of Chicago. And a couple of other amply respected schools. Lots of people are. Big deal.1) His bourgeois status made his adventure possible in the first place. He had money to pay his college tuition; the rest of us graduated and went to work to pay off our loans. He also had the gall to complain about his parents' offers to help him out, which smacks of a kid given so much that he doesn't know how fortunate he is.Furthermore, living with nothing by choice is very different from living with nothing because you have no alternative. Though I'm sure he would have denied it, McCandless had the option of going back to his affluent life if he had wanted to, or if he had had to in an emergency. Maybe it would have knocked his self-image for a loop, but he would have been sheltered, fed, and nursed back to health. A lot of people live in poverty without that safety net. 2) Now is not the time to be squeamish about killing animals. Hint: There are no vegetarian Aleut. This guy was a history and anthropology major. I learned in anthro that you can eat plants and lean protein until you burst and still starve to death if you aren't getting enough calories. It's very difficult to feed yourself if you're alone and don't have a lot of practice at it.3) If he got this idea from Thoreau and London, he wasn't reading very carefully. McCandless should have read less Thoreau and more Donner Party. London's Alaskan experience was during the Klondike Gold Rush when he had plenty of help from others. Thoreau lived in a cabin on the edge of town, a mile and a half from the family home. He was not in the wilderness. Furthermore, Thoreau's civil disobedience was a protest against the Mexican War and slavery, not a petty defiance of matters of public safety such as mandatory car insurance. McCandless was a rebel without a cause.4) Book-smart can't save you now. Success-only learning does not work. Krakauer goes into raptures about McCandless' education and intelligence to demonstrate the supposed tragedy of his loss. Nice brain gymnastics, but apples to oranges when what you need is practical knowledge.This guy was idolized by some my college classmates, most of whom were sheltered, relatively wealthy urbanites. They had the same vague and pathetic need for ""real"" experiences and arrogant expectation of success that comes from never having failed at anything in their lives.5) For most of his trip, McCandless was neither independent or self-reliant. He got lost in Mexico; it would have been more self-reliant to get a map and take charge of his own navigation. He didn't eat for days until somebody felt sorry for him and fed him. Once he was in a situation where there was nobody to step in for him, he died (in this respect, I disagree with Krakauer that McCandless was any different from Carl McCunn). Even at that point, he left a note on the door of the bus begging for rescue.The best (and most independent) outdoorsmen spend years learning. Just because you were a superstar student and athlete doesn't mean you get to skip all the hard work. I've no doubt that McCandless was smart, but he was mind-bogglingly ignorant and inexperienced.6) Why are these self-discovery escapades always so self-centered? How about joining the Peace Corps? Teaching in inner-city schools? Working in healthcare in a remote South Asian village? If you're so disgusted with society, why don't you do something to improve it rather than keeping all the enlightenment for yourself?7) Nature is not your babysitter. Nature doesn't care if you live or die. It's survival of the fittest, and humans, compared to most animals, are slow, weak, poorly-armed, poorly-insulated, have no stamina; have poor senses of smell, eyesight, and hearing; and are ill-adapted to go without clean water and food for any length of time. We are clearly meant to live in groups and use tools. This guy didn't even bring an ax.8) He was already controlled and tainted by society or else he would not have worked so hard to avoid it. His anti-society and anti-materialism were as controlling of him as is the materialism of those who think they can ""find themselves"" by buying the right clothes or drug habit or SUV.9) Unprepared people who set out on ill-planned ""adventures"" and need to be rescued are jackasses. A lot of other people–-better-prepared, better-trained, and more sensible people such as park service, volunteers, and EMT's–-end up spending a lot of time and money, and risking their own necks, to save them. McCandless spared everyone that trouble, but I'm sure there's a whole line of wannabes lined up to try it. I hope they have to pay back every penny spent on their rescues.And Truth? The bad news is that Truth is relative. It doesn't exist in a vacuum. What a waste.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",2.0
334,Bossypants,,3.96,"['April', '5,', '2011']","Tina Fey's Bossypants was a disappointment. I don't know that expecting much from a comedy writer's cash-in big-font-with-pictures essay/memoir...thing...is fair, but I've been a Tina Fey fan since 30 Rock began, ready to trust her literary aspirations, and even to me this book barely scratches onto the two star plateau.What did I expect? Well, it's probably easier to explain what I didn't expect. I wasn't counting on a sour, muddled, defensive screed against anyone who pissed off the author in the last thirty years. I wasn't hoping for forced, obvious stories about the professional discrimination in Fey's history. I wasn't looking forward to insecure ramblings about the long hours she put into Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock. And I definitely wasn't expecting all of the above to be sugarcoated by a combination of weak, insecure meta-analysis and self-conscious “oh, I'm really not that great” coverups. You know why Bossypants bugged me? Tina Fey has nothing for which to apologize. She's smart, she's funny, and she's talented. So I assume this book had some sort of cathartic impact and she needed to get this bile out of her system. Bossypants gets credit for three short, quality sections. First, Fey tackles the “what's that scar on your face?” question right up front and follows with some funny, interesting commentary on how she can gauge people by how they respond to the scar. Second, she answers a few critical emails/blog comments as a “question and answer” chapter. Third, she walks the reader through a detailed analysis of the whole “I look like Sarah Palin” era. I read this book quickly, over two nights, and while Bossypants is well-written, for the most part, the subject matter's dour nature left me cold, oh, 75% of the time.Listen. I didn't pick this book up whispering, under my breath, “Make me laugh right NOW, Tina Fey! Dance, monkey, dance!” But I feel like Tina Fey wrote this book for 1) young women she's trying to inspire, and 2) all the people who hate her who will never read this book, anyway. Maybe 41 year old white guys weren't her target audience. I can live with that. I'll still watch 30 Rock, though, and not just because she's hot. I just hope next time Fey writes a better book.",2.0
335,James,,4.61,"['March', '19,', '2024']","Whoa, that was so not was I was expecting. Despite the Goodreads blurb that calls this book “ferociously funny” and “brimming with electrifying humor,” I didn't really find much to laugh about while reading it. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was just surprised by how serious and thought-provoking this novel ended up being. I mean, sure, there are a few funny bits here and there, but I definitely wouldn't consider this to be a humorous book overall.But, with that said, James is a brilliant piece of fiction and I have once again been wowed by Percival Everett's talent. (As an aside, if you want to read a truly funny book by Everett, grab yourself a copy of The Trees. It's amazing.) Everett manages to stay true to the tone and style of 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
 while at the same time creating something completely different with runaway slave Jim as the narrator.This is not an easy book to read … well, subject-wise, anyway. Lots of terrible things happen to good people, mostly just because of the color of their skin. There are awful characters who degrade and take advantage of Jim just because they can. There is murder and rape and violence and death. I've read books about slavery before, but somehow this one brought home the inhumanity of it like no other. I foresee lots of challenges to this book by the “slavery wasn't really all that bad,” red hat-wearing, book-burning crowd.I flew through this book and found it basically unputdownable. I read the first 80% in one sitting, forced myself to go to bed around 3 a.m., and then finished the last bit first thing the next morning. It's exciting and suspenseful and heart-wrenching all at the same time, and the ending was fantastic.If you enjoyed the original Huck Finn, you'll probably love this version at least as much, if not more. Percival Everett is an incredibly talented author and a national treasure, and this latest book of his deserves all of the praise and recognition that will undoubtedly come its way.Many thanks to NetGalley and Doubleday for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review.",5.0
336,The Great Divide,,3.74,"['March', '5,', '2024']","I love stories that take me to foreign countries where I’m able to become immersed in different cultures.Panama is one such country.The history of the canal is fascinating. How America stormed in and offered Columbia $$ to give Panama its independence. It wasn’t a selfless gesture, however, America wanted a canal for their own economic needs.This is a story of those who came to help build, resist the build and those to reclaim what was rightfully theirs. There are those who travelled from across the country and from across the sea.As much as I loved the intent of this story and the characters, it fell short for me. Henriquez created such marvellous characters yet, she failed on developing any of them through. We have a young Ada who travelled from Barbados to get a job to pay for her sister’s surgery; Omar who was looking more from his life, takes a job working in the canal that mutes his father speechless as he is shamed by it; Valentina ready to lead the town to protest the dam required for the canal; and so many other fascinating characters.The story did merge beautifully yet I was still left wanting: More of some characters, less of others; more of the impacts of the canal.Overall a solid 4⭐️",4.0

The Underground Library
 features three women in London during World War II when London was bombed and air raid sirens sounded nightly.Juliet Lansdown is the new deputy librarian at the Bethnal Green Library. However, it isn’t busy and she is determined to invigorate it despite a head librarian who doesn’t want change. Katie Upwood has been working at the same library until she starts at the university in the fall. Her family life is filled with conflict, she has a secret, and her boyfriend died in the war. Sofie Baumann is a refugee from Berlin who received a visa by going into domestic service to a hateful and disparaging widower. She’s concerned about her father and sister left behind in Berlin. Will they get visas? Her one relief from it all are her visits to the library and friendship she finds there.When the library is destroyed by bombs, Juliet manages to relocate the books to the local Underground station where residents take shelter each night. However, tragedy seems to follow them. Will the library be saved? Will Juliet, Katie, and Sofie get their happily ever afters?Juliet has oppressive parents who she is happy to leave behind in Upper Beeding. She’s smart, needs a challenge, bookish, energetic, empathetic, and has a lot of ideas. Katie is smart, lives at home with her parents and brothers, and has a secret. Sofie uses books to escape terrible times. She is worried about her family in Berlin and is treated horribly by her employer. The characterization is the main and supporting characters is excellent.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel. The characters were likeable and the focus was on women, the roles others wanted for them, what the women wanted for themselves, and the challenges they faced in achieving them. Other themes included friendship, family, life choices, wartime danger, community, found family, sacrifice, volunteerism, treatment of others, the power of books, hope, and romance.Overall, I learned a lot about these women who had a vision and pursued it relentlessly as well as about the library itself and the internment camps on the Isle of Man. The excellent characterization made this book special. The author did significant research and I recommend reading her note after completing the novel.Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine, Ballantine Books and Jennifer Ryan provided a digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

339,Becoming Madam Secretary,"She took on titans, battled generals, and changed the world as we know it…New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Dray returns with a captivating and dramatic new novel about an American heroine Frances Perkins.",4.49,"['March', '12,', '2024']","**Many thanks to Berkley and Stephanie Dray for an ARC of this book provided via NetGalley!**""Being a woman has only bothered me in climbing trees."" - Frances PerkinsIt is this frank and fearless nature that sets Frances Perkins apart...and from the moment she arrives in New York City, destined to bring about change, she truly has her work cut out for her. Working with some of the poorest in Hell's Kitchen's tenements, it is apparent that working conditions (and living conditions) are not sustainable for the people of her fair city. She has several compatriots, each with a fire for revolution in their bellies: there's Upton Sinclair, a cheeky young fire-haired writer who longs to be more than just friends with Frances, a wealthy but kind socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, and a brooding, sensitive young reformer Paul Wilson, each determined to change the landscape in their own way. But after witnessing the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire firsthand (with workers literally LEAPING out of the burning building to the ground below), Frances knows that labor conditions need change: immediate and DRASTIC change. Though she isn't directly involved in politics herself, Frances gets word that Franklin ""Feather Duster"" Roosevelt, a rich and haughty man she encountered at a party once (who wasn't exactly her number one fan, to put it mildly!) is running for office...and he might actually WIN. Roosevelt has a plan that will take him up through the ranks, and quickly: a plan that will end with him in the White House. When all of this comes to pass, NO one is more surprised than Frances when FDR not only recognizes Frances' passion for reform and labor policy, but wants to appoint her to be his Secretary of Labor...making her the very FIRST woman in the presidential cabinet.Although Frances is honored and perhaps more passionate and driven by her work than anyone around her, she is met with push-back and criticism over and over again. Many men assume she can't do her job AND be a wife and mother...but Frances isn't going to let anything stand in her way. But balancing the severe troubles experienced by members of her family...acting as an indomitable force during FDR's tenure...AND fighting for social security and labor reform proves to be nearly overwhelming for Frances, and she starts to wonder if she can TRULY make all of these dreams come true. Will her bold determination start a blaze of glory that will continue on for generations to come...or will everything she has worked for crumble before her very eyes?I'm a bit ashamed to say that before picking up this book, I probably hadn't heard the name Frances Perkins since elementary school...and since this may have been back in the 2nd or 3rd grade I couldn't have told you a THING about her. After reading this book, it's not only shocking but saddening to me that such an integral part of history was not a MAJOR focus in the curriculum. As someone who is very passionate when it comes to workers' rights (and as a former Union member myself, when I had the opportunity to be in one!) it was easy for me to become VERY invested in Frances' mission as she fought to keep children out of factories, to enforce more limited working hours (No more fourteen hour days...and we think we have it bad now! ) and to establish programs like social security which would benefit ALL citizens, not just those born into wealth. Sadly, many of these fights persist today, but they would have been Dead on Arrival PERMANENTLY if not for the tireless work of Frances Perkins. To say this book is enlightening is an understatement: I feel I owe Frances a debt of gratitude!Dray also does something special with this narrative: this is technically historical fiction, but almost reads more like a diary or a memoir. Perkins takes you through so many years of her life, but the chapters are fairly short and manageable, and there is a solid balance between Perkins' work life and her personal life. There is romance and heartache, inner turmoil and also an exploration of the power of friendship. While Perkins and FDR have a rocky start, the two learn to work in tandem in a truly powerful way, and like all of the relationships explored here, has a complexity and a beauty all its own. Perkins' choices are never easy, and this is the recurring theme underlying her entire career. Being a woman during this time was hard enough in and of itself, but to make some of the 'radical' statements and decisions Perkins was forced to make at times was what set her apart...and I am SO thrilled Dray chose to share this history in such an interesting way.This book is also 500+ pages (!) which is usually somewhat of a red flag for me when it comes to historical fiction, but this one is written in such a way that it never feels overly long or complex. The chapters move along at a pretty good clip, and as a reader I felt that the only reason the book was this length was to make sure she captured as much detail about Perkins' life as possible: this one is meticulously researched, with Dray highlighting at the end any areas where she took creative liberty, but these are few and far between. There's always a stark difference between authors who TRULY do their research in historical fiction and those that rely on more 'basic' tropes and commonly known information. I applaud Dray's dedication to preserving the integrity of Frances Perkins and EVERYTHING she accomplished during her truly impactful time in office.And through Dray, by the end of her journey, Perkins makes an observation true of so many bold and brilliant, brave and breathtaking revolutionaries of the past, present, and future: ""So maybe a spark of madness is what it takes to accomplish anything truly revolutionary in this world.""One tiny, seemingly insignificant, but POWERFUL spark! 🔥 💪4 stars",4.0

I received a copy of If the Tide Turns by Rachel Rueckert from Kensington Publishing and Edelweiss Plus in exchange for an honest review. The well written debut novel is told from the points of view of Maria and Sam and inspired by a real-life pirate Sam Bellamy. The reader's given an idea of what piracy was really like in the early 1700's, life in Colonial America, use of herbal medicine, banishment of women, evils of slavery and the plight of the Native American Wampanoag people.

341,The Divorcées,,3.27,"['March', '19,', '2024']","3.5 stars:I was unaware of the divorce -ranch phenomenon in the midcentury USA. I had always heard of people going to Nevada to get a quick divorces, but I was young, not curious/interested about divorce machinations. In “The Divorcees”, author Rowan Beaird informs the reader, early on, that Nevada passed a law to allow divorces, with the stipulation that you become a Nevada citizen. For the divorce to occur, one member must reside in Nevada for six weeks; one must provide proof that they were there for the entire six weeks. It was explained that, after the Depression, it was gambling and divorces that brought financial health back to Nevada. Thus, divorce “ranches” were created by industrious citizens, whereby a person can stay at said estate for the 6 weeks required for residency and divorce. It was women who went to these ranches, generally paid for by their parents or family money. Enter naïve Lois Gorski Saunders, from Lake Forest IL. Lois is an awkward woman, not comfortable in her own skin. Her mother told her the only way to freedom for a woman was to marry. The 1950’s weren’t necessarily a kind time for women. Lois’s mother died when she was young, and her mother was not a happily married wife. Both mother and daughter are written as “different”. Neither mother nor daughter understood nor tolerated the social conventions expected of women. So, Lois marries the first man who asks because she thought that was what she was to do. Obviously, we know that she decided to divorce her husband, as the book opens with Lois at the ranch.Through backstories, we learn of Lois’s marriage and her life prior to being married. The reader aches for Lois. Once she’s at the ranch, which was funded and chosen by her father, she feels like she’s back in “mean girl” territory. Her father chose a ranch for “respectable” women. It’s like her married life all over again: women judging her based on her clothing, where she went to school, who her people are. Lois does not feel comfortable. And then a new, unexpected, resident, Greer Lang joins the group. Greer is mysterious; she’s confident. Plus, Greer is sporting a bruise on her face which leads the other ranch ladies to make assumptions that her man did this to her. This is a true period piece. There is abundant smoking, drinking (an amazing amount of drinking), and of course, gambling. Author Rowan Beaird writes of the time when women had little or no agency over their lives. Greer seems to rise above it all, not caring about social conventions, which Lois has always wanted to have the deportment to do. Greer wears men’s trousers, ala Katherine Hepburn. She has moxie and chutzpa which Lois finds attractive. These are traits that Lois wants.The reader understands where this is leading. We await Lois to catch-up. I was spellbound by Beaird’s narrative. She captured the period well. This is a slow burn drama that left this reader sad.",3.0
342,The Girls We Sent Away,"“[A]n important and vital story. With exquisite writing, Church exposes a murky little pocket of history, and a reprehensible practice that surely had a generational impact on families.” —Donna Everhart, USA Today bestselling and award-winning author of The Saints of Swallow Hill",4.03,"['March', '5,', '2024']","4.25⭐️Set in 1960s North Carolina, this story revolves around seventeen-year-old Lorraine Delford. An only child of dutiful parents who take pride in her accomplishments, Lorraine has a good life at home, is top of her class and has ambitions beyond being a wife and mother as is traditionally expected of women. When an unplanned pregnancy threatens to change everything for her, Lorraine is resilient and makes an effort to accept how her life will change, but her boyfriend abandons her and her parents offer no support instead sending her away to a maternity home for unwed mothers to hide their shame and protect their reputation in their community. Hoping that she would be able to continue her education while there, she is shocked to see the indifferent, uncaring attitude of the housemother and doctors in whose care she has been entrusted realizing that she is expected to return to her former life after she gives birth and gives up her child. She meets others- both like and unlike herself - a reality check that compels her to take stock of her life and reflect on her priorities, the difficult choices she needs to make and the choices that have been made for her fully aware that her life will never be the same even though she is expected to go on as if this episode in her life never happened.""Strength isn't in the loud and obvious. Strength is often camouflaged in the quiet, reserved places where most people wouldn't think to look. It's grown in the moments when we give up things along the way.""The Girls We Sent Away by Meagan Church is an incredibly moving story. Beautifully written, heart wrenching yet thought-provoking, this novel captures the social landscape of the Baby Scoop Era and the plight of unwed young girls who were forced to succumb to familial and societal pressure to relinquish their rights to their children. Lorraine’s journey is a painful one as she evolves from a sheltered young girl to a young mother forced to face the reality of her situation and the society in which she lives. It was heartbreaking to witness the challenges faced by these young girls, alone with no guidance or emotional support, their choices taken away from them and let down by everyone they should have been able to trust. The author is brutally honest in her depiction of the psychological toll of her experiences and the emotional scars she carries into her adulthood. Granted those were different times, but it is sad to read stories about women who are judged for mistakes for which they alone were not responsible and how easy it was for society, community and their families to shame them into submission. The author has presented us with a powerful story that will stay with you long after you have finished reading this book.Do read The Author's Note, where she discusses her inspiration for this story. This was my first time reading this author and I'm eager to explore more of her work.I paired my reading with audio narration by Susan Bennett, who breathes life into the characters and this story, for an absorbing immersion reading experience. ""Sometimes surviving means finding the strength to pick up the remnants of shattered dreams and piece together a mosaic of new ones, a continual work in progress, a constant decision to put one foot in front of the other, to fight against gravity, and keep moving forward.""Many thanks to SOURCEBOOKS Landmark for the digital review copy and RB Media for the ALC via NetGalley.

After 8 books, I was surprised to find myself swooning over Speedwell and Stoker in a fresh, new way. Tender and tenacious. Veronica Speedwell is my favorite kind of character: smart, quick-tongued, vivacious, and loyal. She knows who she is and won't sacrifice that based on anyone's expectations.

in this sequel, Ruthless Vows seamlessly picks up where it’s predecessor left off. this story thrusts readers back into the enchanting world of Oath, where unruly magic, war and sleeping gods collide. two weeks have passed since iris winnow reluctantly returned home from the war front with her brother forest. she now grapples with the deceptive calm that envelops her hometown and iris battles with not knowing if roman has survived the bombing. i was going to rate this 3 stars but something happened at the end that made it lose .5 of a star. that really hurt my feelings, why would you do that 😭😭damn, these new anticipated releases have not been it at ALL. idk if authors are trying way too hard to live up to their success or we just have high expectations but these releases have not been hitting whatsoever. you all don’t understand how sad it makes me to even rate it this but i just did not enjoy this book whatsoever. nothing felt captivating, it was underwhelming, there was no plot and this book just couldn’t keep my attention. whilst i was desperate for the continuation of roman and iris’ story i cant help but feel so dissatisfied with this conclusion. i was completely blown away by how romantic, emotional and intimate DR was. i was craving that same feeling again when i picked up ruthless vows. i really just wanted this book to explore more on iris and roman’s love story and their marriage. although their story continues, it feels like they are not the main characters anymore. their chapters fell flat for me, and their conversations were odd and out of place since they were apart for majority of the book, which for the life of me i cannot comprehend why that were apart for 95% of the book. there were so many times were i would pick up my kindle, read one to two chapters, put my kindle back down then pick it back up 1-2 days later.. like that’s how bored i was with this story, it was actually a mission for me to finish this. i was contemplating dnfing so many times but i hate to dnf books. i was waiting for this to get better and it didn’t lmao. i hate when authors throw in the amnesia trope bc the whole connection and the build-up between the characters is erased and then they have to find their way back to each other again. ahhh i just wanted more cheesy, cutesy, lovey-dovey romaniris moments!!

""the problem is... i want to hear from you at all hours. i want to read your words. i am greedy for them. i am hungry for them.""

the first half was honestly just a recap of divine rivals, but with different circumstances. i hate how romaniris were apart, it was for way too long for my liking!! i was missing the connection to the characters, the stolen glances, the little touches, the tension and pining. i wish there were more beautiful letters, that’s what made divine rivals so enchanting. i absolutely adored all of the tender moments between roman and iris in the first book, but there was barely any romance in this book which is so disappointing (apart from chapter 35, that chapter was so tender and will be next fixation aaa my heart!!!) the first book built it up perfectly to continue it on for this story. like i hated how they got married so quickly so i really thought it was going to be explored and how they will adapt to marriage after they are reunited but there was absolutely no depth to their characters. it seems that the author doesn’t know how balance and differentiate between the romance and fantasy plot. since divine rivals was lacking fantasy, ruthless vows was lacking romance. i know we asked for more world-building and more on the gods but please we didn’t mean take the focus off of romaniris 😩 the war between the gods felt so sloppy to me, so really you did this for what?? nothing 😭 dacre has no personality beyond being entitled, controlling, mind-numblingly stupid and an actual joke. are you seriously expecting me to take him as a villain when he didn’t even feel threatening.. idk why but i just kept picturing him as dr. evil from austin powers. for a god with big plans why was he so trusting towards roman?? it didn’t make sense to me, he literally told roman all of his plans.. like sir, are you dumb or stupid?? he was practically the main character in this book and it took all of the focus off of romaniris. also enva felt like a background character and a puppet master. idk what the point of her character was bc she just pops up out of no where at the end to save the day. i also think the author was trying to do too much and therefore none of it was executed perfectly. introducing the ‘graveyard’ felt unnecessary bc they had no important relevance to this story whatsoever. the tone of changes between chapters was so ??? in one chapter you have a god causing massive destruction and you will feel the urgency and think “omg what is dacre going to do now?” but then in the next chapter you will have the characters at a cafe drinking tea and eating scones or attending family dinners like there isn’t a war occuring. why give me a rush and make me feel super anxious only for it to be ruined..this story fell flat for me, i just didn’t feel that spark like i did with divine rivals. i will always applaud rebecca ross for her beautiful writing and her lyrical prose. although this book wasn’t enjoyable for me, romaniris will always have a special place in my heart. i’m keeping them in my pocket forever 🥹

let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust.

346,The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue,,4.19,"['October', '6,', '2020']","ARC provided by Tor in exchange for an honest review. 


""Stories come in so many forms: in charcoal, and in song, in paintings, poems, films. And books.""



This is a book about a girl, a boy, a devil, and the stories that get told and repeated and remembered. This is a tale of power dynamics and imbalances and what humans are willing to do to not feel trapped and alone. This is all about a young girl who lives her life for herself, who lives her life in spite of the odds, who lives her life in hopes someone will recall her from memory.Everything about Addie LaRue completely blew me away. This is the first book by V.E. Schwab that I’ve given five stars to, and I’m not sure a day has passed since reading that I haven’t thought about it. I will say that I think this book (and more importantly the ending) could be a bit polarizing, but this story, this main character, and the way everything was structured just really worked perfectly for me and my reading tastes.How do I even begin to describe this book to you? There are truly so many layers woven together to make this story. Many of you know, this is something that V.E. Schwab has been working on for a decade and you can tell they really put their whole heart and soul into these complex characters:➽ Addie - A girl with seven freckles, and she is told that there is one for every love she would ever have. She was born in a small town, and had small town expectations placed on her, but Addie had big dreams and desired to see as much of the world as she possibly could. And when she turns twenty-three, and everyone thinks her time is slowly running out, she quickly finds out that time is something she will never have to fear again.


""Spells are for the witches, and witches are too often burned.""


➽ Henry - Works at a bookstore in New York while trying to live his life to the fullest. And he happens to be able to see a girl that has never been remembered before.


""I remember you.""


➽ Luc - A god you should never pray to after dark, unless you are very desperate, and feel very helpless, and are willing to pay the unknown price.


""I am stronger than your god and older than your devil. I am the darkness between stars, and the roots beneath the earth. I am promise, and potential, and when it comes to playing games, I divine the rules, I set the pieces, and I choose when to play. And tonight, I say no.""


And maybe, just maybe, Addie felt like she should be able to pay the price when she runs into the forest one night, willing to risk everything to have a life that is hers once and for all. We get to see Addie and her struggles and her growth over the course of three-hundred-years, starting in 1714 France and switching to 2014 America. We get to see so much of Addie’s hurt throughout the centuries, but we also get to see so much of her yearning. Yearning for love, yearning for knowledge, yearning for art, yearning for a life that is worthy of remembrance. Truly, this book was able to evoke such visceral reactions from me, and I could truly feel Addie’s yearning, and her hurt, on every page.Now that I have used the word “yearning” one-hundred times, let’s talk about some of the rep in Addie LaRue, because there are lots of queer characters and characters who read queer! Addie is pan or bi, and we get to see her in relationships with different genders throughout this book, but the main relationship (and yearning) is m/f. I believe Henry is pan, but it is never said on page, but ""he’s attracted to a person first and their gender second"" had me and my pan heart ascending to new heights, I promise you that. Addie and Henry are both white, but there are POC side characters and other identities on the LGBTQIAP+ spectrum (gay, lesbian, maybe some polyamorous hints)! And this book, has some very serious depression representation!


""It’s just a storm, he tells himself, but he is tired of looking for shelter. It is just a storm, but there is always another waiting in its wake.""


Being unsure what you want in life. Especially in your twenties. Feeling like something is wrong with you. Feeling like you’ll never be enough. Feeling like you’ll never be whole. Feeling like you are just disappointing everyone around you. Feeling like no one will ever take the time to see you, the real you, and choose to love you unconditionally anyways. Whew, it’s a lot, and V.E. Schwab really didn’t hold back while writing Henry and his mental health. I don’t want to make this too personal, but it means a lot to me, and I know Henry’s journey is going to mean a lot to so many people and impact a lot of lives.(Also, friendly reminder that life is truly a vast range of up and down journeys! And you, and your journey, are valid, and I see you no matter how hard that journey feels at times. There will be lots of heavy days, but lots of light days too, I promise. And you are so worthy of love, and kindness, and respect, no matter where you are at on your journey. And feeling too much is not a curse, ever. And I’m proud of you, and you are never alone with what you are feeling, and sometimes we all need help with some storms: http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org)


""His heart has a draft. It lets in light. It lets in storms. It lets in everything.""


Plus, a key component of this story is the god who Addie makes a deal with. Addie and Luc’s three-hundred-year bargain is so very messy and has so very many different elements. But the key element is the unhealthy power dynamic. Over this course of time, we get to see their relationship change, and morph, and grow, and we get to see Addie desperately trying to gain some of the power for herself. But, it is a very unhealthy cycle of abuse and this story is told in a way where the reader gets to see these power imbalances come more and more into play and Luc and Addie set the stage of their game(s) more and more. I’ll be the first to say I always wanted more of Luc, and I loved every chapter he was in, and I constantly wanted to know more about him, but I will also say that I personally feel like V.E. Schwab was very deliberate with his character and with making him charming and intriguing and a character to be romanticized, because abusers can have all of those characteristics and still be abusers.But we get to see Luc, and Henry, and Addie, and watch their intertangled stories unwind. I truly feel like I can’t say much more about the actual story, and I believe it’s probably best to not know much more than what I’ve said above, but seeing these characters, during all their different phases in life, both alone and together, is truly something like a work of art.


""Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.""


This entire story truly is a love letter to art and the beautiful, awe inspiring, mind-blowing way stories are held within art, therefore held in so many hearts forever. Maybe even creating and inspiring other art, to make the sweetest ripple effect of them all. Art and stories are so powerful because they have the power to heal wounds that are too deep to be touched by other things. From feeling love, to feeling not alone, to inspiring, to escape, to be thought provoking, to be educational, to make you realize things you have been forced to internalize and unlearn, to something as simple yet as hard as happiness.


""Because time is cruel to all, and crueler still to artists. Because vision weakens, and voices wither, and talent fades. "" He leans close, twists a lock of her hair around one finger. ""Because happiness is brief, and history is lasting, and in the end, "" he says, ""everyone wants to be remembered.""


While I was reading this book, me and my best friend Lea watched a video that was reuploaded on V.E.’s YouTube. It was basically just an hour-long discussion that they had with Tessa Gratton, where they talk about many things, but one of the things they talked about that I especially haven’t been able to stop thinking about since finishing this book was that we never get to really pick what work we will be known for. Obviously, Victoria is very well-know from their series A Darker Shade of Magic, and it very well could be the greatest legacy that the world will know from them. Yet, they talk about how Addie LaRue is the book of their heart, and (I do not want to put any words in their mouth) it kind of felt like to me the book they may want the world to know them for. Yet, we never really get to choose what we are known for, do we? A very astounding concept to think about, truly, and one I couldn’t stop feeling deeply in my bones while I finished the last half of this book. Also, to think about how the human experiences could boil down to this hunger we all have to leave a mark on this world before we are forced to leave it all together? Very powerful stuff, truly. But I promise, V.E. Schwab and Addie Larue most definitely left their marks on me, and my heart, forever with this book.






""Humans are capable of such wondrous things. Of cruelty, and war, but also art and invention.""


Overall, this book made me yearn for so many things while also constantly making me question what it is to hunger. To crave your freedom, to crave someone who will see all the parts of you, to crave remembrance. I just feel like this book really touched on the human experience, but in such a incredibly raw and indistinguishably beautiful way. I really loved The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and it will without a doubt make my best of 2020 list. Thank you for letting me be a part of your story, thank you for always reading this part of mine, and I promise you will never be invisible to me.Youtube | Instagram | Twitter | Blog | Spotify | Twitch Trigger and Content Warnings: attempted assault, abuse depiction, loss of a loved one, substance abuse, depression depiction, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, and mention of cancer in the past.

347,The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,,4.07,"['August', '8,', '2023']","So this was...not very good.This is going to be another of those reviews where I open by saying I'm having a hard time articulating exactly what didn't work for me because on the surface it seems like this should be a tour de force. All the ""classic novel"" ingredients are here. But, having thought about it a bit I think that's the problem. The ingredients are here but nobody put them together very well.The story, when there is one, begins in the ruins of Chicken Hill, a neighborhood in Pottstown, PA that was once home to a vibrant community of Jews and African Americans who lived and worked together, striving to build lives in a world that was happy to use their labor and ingenuity as long as they remembered their place. Its the late 70's and following a hurricane most of Chicken Hill has been wiped off the map and in the ruins the police have discovered a man's skeletal remains. But who he is and why his bony hand was clutching a strange necklace is a mystery the police are unable to solve. Its also a mystery I completely forgot about in this overstuffed, meandering narrative that takes pages and pages and pages to go absolutely nowhere. James McBride is a beautiful writer. I mean that sincerely. But all the beautiful writing in the world can't make up for the endless parade of side plots and random character introductions that take the place of an actual coherent story.Nothing happens in this book. It is positively maddening and very, very strange.We're presented with a mystery; whose is the skeleton uncovered after the storm? Then for about 380 pages we are introduced to character after character after character who all have adorable folksy names and charming, convoluted, ""hilarious"" backstories that involve star crossed romance, traumatic family histories, or hair brained schemes that resulted in the weird nickname they now have or the strange limp they're walking with and it just goes on and on and on until I thought I was gonna scream. Then at around the 380 page mark McBride suddenly remembered the original plot and wraps everything up. There's also a startling lack of setting for a book that feels like it should be a very visceral reading experience. The idea of the Heaven and Earth Grocery Store is, I think, intended to be sort of the corner stone of the book. Its a store run by a Jewish woman who's sort of the ""heart"" of Chicken Hill. There's a lot of talk among other characters about how great she is but the reader never actually sees anything great happen. We also never really see the store, or Chicken Hill for that matter. Everything feels weirdly formless and void. There just isn't a strong sense of place at all. I couldn't tell you what anything looked like in this book.I feel like this book had absolutely no editor or guiding hand of any kind saying ""James I love what you're doing but you don't need forty supporting characters and they don't all need their own fifteen page origin stories.""I can't for the life of me work out what everyone else is seeing in this book that I'm missing.",2.0

But over the course of twenty-four hours, their lives will change forever.",4.04,"['May', '27,', '2021']","ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review white nuclear families will literally surf instead of going to therapy for their trauma this is one of those rare and extraordinary instances where my rage over a book propelled me through its pages at a speed i am totally unused to. i'm typically a slower reader, especially when losing myself in a world i love. this is because i enjoy soaking up details, really sitting with and unpacking the many layers that i've come to expect of long-form fiction. my experience with malibu rising was the utter opposite. i flew through the pages in a fit of wrath. if a five star novel is an onion, this was a single sheet of tissue paper. when i saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews this book has been racking up, i felt a similar confusion as i had last year, after finishing the invisible life of addie larue and finding that i was pretty alone in my dissatisfaction. i want to chalk this up to the fact that in both scenarios, i had never read a taylor jenkins reid or v.e. schwab book, respectively, and so had no biases or expectations coming into either book. i had never experienced these authors’ writing styles. i didn't know what to expect. i had no preconceived opinions to contend with. i was just along for the ride. part of me also wonders if maybe these books suffer from the cult classic syndrome so common on goodreads—the question of whether everyone genuinely enjoys these authors as much as they claim, or if, perhaps, their universal popularity among goodreads users has begun to affect the dimensions of public opinion/reviews. sometimes this website does feel like a bit of an echo chamber.i can't say for sure. i can only speak for myself when i write that i remain unmoved by author popularity or proclaimed talent. beloved books have no effect on me. neither do my goodreads friends' opinions (just as i'd hope my own opinions won't ""change"" anyone else's true feelings). even despite all of that, though, i know i'm not the wrong audience for these books. romance and found family are some of my favorite things to read about and when done well, it's not hard for a book to sway me, even with glaring faults.having said all of that, malibu rising was something of a disaster from start to finish. i feel like this preface is necessary because i know reid has garnered a very loyal fanbase. after combing through other reviews, i see that a few who have more extensive experience with her books feel this was a huge departure from fan favorites like daisy jones and the six and evelyn hugo. that's relieving to hear (even if i have no desire to ever pick up a book from this author again). this was very much commercial fiction and i'm wondering if that—commercial/genre trends—hasn't had some kind of effect on the quality of writing.before launching into the many issues i had with the novel, i want to warn you that i'm going to be laying out a good amount of spoilers.to begin to illustrate the many emotions i felt over the course of this novel, i have handpicked some annotation—of the 146 or so i jotted down—highlights from my kindle:• that's enough heterosexuality for today• fathers will be like hope i am not a person to you guys but a concept then disappear in a cloud of mist and wonder why you are deeply and irrevocably traumatized• what in the name of filler• IS IT EVERY BITCH IN THIS BOOK?• why i hate malibu rising? i will try to be brief (1/435)• and then the entire audience gasped• first plot point that doesn't piss me off (annotated 75% into the novel)• the men in this book: I HATE GETTING ACCUSED OF SOME SHIT I ACTUALLY DID 😡 WHO THE FUCK TOLD YOU• this reminds me of the great gatsby when jay is throwing the party to end all parties and then suddenly goes Everybody Log Out I Wanna Be alone with my hunny Rightnow LIKE BRO YOU LITERALLY INVITED THE ENTIRE TRISTATE AREA TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE? A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT• ""eww she fuck the tennis man for tennis balls"" - a bitch that's fucking the tennis man for Large Midcentury Unglazed Terracotta Planters on Standsnow, let me defend my one star rating. there are—generally speaking—three major components i look for in a novel and build a rating around (though they are often adjusted according to the parameters set by each individual book i read). plot is not listed among them because, in many cases, fully fleshed out characters are enough to carry a book for me. 1. writing2. characters3. worldto begin with: the writing. reid's is not particularly impressive. more often than not, i found the prose in this novel aggravating, prone to drama, awkwardly descriptive in places and absolutely barren in others. certain stylistic choices, like the third person omniscient perspective, make the novel feel clinical and impersonal—not because this perspective is inherently impersonal, but because reid's execution is. because the writing style keeps readers at arm's length, it does not feel like i know these characters. instead, it feels like i know someone else who does, someone relaying facts about people, with little to no introspection or interesting, informative character interaction. this drove me up the wall because i love third person omniscient—it might be my favorite point of view to both read and write—and i've seen it done fantastically, in ways that humanize characters, that make you feel intimately, humiliatingly connected to fictional people. this was not that.readers travel backwards and forwards through time, watching the story of the riva children's parents unfold in the past, then catapulting back into the present as these children grapple with what it means to grow up parentless in old hollywood over a 24 hour time period. the structure is designed to create an impression of cause and effect, but because reid lays it on so thick, vaulting back and forth through time quickly becomes tedious.since we're on the topic of laying it on thick: the melodrama, dialed all the way up, sits at a resting 100% throughout the novel, while any sense of reward falls flat. it's a lot like listening to a radio station that's nothing but static at the highest possible volume setting. i'm getting this outpouring of sound, but it's doing nothing for me, evokes no reaction, is more grating than it is gratifying.in a prologue that seems to want to emulate celeste ng's little fires everywhere, readers are informed through foreshadowing that nina riva's big hollywood party is doomed to end in flames. this prepares readers for a habit the narrative is guilty of repeatedly and unapologetically committing: melodramatic foreshadowing, or preemptive, godlike observations. sometimes this foreshadowing arrives chapters before a certain realization or reckoning unfolds in real time; sometimes, pages. others, mere paragraphs. this writing device colors the novel completely, making eventual emotional payoff feel cheap, and unearned. it blunts the impact of conflict, stifles anticipation, and turns a mounting sense of tension into a plateau of exhaustion. the consequence of this choice is that i was no longer willing to be surprised by reid's writing. i expected every plot twist. i saw things coming from a mile away. i was biding my time while i waited impatiently for the book to end, and even after finally getting my emotional vindication as things came to a close, i was left ultimately unsatisfied. why? because i'd figured out the plot of malibu rising by the 10% mark.this tediousness is never more true than with the novel's failed romance, which brings us to characters.in the goodreads version of this review, i'm only going to touch on one of those romances: june and mick riva. if you want my take on nina and brandon, you can check my blog.aside from the fact that mick is a grown man seducing a seventeen-year-old girl, we know from the beginning that his romance with june is doomed to end in tragedy. more of that pesky foreshadowing: ""the story of june and mick riva seemed like a tragedy to their oldest child, nina."" as readers come to learn, june is the victim of a serial cheater who up and abandons his children on a whim to fuck what we can only assume are hundreds of women (at times as young as eighteen) over the course of his music career, fathering clandestine children while married, divorcing his wife to remarry one of the many women he's having a public affair with, returning to briefly atone for his sins to his family, then running off to remarry again. and again. and again. it was exhausting to type that little summary out. now imagine reading an unreasonably drawn out retelling of that story, when you know every step of the way what kind of man mick is, and just how eagerly june is going to open her doors for him despite it.the worst part isn't the fact that june is cheated on, over and over, without remorse, while she sits at home performing domestic labor for her (ex-)husband. no. the worst offense is that mick is the crux of june's entire character.while he is permitted a career, a more fleshed out origin story, and desires wholly independent of the women of this world, all june ever aspires to be is the housewife and mother waiting at the window for her cheating husband to return. she has no personality beyond loving mick. from introduction until death, she is waiting and hoping mick will return in order to complete her, to give her what she needs to become a functioning human again. because, ""...to june, it was, always and forever, a romance.""that, to me, is most egregious.all the time spent trying to paint a picture of generational trauma to explain the gleeful ways in which mick exploits women for personal gain—the ways he sees them only insofar as they can perform for him as sexual objects—could have gone to understanding june and her family outside of a man.it is choices like these that sabotage the characters in malibu rising, which is a bit of a lead-in to its world. at times, i forgot that i wasn't reading contemporary fiction. it's only offhand details like random celebrity name-drops (occasionally real celebrities, occasionally fictional) that remind readers these characters are living in the past. malibu rising features a weak facsimile of old hollywood, only believable in that the men of this world are unrepentantly shitty and more often white than not. imagine if the great gatsby were a lifetime made-for-tv movie adaptation. that's the way this book reads.reid expends most of her effort trying to build a believable party in the second half of the novel that feels vintage enough to convince you it could be real. how is this achieved? no, not through lush detail and three-dimensional characters. through slipshod head-jumping. which brings me to my next point: filler.i would argue that over half of this novel is filler. in fact, i have counted at least nineteen filler chapters (or ""sections"") in this book—meaning, had they been discarded during the editing process or even condensed into larger combined chapters, the narrative landscape would have remained completely and totally unchanged. in other words, they serve no real purpose. they exist to take up time and space. in a book that is 384 pages long, this choice is particularly needless.malibu rising's second half (aptly called ""part two"") displays the very worst of this habit. as is often the case with sloppily executed omniscient narration, we head-jump from secondary character to secondary character—though i think calling them ""secondary characters"" is being generous; they're more like throwaway characters—spending brief, vignette-like interludes with hollywood caricatures who have no time to make any kind of lasting impression on readers. these filler sections are typically around 1-3 pages long and are characterized by washed up celebrities who are either a.) extremely horny, b.) looking to find their ""true love,"" or c.) some combination thereof. i can see that reid was attempting to humanize or at least fill up the party nina throws through these odd perspective shifts. and yet, rarely does the choice to inhabit secondary characters' heads pay off for writers. here, it is a spectacular failure. time that should gone to the riva siblings and their far more interesting chafing and tenderness is thrown away on...what...? censored threesomes? scummy movie stars groping women and getting away with it? in what world does a three page chapter outlining a celebrity's fictional film successes take precedence over actual plot and main character development? in malibu rising's second half, there are at least eighteen characters whose heads we're flitting to and from. yes, i counted. at times, these shifts aren't even marked by new chapters or sections. sometimes a perspective leap takes place over a single paragraph, in a fleeting interjection from one character before we melt back into whoever the book has decided is the main show for the moment. of over twenty badly written characters, i liked a total of two. nina and kit, one of which i was pleased to accurately predict was—spoiler—gay. the other pissed me off up until around the 80% mark, before her character development really kicked in and i finally breathed a sigh of relief. even still, the way the novel fought tooth and nail to try to convince us that mick is a complex man right up until the bitter end made this experience decidedly hair-pulling. if malibu rising wanted a morally grey character, the book did a terrible job characterizing him as such. he was unambiguously awful from start to finish. so throwing in lines like, “‘i think he’s an asshole. but i can’t be sure. i don’t actually know him well enough to say,’” from his own permanently traumatized child after we’ve spent 350+ pages watching him abandon his blood to live without either parent or even a stable income is more than a little patronizing. i mean, come on. can the novel have some backbone? this book gets one star from me because it didn’t check off any major components from my informal list and because i experienced not one ounce of personal enjoyment over the course of this harrowing journey. i wanted to rage-quit this book like a video game with bad graphics and worse writing more times than i can count. questions like, what do men have? fueled me for nearly 400 pages, all so i could give an answer i already, deep in my heart of hearts, knew: the audacity.if i had to sum up my feelings on this book using one of its own quotes, it would have to be...

349,A Calamity of Souls,,4.61,"['April', '16,', '2024']","***HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY***The premise of the novel isn’t entirely new - there have been other books about lawyers who take up the fight against racism in representing black clients unjustly accused. This novel however excels because of it’s characters!!It’s 1968 in southern Virginia, Fremont county, and a black man has been arrested for the murder of the wealthy white couple for whom he has worked for years. This story grabbed me from the first pages and didn’t let go. We are immediately thrust into the vitriol hatred that many of the white citizens had towards their black neighbors. The beginning scenes can be hard to stomach - but we know that these things occurred - and still occur today.Jack is a local white lawyer, he has never tried a murder case, but he is convinced of the man’s innocence. The case catches the attention of a black female lawyer, Desiree DuBose, from Chicago. She works many cases through the Legal Defense Fund and she wants to add her skills to this case.In time the two make a great pair. They will go through many obstacles including: handpicking the judge, allowing an entirely white jury, even threats on their lives, and more I will leave you to discover the incredible plot that unfolds throughout the book. It will make you sad, make you cry but in the end feel hope! There are still good people who are willing to continue the fight against racism. **The author’s note explains that this book has taken him over a decade to write. He put it aside to work on other projects however this story kept coming back to him. It also explains how some parts of the novel are “autobiographical elements in this story”. I really appreciated the notes at the beginning rather than the end of the novel - they explain a lot!I highly recommend this standalone novel from David Baldacci.

350,The Berry Pickers,"A four-year-old Mi’kmaq girl goes missing from the blueberry fields of Maine, sparking a tragic mystery that haunts the survivors, unravels a community, and remains unsolved for nearly fifty years.",4.17,"['April', '4,', '2023']","The Berry Pickers is an immersive and stunningly written debut novel by Amanda Peters. Every summer, a Mi’kmaq family travels from Nova Scotia to Maine to pick berries. A few weeks into the season, the youngest child, Ruthie, vanishes without a trace. Her older brother Joe was the last person to see her. That fact will sit heavy with him for years to come. Norma grows up in a wealthy household but is plagued with dreams that she cannot understand. And her loving but controlling mother refuses to discuss them. As Norma grows older, she realizes her parents are hiding something from her. This beautifully written novel follows Joe and Norma’s perspectives. This is a moving and powerful story with sprinkles of Indigenous humour here and there. It discusses the loss of language and culture, the threat of residential schools, and MMIW. But it also shines a light on the importance of family. Even with the heavier topics, there is a sense of hopefulness by the end. The story slowly drew me in, and by the end, I wished there were more pages. Both of the main characters completely captured my heart. I highly recommend adding this wonderful debut to your TBR as soon as possible. Thank you to Harper Perennial for providing an arc via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. https://booksandwheels.com",5.0
351,The Lost Apothecary,A female apothecary secretly dispenses poisons to liberate women from the men who have wronged them - setting three lives across centuries on a dangerous collision course.,3.75,"['March', '2,', '2021']","This concept needs to be confiscated from Sarah Penner immediately and given to literally any other writer. Between the lovely cover, the book of the month club endorsement and the promise of a Georgian female serial killer working on behalf of wronged women, I was so excited for this book. To say it was a letdown is a massive understatement. I was expecting a sort of “How’d she get away with it” revenge narrative about a woman who has been pushed to the brink by the cruelty of men and good-old-fashioned 1790s misogyny. I was expecting a deep dive into this woman’s character that would either be thrillerish or a more lighthearted caper-style romp. I was down for either of those. What I got was The Davinci Code: For Her. With an inexplicable dash of Julie & Julia. The story goes back and forth between 3 POV characters. There’s Nella, the apothecary owner who poisons people, Eliza the twelve-year-old girl who’s a little too chill about poisoning a guy, (so far so good), and then there’s Caroline. Caroline is a present-day character who finds a vial on the bank of the Thames that came from Nella’s apothecary. Caroline has just gone to London without her husband because she found out he was cheating on her. The book did a really good job of making me think her husband sucked right away—but it did an even better job of convincing me that Caroline sucked. She just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense and many of her actions defy any kind of human logic (same is true of her husband, I’ll get to that in a minute). Right away we find out that ~she’s not like other girls~ because while everyone else went to coffee shops in college, she poured over ~historical documents ~ and read ~novels from the 1800s~. Things no other college student has ever done. If you think I’m kidding here’s the actual line: “I could lose myself for hours in these seemingly meaningless documents, while my classmates met at coffee shops to study. I couldn’t attribute my unconventional interests to anything specific, I only knew that classroom debates about civil revolution and power-hungry world leaders left me yawning.” (Page 17) (Yes, somehow, we are not even 20 pages in). The first person makes that attitude especially insufferable. She then gets married to James, a man who seems hell bent on making her feel dumb. Great start. Shocked he cheated. Anyway, after college, Caroline seems to be angry that reading books and ~historical documents~ didn’t immediately get her a job. A twist no one saw coming. She almost applies to Cambridge but then doesn’t because she marries James the Jackass—and we all know that you can either have a degree or a husband. She chooses husband and her husband wants to stay in the states. Little known fact I learned from this book, literally no university in the states offers a master’s degree. They only count if they’re from Cambridge. Oxford isn’t mentioned so unclear if their masters’ degrees count for anything. Here’s where Caroline completely lost me: she kinda takes her anger about not being handed a job because she likes books out on… **checks notes** the books? Here’s a direct quote: “…thinking only briefly of the boxes still in our basement, packed away with the dozens of books I’d adored in school. Northanger Abbey, Rebecca, Mrs.Dalloway. What good had they done me?” She swears off books for good and gets a clerk job at her family’s farm. I have a lot of questions about that, but the novel answers none of them. She finally gets a job doing admin work for the family farm apparently unaware that you can still read books if you have a day job. Then she becomes obsessed with getting pregnant. We have not yet hit page 30. Spoilers beyond this point! (I highly recommend you don’t waste your time on this novel, but if you still think you might read it and care about spoilers this is a good place to stop). Here’s a quick rundown of the female characters in this book: Nella: Wishes she was pregnant. Caroline: Wished she was pregnant, spends majority of book thinking she is pregnant. Lady Clarence: Wants to murder her husband’s lover so she can get pregnant. Eliza: Is 12 and thankfully is not pregnant but she does think her period is a ghost which I think deserves an honorable mention. Gaynor: Is actually a historian and is, of course, exempt from pregnancy and thoughts thereof. Yikes. I would be willing to roll with this if it wasn’t such a high percentage of female characters and if it was examined or dealt with in any kind of thoughtful way. It is not. In fact, the desire to be pregnant/ have a child pops up in the weirdest ways at the weirdest times. Caroline by far wins most bizarre. Her husband is puking blood and the EMTs are telling her she should probably get rid of the stuff her husband ingested, especially if there are kids around. She then is upset that she doesn’t have a kid to potentially get poisoned / witness their father get carried away on a stretcher. Which brings me to another weird-ass plot point. James is so upset that Caroline is mad at him for having an affair he willingly drinks just a little bit of toxic Eucalyptus oil to…**checks notes again** get her to stop being mad at him via medical emergency. Because nothing says “honey, let’s get back together” like puking blood in a hotel room in foreign country. And then there’s Caroline’s discovery of the apothecary. This is where we get The Davinci Code: For Her. She finds the vial. Then she miraculously finds the apothecary. There’s just been this door in the middle of urban London that somehow no one else has seen since 1790. No one tore it down to build luxury flats! The Nazis bombed around it! Everyone who lives on that alley just kind of pretends it’s not there! She finds it in about two minutes. She finds all these documents inside from 1791, touches them with her bare hands, messes up one of them and then ultimately just takes cellphone pics and leaves them all there. She then tells Gaynor, her buddy at the British Library all about it and Gaynor thinks it’s interesting but sees no need to go get the documents out of the forgotten cellar thing. Historians and librarians are both known for being super chill about old documents being exposed to the elements, so this makes sense. Caroline then reads the pictures of the documents and reads some articles Gaynor the Historian found for her. She’s shocked to find out that they match up perfectly and she’s able to jump to all sorts of conclusions without so much as an additional Google search. Incredible research skills. All that time she spent not at coffee shops clearly paid off. You may be wondering what’s going on in the 1790s, apothecary of poisons part of the novel. You know, the part that sounded interesting. Well, it was somehow really boring despite there being two murders and a police chase. Oh, at one point the 12-year-old throws herself off of Blackfriars Bridge but she survives impact and icy water because she… **checks notes a third time** drank a tincture that made her really warm…At the end the police are pretty sure Nella is the poisoner they’re after, but ultimately let her go because they decide in the middle of the street, after the chase, that they don’t have enough evidence to arrest a low-ish class woman. So that’s nice of them. Really feels authentic for 1791. At the end of the book Caroline does dump James & the Giant Jackass, but possibly only temporarily. There’s an implication that after some time apart and after Caroline finishes her masters’ degree in Cambridge they could get back together. It’s left open-ended. I don’t have a joke here, I just hate that. Caroline does submit an application to Cambridge. I guess she forgave the books for not getting her a job after all. It’ll be tough to get in of course. Especially because that’s literally the only school where you can get a Master’s. She talks to Gaynor The Actual Professional Researcher about how she wants to write a dissertation about the apothecary. Guess what Caroline is getting a degree in? If you guessed History you are entirely too logical for this novel. No, she’s getting a degree in English literature specifically she’s applied for a program that covers “18th century and Romanticism” You may notice that’s two centuries and two very different periods of literature jammed together, but at this point who’s counting.This book ends all too soon. We are robbed of the Cambridge professor’s reaction when she tells them her dissertation will be—not on a work of literature—but a ledger she found in a mysterious basement. Would love to be a fly on the wall for that one. In short, my sanity has suffered. 0/10 do not recommend.",1.0
352,The Dutch House,,4.10,"['September', '24,', '2019']","So close to be a masterpiece, a dysfunctional family story starts in this humongous, grandiose mansion, where ex inhabitants had died and left their belongings including their portraits hanging on the walls and it ends there as we move back and forth between the timelines to read the story narrated by Danny, second child of the family. But please go and order an audiobook because TOM HANKS is fantastic, impeccable, meticulous narrator. (Yes, he is our Danny boy). So as a result paperback version: 4 stars Audiobook: 5 stars Let’s rounded 4.5 up to 5 celebration of master story telling stars!I started to read the book and I was about to give four stars ! Please, don’t get me wrong, I love the writing and those vivid characters, I was about to give million slaps to one of them: Yes, EVIL STEPMOM ANDREA, I’m talking about you! But slow pace and too many jumping between time lines a little exhausted me. But as soon as I learned Tom Hanks is on the board, I stopped reading and I started listening to the book with a huge smile on my face. Danny and Maeve will always stay on my mind and heart as amazing siblings. Their mother abandoned them. (Actually she was another version of Mother Theresa and she rejected to live in a mansion when too many poor people suffer out there so she left the place. She still loved her husband and she didn’t intend to leave her children. Her belief as social responsibilities always come first even it means to neglect her own family is irritated me so much! I’m not quite fan of this character. But thanks God, we have evil stepmother to hate more!) And their father passed away when he was only 53. They both lost their parents at young age but what they didn’t know they would be also homeless with great scheme her stepmother dearest had planned details with her lawyer. She got the control of the business of their father and she got the Dutch House to live with her two daughters. So she kicked her step kids out. She even tried to prevent Danny take money from trust fund for his education because Danny chose an expensive school and her own daughters couldn’t get the highest education they need, if all the money would spend for Danny’s needs. (At least her attempts were stopped by their father’s lawyer this time. I think Andrea deserved a special place in hell but in my opinion, hell would be like a spa treatment for her!) So all the losses they suffered, keep united this brother and sister against the entire world. They became each other’s priorities and supported each other for every big life decisions. (Maeve helped him to connect with his future wife even they didn’t get along for a long time and resented each other!) They grew up, but they resumed going to the Dutch House and stopped their cars in front of the place, waited to see any activity around or inside and they left. THAT BECAME THEIR ROUTINE FOR YEARS like visiting an old relative they check randomly to make sure she’ still alive!Years passed, they got old. They resumed going back there…Till one day their mother returned back and requested them to drive her to the house and finally she bangs on the door to meet with Andrea. That is the beginning of some endings! The house was like a living and functioning organism marked the milestones of the sibling’s lives and changed them forever. Past and future combined with sadness, regrets, resentments, sister and brother’s devotion, marriage, nostalgia, childhood memories, unfinished businesses, yearning for real and functional family, life decisions.  As the life moved on , two siblings’ a special piece of their hearts always stayed with that house, buried there, even they thought they moved on but they couldn’t. Because house gave them hope that one day their mother could return. House made them grow up earlier. House made them connect with their maids, nanny ( also mistress of their father) and many childhood happy memories. Even they’ve kicked out, they have never left the place and the house never left them, too. It left a vulnerable scar on their mind and soul.

353,The Hotel Nantucket,,4.06,"['June', '14,', '2022']","Ah, is there a more satisfying feeling than finding the perfect beach read during the waning days of summer?I can't believe this is Elin Hilderbrand's 28th novel (of which I've only read a paltry few)! I'm always a little hesitant when an author has been around for so long. What if they've lost their verve and zest for writing and are now just doing it to put out one more book? But gosh, I didn't need to worry at all.The Hotel Nantucket was the consummate summer reading experience. It transported me to Nantucket, and I fell in love with the island, the atmosphere, and all the wonderful characters. Instead of focusing solely on one or two individuals, this story is more of an ensemble cast, with many characters taking up the pages. And while that took me a few chapters to get into, once I did, I was all in. I can honestly say there wasn't a single character I wasn't fond of, and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know everyone and seeing them grow through the pages.If I had to nitpick something, it would be that there were two characters with almost the same name. There's Sweet Edie (a main character) and Fast Eddie (only a side one). Thankfully, Fast Eddie only appears a few times, though it did confuse me every time he did. But I really had to reach hard to come up with this minor quibble.No doubt about it, I just about savored every moment of this book. I read it almost entirely outside, soaking up the sunshine and with various fruit-flavored bubble teas in hand. Summers are so special and inevitably too short. Especially this year, having lost half of my summer due to moving and feeling unwell, I'm doubly thankful to have found this gem of a story. It totally buoyed my spirits and added that extra spark to my otherwise abbreviated summer.Now my only remaining question is: could the ending have been a teensy-weensy wink towards a sequel?

357,The Rose Code,The New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of The Huntress and The Alice Network returns with another heart-stopping World War II story of three female code breakers at Bletchley Park and the spy they must root out after the war is over.,4.45,"['March', '9,', '2021']","***IF YOU READ ONE HISTORICAL FICTION THIS YEAR, THIS SHOULD BE IT, IN PAPERBACK NOW***I absolutely love Kate Quinn, I have been waiting for a new book from her ever since her last novel “The Huntress”. I love her novels about women spies. The Rose Code is something a bit different. This novel focuses on three very different women who come together to help the British solve the codes that the Germans have been sending back and forth to their troops, leaders, etc.This novel isn’t short, at 656 pages, it’s not a quick read. I savored it, let myself get lost in it and allowed myself time for all of the imagery, information and wonderful characters to sink in. I became lost in the story almost immediately. The time frame is 1940 through 1947. We begin with the introductions of characters and how they all meet up at Bletchley Circle. Mab lived a life of poverty and was determined to find a man to marry, someone of some means to help her rise to a level where she didn’t have to worry every day about how she would get by. She ends up being adept at fixing the machines that the codebreakers use. Osla has come from a family of wealth. She has been dating Phillip for years and they have a friendship/love relationship for many years. She wants to help in the war effort and not just making bandages!! She wants to show that a “deb” can be more than just a showpiece. She is fluent in German and is ultimately used as a translator, essential to the codebreaking process.Beth is a quiet, timid young woman who has lived with her parents and has always been put down by her mother. Taught that she had no value, wasn’t good at anything, not even allowed to finish school. But she has a gift for mathematics and puzzle solving and at Bletchley Circle she finds her niche. She becomes one of the top cryptanalysts and is heads above everyone else she works with. She will find her wings here.Besides all of the intricacies of Bletchley park, all of the secrets that these people are sworn to keep, there is a resounding story of friendship, love and humor. All of those that work here, many for 24 hours straight, find their ways to have fun. They sing, they laugh, they find love and acceptance, all combined in the effort to help win the war for the Allies.This is a bare outline of the characters but there is lots of interaction between these three women, they become best friends, until tragedy strikes. They then are split apart for many years.’We flash ahead to 1947 and Beth is locked away in an asylum, thought to have “had a breakdown”. In reality she has been unjustly accused and knows a terrible secret -- there was a traitor at Bletchley park and she knows who it is. This is the one who put her here, and there are only two people whom she trusts can help her escape the asylum -- Mab and Osla!!These three indomitable women will come together once again to capture the spy who traded their security, the future of the war effort and love of country, for money. I’ll leave you to discover who the traitor was and how the story unfolds, just like looking down at the spirals inside a rose!!This is by far the best historical fiction I have read in a very long time! The last sections of the book are tense, action packed and will have you reading with all of your senses on high alert!If you enjoy this book I recommend watching the PBS series Bletchley Circle and here is also a link to an interview with Kate Quinn below. https://historicalfictionreader.blogs...I highly recommend this novel to all lovers of historical fiction, you will find a wonderful novel based on facts. You won’t easily forget these characters, they will stay with me for a long time.This was a buddy read with my good friend CeeCee who also loved the novel.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.This novel is set to release on March 9, 2021",5.0

""In the end, the monster we feared didn’t come from Hell. He came from privilege.""

Oh, this review is going to be a wild ride. The range of things I feel for this book is very unreal. Listen, the atmosphere of this? The settings? The premise? I couldn’t get enough. Dare I even say close to perfect? And the plot had me so very invested in every single way. But this actual story and the plot conveniences, the characters and their lack of critical thinking, the obvious plot twists? The Lord might be testing me. The whiplash I felt while reading this was a full experience and deserves a star rating of its own, truly.When you open this book for the first time, the prologue will transport you to a stormy night in 19th century Italy, where two little twin girls are being gifted very special necklaces while slowly learning their witch powers and history from their grandmother. There are seven demon princes but only 4 the witches should fear, but somehow their necklaces will keep them safe, even though they are instructed to never place them together.

""One will crave your blood. One will capture your heart. One will steal your soul. And one will take your life.""

Then the story actually takes place ten years in the future, where Emilia and Vittoria are now eighteen-years-old, but we see how that night has shaped their lives for the last decade in so many different ways, but for sure centering on those necklaces that were entrusted to them. Both girls are trying to help their family with their restaurant, find and follow their dreams, and lead normal lives, but they soon find out that normal and safe and happy was never in the cards for them.Again, I do not want to give much away, because I think I very much benefited from not reading the synopsis of this story. But the gates of hell are weakening, and their city and family are no longer safe. Not only do they have to worry about hiding the fact that they are witches, but now they have to worry about demon princes, witch hunters, and other creatures that go bump in the night! But Emilia is thrust in the heart of it all, with her witchcraft on full display, when she makes a deal with a demon when she is most desperate.Together, Emilia and Wrath (be still, my BDB heart) are forced to work together to investigate brutal and mysterious murders that are happening, but they are both looking for clues for very different reasons. My favorite part of this book was truly going alongside Emilia and seeing all these different settings. From secret casinos, to her family’s kitchen, surprise palaces, spooky beaches, to the scary and dark corridors within the church, I couldn’t get enough of all the different adventures in all the different places.

""Grief carved me in half. And fury honed the pieces into a weapon.""

I really loved the depiction of grief and depression in this book, too. How the weight of sadness can be unbearable, especially alone, when your world and future are taken from you right before your eyes. I also think Kerri Maniscalco did a really good job portraying not only the different stages that can be held within grief, but to also tell the reader that there is truly no wrong way to grieve. Heartbreak can be sadness and pain, but it can also be anger and revenge.I also did really enjoy the romance and I think if you are looking to indulge in a new OTP that will remind you of 2015 then you are in luck with this one! I did enjoy Wrath a lot more than Emilia for the most part, but I feel like the plot convenience (and Emilia acting stupid) was the downfall of this book. I am not good at unraveling mysteries, but I truly unraveled this one instantly, I only wish Emilia could have a little sooner and it made the reading experience a bit annoying. Also, she gets upset at the strangest things, and wholeheartedly accepts the wildest things for no reason. I truly feel like her character was mostly used to move the book along conveniently instead of actually making her feel like a main character with depth and identity.Also, I’m just going to say it, the grandmother in this book is one of the most infuriating characters I’ve read about all 2020. Like, regardless of prophecies, how are you going to be this mysterious with eight-year-old little girls and then really not fill them in on any blanks for the next ten years of their lives too? The grandma is really written to look like this cool and wise character who helps save the day, but I truly could not stand her or her shocked reaction when things would fall apart around her.On top of the mysteries in this book being a bit of a letdown, I will also say that I felt like so many big events in this book kind of happened just for (hopefully) set ups for the next installment. I’m all for setting up things in early books, but it just kind of feels bad when absolutely nothing happens regarding these big chapters after the scene has ended. I feel like if this book felt more cohesive throughout, instead of just setting up for what is to come, I would have gotten so much of a higher rating from me, but I have to rate and review off the material that is given to me and it made for a bit of an infuriating reading experience.

""Man had a funny way of blaming the devil for things he didn’t like.""

Overall, I couldn’t put this book down. Truly. And I would bet you a great sum of money that I will also pick up the next one, because this book ended on a very perfect cliffhanger set up that I greedily want to know everything about. This book really did give me nostalgic feels for some reason, it made me very hungry most of the time, and it made me truly never want to put it down. The writing is so easily consumable, and I really did fall in love with the setting and plot set up. I only wish it felt a little bit more like a full story and not just a set up book. I still predict that this book will do really well, and I think most people will have a very good reading experience with this with.Trigger and Content Warnings: gore, violence, blood depiction, self-harm to get blood for spells, loss of a loved one, grief depiction, murder, death, brief mention of unwanted touching, and magical compulsion.Blog | Instagram | Youtube | Ko-fi | Spotify | Twitch Buddy read with Maëlys & Lea! ❤",3.0

I think this book shocked me in how many deeper themes and messages it had, considering I read most thrillers to just have fun and be a quick paced read. The past and present timelines having parallels between characters was really cool to examine, but I had a hard time connecting to the 1974 timeline for the first half of the book. I loved the frenemy plot between Emily and Chess, and the explosion at the end between the two of them was exactly what I wanted it to be with Chess manipulating Emily so well that even you as the reader have to remember what’s true and not true!

360,The Book Thief,,4.39,"['September', '1,', '2005']","Just to clarify: Yes, I did cry.I've read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book. I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.Quick test to see if you'll like this book:1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?3. Do you like words?(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).So, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.Two incidents set me off lately.1.	My neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.2.	I was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you’ve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let’s just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he’d said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it’s about time “somebody did something”. (Fuck me, I’ve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they’re referring to? Do they actually know? I’ve yet to hear them pronounce what this “something” is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I’m not aware of that they’re referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)To my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven’t really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven’t spoken to her since.The Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn’t even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn’t spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.Instead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren’t really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we’d never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They’re not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they’re still poor. They’re the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they’re not the good guys either. They don’t speak up for the Jewish people, they don’t try to change popular opinion, they don’t stand for what’s right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.So you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I’m one of the “good guys” when I don’t stand up for people either? Shouldn’t I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn’t I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn’t I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn’t I have asked her why she’s spreading propaganda? Couldn’t I have probed her to think critically about this man’s claims, about facts and ethics? No. I didn’t want to cause problems and I didn’t want to make waves.The narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler’s took over a country and started a war – not with guns or weapons but with words. I’ve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him. When I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don’t fill a child’s head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It’s kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.Well, I agree. When you don’t educate people, when you don’t teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future – a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be – and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet. Coincidently when you don’t speak up, when you don’t proclaim the truth, when you’re too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you’re no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can’t imagine how my friends would feel if they’d known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine – and rightfully so.And now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn’t like this book – the narrator.The Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn’t feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we’re all guilty – and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there’s a sense that we’re all going down together. When we’re damned, at least we’ll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment. I don’t mind being stripped down. I don’t mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story. I loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights. For some reason, that thought makes me very happy.",4.0
361,All the Light We Cannot See,,4.32,"['May', '6,', '2014']","4/20/15 - PULITZER WINNER for 2014

 The brain is locked in total darkness of course, children, says the voice. It floats in a clear liquid inside the skull, never in the light. And yet the world it constructs in the mind is full of light. It brims with color and movement. So how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?

Marie Laure LeBlanc is a teen who had gone blind at age 6. She and her father, Daniel, fled Paris ahead of the German invasion, arriving in the ancient walled port city of Saint Malo in northwest France to stay with M-L’s great uncle, Etienne. His PTSD from WW I had kept him indoors for two decades. They bring with them a large and infamous diamond, to save it from the Nazis. Daniel had made a scale model of their neighborhood in Paris to help young Marie Laure learn her away around, and repeats the project in Saint Malo, which is eventually occupied by the German army.Werner and Jutta Pfennig are raised in a German orphanage after their father is killed in the local mine. Werner has a gift for electronics, and is sent to a special school where, despite the many horrors of the experience, his talent is nurtured. He develops technology for locating radio sources, and is rushed into the Wehrmacht to apply his skill in the war. His assignment brings him to Saint Malo, where his path and Marie Laure’s intersect. Anthony Doerr There are three primary time streams here, 1944 as the Allies are assaulting the German-held town, 1940-44, as we follow the progress of Werner and Marie Laure to their intersection, and the 1930s. We see the boy and the girl as children, and are presented with mirrored events in their young lives that will define in large measure the years to follow. Werner and Jutta are mesmerized by a French radio broadcast, a respite from the anti-Semitic propaganda the government is broadcasting. The Professor in the French broadcast offers lectures on science, and inspires Werner to dream of a life beyond the orphanage. 
Open your eyes, concluded the man, and see what you can with them before they close forever,  and then a piano comes on, playing a lonely song that sounds to Werner like a golden boat traveling a dark river, a progression of harmonies that transfigures Zollverein: the houses turned to mist, the mines filled in, the smokestacks fallen, an ancient sea spilling through the streets, and the air streaming with possibility.
As her father is the head locksmith for the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, Marie Laure has the run of the place. She spends a lot of time with a professor there, learning everything she can about shells, mollusks and snails.
Dr. Geffard teaches her the names of shells--Lambis lambis, Cypraea moneta, Lophiotoma acuta--and lets her feel the spines and apertures and whorls of each in turn. He explains the branches of marine evolution and the sequences of the geologic periods; on her best days, she glimpses the limitless span of millennia behind her: millions of years, tens of millions of years.
Both Werner and Marie Laure are enriched by teachers and books as they grow. No nuclear families here. Marie Laure’s mother died in childbirth. The Pfennig children lost their remaining parent when father was killed in the mine. The author, in a video on his site, talks about the three pieces of inspiration that provided the superstructure for the novel. While 80 feet below ground in a NYC subway, a fellow passenger was griping about the loss of cell service. Doerr appreciates the beautiful miracle that is modern communications.  At the start of the book I wanted to try to capture the magic of hearing the voice of a stranger in a little device in your home because for the history of humanity, that was a strange thing. I started with a boy trapped somewhere and a girl reading a story. A year later he was on a book tour in France and saw Saint Malo for the first time. Walking around this beautiful seaside town, a walled fortress, the beautiful channel, the green water of the channel breaking against the walls and I told my editor, “look how old this is. This medieval town’s so pretty.” He said, “actually, this town was almost entirely destroyed in 1944, by your country, by American bombs.” So I started researching a lot about the city of Saint Malo immediately and knew that was the setting. That was where the boy would be trapped, listening to the radio. The third piece arrived when Doerr learned that when the Germans invaded, the French hid not only their artistic treasures but their important natural history and gemological holdings as well.The story is told primarily in alternating Marie Laure’s and Werner’s experiences. But there is a third stream as well, that of Sgt Major Reinhold von Rumpel, a gem appraiser drafted by the Reich to examine the jewels captured by the military and collect the best for a special collection. He becomes obsessed with finding the Sea of Flames, the near mythic diamond Daniel LeBlanc had hidden away. He is pretty much the prototypical evil Nazi, completely corrupt, greedy, cruel, as close to a stick-figure characterization as there is in the book. But his evil-doing provides the danger needed to move the story forward. There may not be words sufficient to exclaim just how magnificent an accomplishment this book is. Amazing, spectacular, incredible, moving, engaging, emotional, gripping, celestial, soulful, and bloody fracking brilliant might give some indication. There is so much going on here. One can read it for the story alone and come away satisfied. But there is such amazing craft on display that the book rewards a closer reading. In addition to a deft application of mirroring in the experiences of Werner and Marie Laure, Doerr brings a poet’s sense of imagery and magic. Marie-Laure’s sense of the world is filled with shell, snail, and mollusk experiences and references. Some are simple. During a time of intense stress, she must live like the snails, moment to moment, centimeter to centimeter. In a moment of hopeful reflection,  these tiny wet beings straining calcium from the water and spinning it into polished dreams on their backs—it is enough. More than enough. You will find many more scattered about like you-know-what on a beach.  I knew early on that I wanted her to be interested in shells. I'm standing here at the ocean right now. I've always been so interested in both the visual beauty of mollusks and the tactile feel of them. As a kid, I collected them all the time. That really imbued both ""The Shell Collector"" and Marie with, Why does the natural world bother to be so beautiful? For me, that's really embodied in seashells. I knew early on that I wanted her to find a path to pursue her interest in shells. I think that fits — I hope that fits — with visual impairment, using your fingers to identify them and admire them. - from the Powell’s reviewWerner’s snowy white hair alone might stand in for the entirety of the visible spectrum. (although it is described as “a color that is the absence of color.”) The dreaded prospect of being forced to work in the mines in a literally coal-black environment, the very antithesis of light, offers motivation for Werner to find another path, and coal itself offers a balance for that other form of carbon that drives Marie Laure’s father out of Paris, the one that embodies light. While black and white are often used in describing Werner’s environment, the broader spectrum figures large in his descriptions.
Werner liked to crouch in his dormer and imagine radio waves like mile-long harp strings, bending and vibrating over Zollverein, flying through forests, through cities, through walls. At midnight he and Jutta prowl the ionosphere, searching for that lavish, penetrating voice. When they find it, Werner feels as if he has been launched into a different existence, a secret place where great discoveries are possible, where an orphan from a coal town can solve some vital mystery hidden in the physical world.
A nice additional touch is Marie Laure’s reading of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It permeates the tale as her reading echoes events and tensions in the real world of the story. Also avian imagery is a frequent, soulful presence. A particularly moving moment is when a damaged character is reminded of a long-lost friend (or maybe a long-remembered fear?) by the presence of a particular bird associated with that friend and the time when they knew each other.There are substantive issues addressed in this National Book Award finalist. Moral choices must be made about how to respond when darkness seeks to extinguish the light. There are powerful instances in which different characters withdraw into their shells in response to evil, but others in which they rage against the night with their actions. Thoughtful characters question the morality of their actions, as dark-siders plunge into the moral abyss. Sometimes the plunge is steep and immediate, but for others it is made clear that innocence can be corrupted, bit by bit. The major characters, and a few of the secondary ones, are very well drawn. You will most definitely care what happens to them.As for gripes, few and far between. There is a tendency at times to tell rather than show. Marie Laure may be too good. That’s about it. There are sure to be some who find this story too emotional. I am not among them.Just as Werner perceives or imagines he perceives an invisible world of radiowaves, All the Light We Cannot See enriches the reader with a spectrum of imagery, of meaning, of feeling. You may need eyes to read the page, ears to hear if listening to an audio version, or sensitive, educated fingers to read a Braille volume (please tell me this book has been published in Braille), but the waves with which Doerr has constructed his masterwork will permeate your reading experience. They may not be entirely apparent to your senses the first time you read this book. They are there. Whether you see, hear or touch them, or miss them entirely, they are there, and they will fill you. All the Light We Cannot See is a dazzling novel. When you read it, you will see.

And if you are wondering what he had in mind, specifically, with the title: It’s a reference first and foremost to all the light we literally cannot see: that is, the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are beyond the ability of human eyes to detect (radio waves, of course, being the most relevant). It’s also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within World War II — that stories of ordinary children, for example, are a kind of light we do not typically see. Ultimately, the title is intended as a suggestion that we spend too much time focused on only a small slice of the spectrum of possibility. - from Doerr’s siteInterview by Jill Owens for Powell’sTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea for free on Project GutenbergHere’s the wiki page for Saint MaloAn interesting article on the damage done to Saint Malo in the 1944 battleA page on the surrender of Saint Malo, from the site  World War II Today Here is a nice, large  panoramic shot  of modern Saint Malo, far too wide to include hereDoerr adds a lot to our understanding of the book with his Notes and Highlights commentary here on GR4/20/15 - Pulitzer prize winners were announced today, and All the Light shines brightest for fiction6/27/15 - All the Light We Cannot See is awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in FictionNovember 2018 = All the Light is among the semi-finalists for GR's Best of the Best AwardJanuary, 2022- Netflix announces that All the Light is being made into a four-part series, starring Mark Ruffalo and Hugh Laurie.",5.0
362,The Nightingale,"In love we find out who we want to be.In war we find out who we are.FRANCE, 1939",4.62,"['October', '8,', '2015']","I really tried, you guys. There was even a 20% period when my standards were reduced so low from the previous 70%, that I thought maybe, maybe 2*. But the last 10% was offensive. Yes, I said offensive. Review later. And by review, I mean bitch rant fest.---------People keep asking me how I didn’t like this book. Honestly, I want to ask them how they did.Never have I ever read a book by such a clueless, air-headed author.And I actually don’t even mean that to be mean, or to pick on KH. It’s just that quite frankly, those are the truest words to describe what was obviously in Hannah’s mind when she wrote this book: nothing.She forgets what she writes a chapter, a page, a paragraph, hell, in a few instances, even one sentence, earlier. Examples? Mais oui, but of course! 1. She forgets to age characters (this in the first chapter. Isabelle is 4 and Vianne is 14 when their mother dies. Vianne is taken crying to Le Jardin and falls in love. At 16, she’s pregnant, at 17 she has a miscarriage. Then, of her miscarriage, Hannah writes: “She’d crawled into her grief and cocooned it around her, unable to care about anyone or anything—certainly not a needy, wailing four-year-old-sister.”)2. She forgets the weather. Isabelle treks out of the house pre-dawn in “knee-deep snow” and then steals a bicycle that same morning from an SS officer who is across the street in a cafe. Okay, so I’m from Ottawa, which in 2015 was the coldest capital ON EARTH. I’ll PRETEND you can actually ride a bicycle in “knee-deep” snow (you can’t). But Isabelle takes the bike straight to Henri’s apartment to hide it—I’m sorry but TRACKS?!?!?! The SS officer will walk out of the cafe, see the missing bike…and see tire marks that lead straight to the French Resistance headquarters. Or do you want to tell me people were plowing the streets in this village of a 1000 people?!3. She forgets the season. Winter temperatures Isabelle climbs over a rose-covered wall. WHICH, to be fair to Hannah, I live in Tuscany, where roses do grow on some mild winter days. But roses certainly are not growing in Carriveau in the wintertime because...4. She forgets CLIMATE. Again, I’m from Ottawa. Hannah’s descriptions of this French winter in her imaginary town in the Loire Valley seem to be inspired by the Arctic Tundra, because she’s got (wait for it, ARE YOU READY?) knee-deep snow, hail, ice rain, sleet, frosted windows, “ice-sheened glass” and “frost-limned windows”, “she didn’t want to go out into the cold white world again … she stepped over the threshold … and out into the snowstorm”, “Bending forward, angling into the wind, she trudged through the wet, heavy snow … hit the ground, cracked her head on the snow-covered step”.5. She forgets where her characters are placed (in one instance, Vianne exits her bedroom in the middle of the night to write down the Jewish children’s names on the kitchen table, then finishes her job, leans back, thinks about her own kids for a bit…then reaches out and strokes her sleeping children’s heads, then cuddles in bed with them).6. She forgets when characters have no money. Vianne stuffs newspaper print in her coat for extra warmth and gets a tin can of oil in the queue…but has money to just hop on a train to see Isabelle in prison. Forget the permits she would need since by then ALL OF FRANCE was occupied.She also doesn’t seem to understand the definition of several key words in her novel: refugee, garden, village, poor. 
REFUGEE:
 is 
NOT
 local inhabitants of a city under attack fleeing to distant relatives in the countryside or neighboring towns, or lodging in hotels in the countryside or neighboring towns. I also took a lot of issue with how Hannah describes these fleeing locals. 1. Chaos. Dust. Crowds. The street was a living, breathing dragon of humanity, inching forward, wheezing dirt, honking horns; people yelling for help, babies crying, and the smell of sweat heavy in the air.2. like flotsam in the reeds of a muddy river3. Like a thousand-legged centipede, the crowd moved forward into the great hall. [Side rant: as for this “thousand-legged centipede” does she perhaps mean a MILLIPEDE?!]4. The refugees who had arrived before her would have moved through the town like locusts, buying every foodstuff on the shelves.5. clothes so tattered and patched she was reminded of the war refugees who’d so recently shuffled through Paris, hoarding cigarettes and bits of paper and empty bottles, begging for change or help. [Isabelle, when meeting Gaetan—notice how she’s not part of these “war refugees” even though SHE WAS.]6. There were dozens of people in her yard; mostly women and children, moving like a pack of hungry wolves. Their voices melded into a single desperate growl.7. The crowd surged around him like water around a rockNotice how they’re all…not human? Lumped into a collective beast (a dragon, rushing water, millipede, pack of growling, hungry wolves) that is THE REFUGEES? But what’s more sickening about all of this is that Isabelle was part of them, and yet never once does Hannah include her in these ominous descriptions of (dun dun dun dunnnnn) THE REFUGEES. Instead, she was getting kissed by the handsome Gaetan, because she’s above the smelliness of refugee status, apparently. Also, we’re reminded three times throughout the book that “the refugees” broke Vianne’s gate. This kind of language that dehumanizes refugees needs to stop.
GARDEN:
 Le Jardin is supposedly a garden, and literally means “The Garden” in French. But this “garden” is a fucking farm because in a 1940 French village it has chickens, rabbits (both plural), a stone wall covering all of it, a BARN with a car inside it, and ANOTHER cellar, a hill with a “hillside between the garden and the barn” and is so big that Isabelle can come in the middle of the night with three communists and move the car in the barn and hide a dead body and Vianne, inside at home, HEARS NOTHING. More implausible still, even after the wall was torn down, not ONE of the poor, starving French people broke in to steal her fruits, vegetables, and live stock. 
VILLAGE:
 This village of 1000 people has Nazis, SS, and Gestapo, and a networked train system. 
POOR (Part I):
 Seriously guys, what class were these people? Farmers? Because they own a farm. Village people? Nope, because they have expensive silverware, Limoges plates, Alençon lace, original impressionist paintings, and a spare bedroom. Let’s break down the math. Isabelle is 19 in 1939. She is 10 years younger than Vianne. So Vianne was born in approx. 1910. Which means…despite a dead mother, a drunk absent father throughout her entire life, growing up in WWI, living through the GREAT DEPRESSION that followed, getting pregnant at 16 (and going to university while pregnant, according to Hannah) miraculously her and her parents had money (they live in a house a mile away from a village of 1000 people, keep in mind), for a car and to put both girls in university. A car, a property with an acre of land, university for both daughters—I mean, I’m jealous here in 2016. Isabelle is bilingual, and knows how to drive a car, and is 19 years old and still in boarding schools in 1940 France, LEARNING TO CUT AN ORANGE. I just can’t stress the time period enough. Getting kicked out, no less, for failing to learn how to cut an orange. At 19. So then who taught her English, if her school was so worthless? I doubt it was her dead mother or absent father. To say nothing of the fact that back then at 19 you should be married. 
POOR (Part II):
 During the war, they were eating cats and rats. People were stealing bread. There was nothing. Salt was precious as gold and used for preserving food, NEVER for seasoning it. Some examples of starvation during wartime poverty in this book:1. but what about the coming winter? How could Sophie stay healthy without meat or milk or cheese? [Because bread, vegetables, and fruits were in abundance in wartime winters] 2. She had sold off her family’s treasures one by one: a painting to feed the rabbits and chickens through the winter [EAT. THE FUCKING. RABBITS. This is Europe in the 1940s for fuck’s sake. Eat the goddamn rabbits.]3. Moments later, she carried out a heavy ceramic tray bearing the fried fish surrounded by the pan-roasted vegetables and preserved lemons, all of it enhanced with fresh parsley. The tangy, lemony sauce in the bottom of the pan, swimming with crusty brown bits, could have benefited from butter, but still it smelled heavenly. [Wartime poverty equals no butter, got it.]3. “There is no food here in the city, Isabelle ... People are raising Guinea pigs for food. You will be more comfortable in the country, where there are gardens.” [As long as you have a garden, you’re fine.]4. Vianne began finely chopping the mutton. She added a precious egg to the mix, and stale bread, then seasoned it with salt and pepper.This book read more like a Mediterranean slim fast diet and a vintage fashion catalog than anything else. Other than Hannah constantly saying how much they were losing weight and starving and going without, I would never have known. Take away her adjectives like stale and precious, and it’s fucking gourmet.If this book wasn’t so heavily inspired by Andrée De Jongh, I might not be so harsh on it. But it is. So, yes, a woman who WAS a war hero, after working for the Red Cross, who set up the Comet Line with her father, went to a concentration camp, survived—for Hannah to sentimentalise her life the way she did, it IS offensive. By focusing so heavily on Isabelle’s beauty, and having Isabelle’s beauty be the reason she so easily slides past the Nazis (even Isabelle admits this!), Hannah is actually ROBBING De Jongh of her strength, courage, power, heroism. And I have a bone to pick with Hannah: the real Andrée De Jongh was not blond. I find it wrong for a blond American author to take a real woman, change her short curly black hair and add long blond hair instead (hair so pretty when Beck comments on it, SHE CUTS IT OFF), and then start saying she’s “impossibly beautiful.” Especially in a book about WWII, where Hitler was prejudiced to anyone who was not of blond hair, blue eyed Aryan race. What the hell?!?!This book is no more historical fiction than Disney is a true retelling of the Brothers Grimm stories. Which gets even WORSE when you start looking at what Hannah opted to change from the real De Jongh. No mention of a spouse, in later life or during the war effort, is mentioned for De Jongh. She survived the concentration camp and lived until she was 90. She began establishing the Comet Line after she first worked in the Red Cross (ie, she didn’t scribble a V on a poster and hand out fliers and BAM, hiked Pyrenees). In contrast, Hannah gives Isabelle daddy issues, has her begin working for the rebels to impress a love interest, then has her die contentedly in her lover’s arms. What’s so astounding and disturbing is that all the things that Hannah changed about De Jongh, were the things that made De Jongh strong, powerful, resilient, caring, heroic.Then there is the writing style.The number of times that Hannah repeated the same mediocre turn of phrase had me feeling like she was just enamored with her own writing. Which was sad, because the oft-repeated turns of phrase were mediocre at best, rendered embarrassing after, oh, the fifth time. How many times does a car horn “aah-oo-gah”? How many times do characters note the black markings on the wall where pictures used to hang? Hint: one time too many. How many times is something “was all she could say”? (Seven times too many. Note to Hannah: if that’s all a character says, it goes without saying that that’s all she could say.) How many times do people “tent” their hands over their eyes? The French words peppering this novel were the most generic one word expressions (oui, merde) that felt like Hannah couldn't be bothered to consult a French editor so she stuck with the most basic words. Merde is not the go-to French cuss either. Nor is it especially not the ONLY French cuss word either.Similes that mix senses abound — “roses tumbling like laughter” is just ONE example. Clouds are stretched tight as clotheslines — it goes on. The result was, for me, a very cartoonish book with clothesline-hanger clouds (complete with clothes flapping), laughing roses, and a Roger Rabbit cameo every time a horn “aah-oo-gahs”. And, in fact, Hannah thought her little aah-oo-gah was so clever that she even turned it, in one instance, into a verb. Aah-oo-gahed. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried, you guys. Think that’s not so bad? In the middle of a detailed rape scene, we have, ladies and gents, He kicked the door shut with his booted foot and then shoved her up against the wall. She made an ooph as she hit. This is exactly the kind of sentimental, senseless, ridiculous, bullshit chick-lit writing that is PRECISELY why men make fun of chick-lit, and what basically sets feminism back about a leap year or three.Then there was what I can only describe as empty calorie description. The only flowers Hannah seems to know of are jasmines and roses. Every time there is a group of people, a baby wails and women cry/scream. Every. Bloody. Time.Vianne sat down beside Sophie. She thought about their old life—laughter, kisses, family suppers, Christmas mornings, lost baby teeth, first words. This is a generic description of motherhood that I, a non-mother, could have come up with. I could go on about the idyllic descriptions of France in WWII. All I’ll say is seriously, just pick up a vintage hat catalogue and French magazine and you’ve got the best of KH’s The Nightingale. We’re talking picnics with checkered blankets, brimmed hats, aprons, pencil skirts, berets. The book was a fashion show, really. The anachronisms were so bad too that it felt like watching a shoddily done play where the only thing historical is the fashion. (Expressions like “I’m pretty sure” and “bombed the hell out of” make appearances.)Am I being too harsh? I could just be a little pissed of still from the fucking bullshit that was the last two chapters of this trash book.SO this book is about two polar opposite sisters in Nazi-occupied France. Sounds brilliant! Except it has fuck all to do with sisters. It’s all romance. All the book does is romanticise war. You might be thinking, but come on, what’s wrong with adding romance in a war story?Honestly? NOTHING.So why am I complaining that this is “romanticized”? Because Hannah uses war and tragedy in SERVICE of a romance. It’s a backdrop, a pretty set, for a romance to play out, just like the 5,000,000,055 references to clothes, hats, and valises. Hannah even uses a real women , a real war hero, to service her love story.Is this book really about two sisters learning to love each other? I wish.Isabelle puts not just her sister but also her NIECE in jeopardy by bringing the downed airman into the barn. She escapes, Vianne stays behind. What happens when Isabelle receives a letter saying that Vianne has a new Nazi billeting with her? This: Vianne was fine—she had been released after questioning—but another soldier, or soldiers, was billeted there. She crumpled the paper and tossed it in the fire. She didn’t know whether to be relieved or more worried. Instinctively, her gaze sought out Gaetan, who was watching her as he spoke to an airman. And then a page of her unrequited love for Gaetan. That, you guys, is all the passing thought she gives to her sister. Have you guys heard this famous quote by Winnie the Pooh? “Always remember: you’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” Well, have you also heard the modernized tumblr version? It’s the same, but with “and twice as beautiful as you ever imagined.” That last addition is usually written in bigger text or italicized for emphasis. I’m going to quote someone else now who analyzed it first:
Why did girls feel like something was missing from that quote in its original form? … Because the message that we constantly receive is that girls are not valuable without beauty.
Brave, strong, and smart are NOT enough for women—they must be beautiful, too.Why is this related to The Nightingale? Because of THIS:1. “[Gaetan] won’t think I’m pretty anymore.”2. Vianne kissed [Isabelle’s] cheek. “You’re beautiful,” she said.3. When he drew back, he stared down at her and the love in her eyes burned away everything bad; it was just them again, Gaetan and Isabelle, somehow falling in love in a world at war. “You’re as beautiful as I remember,” he said.4. It didn’t matter that she was broken and ugly and sick. He loved her and she loved him.Then in the last chapter, Vianne:1. “I thought she was reckless and irresponsible and almost too beautiful to look at.”2. “Isabelle Rossignol died both a hero and a woman in love.”According to Hannah, it isn’t that Isabelle survived the concentration camps and is a war hero that matters. What matters is that she came back STILL BEAUTIFUL.Yes, I do realise that she was bald and had malnutrition, weighed eighty pounds, had typhus and pneumonia and was coughing blood. I do realise that Hannah was saying that, despite all that, she was beautiful. Which at face value seems like a terrific message to send out.But more important than her dying a war hero, was that she died a woman in love. Because that’s Vianne’s final thought, the final thing about her sister at the speech at the end. That she died a woman in love. Not, as Hannah tried to pretend, after seeing a free France and being part of the resistance. In the camp, Isabelle “had to stay alive long enough to see an Allied victory and a free France.” But she does see a free France... and still her life is not “enough.” In fact, she wanders out in the rain because “Gaetan promised to find me after the war was over ... I need to get to Paris so he can find me.” Her life becomes “enough” when Gaetan appears.Why isn’t it enough that Isabelle is a war hero? That she was brave? Smart? Strong? Here’s a radical feminist thought: why can’t we, as women, just leave beauty out of the equation entirely? Even if she was a pretty woman, why does it need to be mentioned? And at every page, too? Which brings me back to that Winnie the Pooh quote. For women, to be brave, strong, and smart, it is not enough.Because Isabelle was exactly all three of those things.And let me ask Hannah the same question she asked in the book.“You should take a break, maybe. Let someone else do your mountain trips.”[Isabelle] gave [her father] a pointed look. Did people say things like this to men? Women were integral to the Resistance. Why couldn’t men see that?Yeah, Hannah? Well, do people say “He died both a hero and a man in love”? I think not.Let it be enough that she was a war hero, please.",1.0

SUMMARY:
Claire is happily married. She and her husband are visiting Scotland and soaking up the history while indulging in some much needed time alone. One morning, they are witness to a group of women performing a ritual at a nearby stone circle.""They should have been ridiculous, and perhaps they were. A collection of women in bedsheets, many of them stout and far from agile, parading in circles on top of a hill. but the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call.(The modern witches at the stone circle...spooky and oh, such a good mood setter!!!)Claire returns to the circle later. I wonder if she felt called to that magical place, as if fate had plans for her and she was simply following her destiny.The tallest stone of the circle was cleft, with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces...""Without warning, and for no apparent reason, Claire is whisked back to the year 1743.I could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot, then disappeared altogether, leaving not darkness, but a bright void. I could say that I felt as though I were spinning or as though I were being pulled inside out. All these things are true, yet none of them conveys the sense I had of complete disruption, of being slammed very had against something that wasn't there.""There she meets James Fraser, a man who is as complex as their relationship turns out to be. Claire never stops trying to get back home, but this world of the past and her present is slowly beginning to sink into her. She must now decide between remaining faithful to a man she may never see again, or conceding to the realization that she will forever remain in this time, with this fascinating man who has become her fiercest protector. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~It's pure craziness to me how this book can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs. And it's both detrimental and beneficial that a summary simply cannot encompass the sheer scope of heart that is in these pages. I was absolutely unprepared.Why detrimental? Because the details did become tedious, even as they were adding to the story. The downtime...instead of a time of building anticipation, became a time of hurry up and wait. This is the only reason that I can't give this five stars...because, for a couple hundred pages, I was 'a wee bit' bored. And I hope that my saying this won't keep someone from reading it. I wish that I didn't have to mention it, but in order to be fair and honest, I feel like it's necessary, if only to keep someone's expectations from becoming too high. And to be totally confusing, it's the details that drag you down into the middle of the eighteenth century, the minor secondary plots that make you live this life for awhile. So I'm not certain that they weren't necessary. I do wish that we got more of Claire dealing with the mundane things, but she just never seems bothered enough with inconveniences to mention them.I don't want to do much of a character breakdown except for maybe the three big key players in this story. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Claire...

""You're no verra sensible, Sassenach, but I like ye fine.""
Oh boy. I had heard that a lot of people didn't like Claire at first. And to be quite honest, for most of the book I really DID like her. She was fairly steadfast to her husband...although circumstances bieng what they were, it would have been nearly impossible for her to stay that way. This was a fascinating look into what it must have been like for a woman back in those times. Not quite the Dark Ages but boy, they were a far cry from modern women's rights. This was a time of witch burnings and mob mentality. Imagine what it would be like to go back to these times, knowing what we know now, remembering what took place in history, and being scared to death to be female. You're completely at the mercy of the men you are with. Thank goodness Claire stumbled upon Jamie.Her character did fluctuate for me, for obvious reasons. I had a few minor hiccups with how wishy washy she was at times, and how little she seemed to think about how her actions would affect Jamie. However,  I do think that she had no idea how passionately Jamie felt for her until near the very end. So why would she feel the need to constantly spare his feelings and put him first?  At some point, she has to think of herself. The time frame in which all of this happens is not exactly conducive to accepting her fate and giving up on her whole life before Scotland. So I felt like I could cut her a break. She has an awful lot to deal with and I feel like she did the best she could. And toward the end...she becomes just as much a hero as Jamie does. You just have to wait for her to build up to this amazing person that she was meant to be. ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Jamie...
Yes, I swooned, I gushed, I loooooooved Jamie Fraser! Who wouldn't? Who would admit to it if they didn't? However, he is really not at all what I expected. I like the badass boys, the heroes, the heartbreakers, those men who make you wonder if they will ever be tamed. I like men on the edge of good and evil, the ones that you are always unsure of. But there's just something about the nice guy, the man who...as soon as you meet him, you know his heart is pure and good. There are no questions with regards to Jamie about his purity of character. He's the epitome of good. He's a great mix of beta male (somewhat in the background, not horribly outspoken, usually backup for the leaders) and alpha male (leader, loud and proud, tends to be bossy and pushy.) I expected Jamie to be a more stand out guy but honestly, it was all in the “knowing” of Jamie that made me fall for him. He is one of the most honorable, strong minded, tender, loyal and devoted fictional men I've ever, ever read about. As Jamie himself puts it, he ”I havena the taste for power at the cost of other men's blood.” All of these romance heroes that we read about...the Dukes and Lords and Lairds and such...all of the battles and death and heartache...they're entitled to their place in society, to revel in their own sense of power and self-righteousness. Jamie just wants peace, a home, his wife, and a good life. Simple but so powerful. If only more people felt that way, if only more men were heroes because of the battles they didn't fight.Claire tending to Jamie's shoulder...
""Ye need not be scairt of me,"" he said softly. ""Nor of anyone here, so long as I'm with ye.""
That is not to say that he was perfect. One big, huge point of contention for me was  when he beats Claire after she tries to find the stone circle and instead ends up getting captured. I don't care what year it is, That's never right. To beat her until she can't sleep, can't sit down, and then allow his men to make fun of her for days afterward while she is healing...this is one of the more cruel things that I've ever forgiven a hero for. I suppose if I'm going to forgive, it may as well be James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~
Randall...
I truly think that he is not only one of the most vile, heartless, disgusting, noxious, EVIL villains that I've ever met, he is also, oddly, an object of pity. Not to be mistaken for sympathy. He deserves a slow, torturous, endless agonizing death. His singleminded foxhunt of Jamie is confusing at first and later, every time his name is mentioned, I literally became filled with rage. I'm one of those that cried when I'm angry and I can't even tell you how hard I cried. Enough that I couldn't read any more. I had to calm down first. Poor Jamie :(  Here is my reaction, of which I typed in the buddy read I was taking part in after I read the specific part that made me hate...literally hate Randall. Do not read this if you don't want a huge spoiler. You've been warned!!82%  Son of a fucking bitch!!! Not only did Jamie get raped but we don't even get to see that evil, sadistic ass hole suffer? I'm so mad right now. So fucking mad. And what the hell was all the wolf bullshit? Why even put that in there? It has no bearing on the story except to draw out the part where Jamie is once again flogged...tortured, burned, beat, raped. So I say again...what the fuck? I'm a vindictive bitch. I want payback. That fucker needs to suffer. Jamie needs to look him in the eye while he guts him. How fucking anticlimactic to give him an easy out. I am just livid. I'm so pissed off I'm crying Yeah, suffice it to say that I really hope we get more of Randall and that Ms. Gabaldon feels the black rage that I felt toward him. I hope, I hope, I hope. Even rereading my reaction makes my blood pressure rise.
Final thoughts:
Yes, this is a great historical fiction novel but Jamie and Claire..their love, their devotion to each other is what makes this story epic. You just can't get around that fact. This is a love story. And so much more. I was so conflicted from the position that both Claire and Jaime were put in. What is right and wrong here? Claire loves her husband. But here she is, in this impossible situation, of which she can confide in no one. Not a single person. And so she goes first with her gut. Then with her head, and finally, FINALLY with her heart.""Does it ever stop, Claire? The wanting?"" ""You're mine, mo duinne,"" he said softly, pressing himself into my depths. ""Mine alone, now and forever. Mine, whether ye will it or no."" I pulled against his grip, and sucked in my breath with a faint ""ah"" as he pressed even deeper.""Aye, I mean to use ye hard, my Sassenach,"" he whispered. ""I want to own you, to possess you, body and soul."" I struggled slightly and he pressed me down, hammering me, a solid, inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke. ""I mean to make ye call me 'Master,"" Sassenach."" His soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes. ""I mean to make you mine.""and later...""Oh, aye, Sassenach...I am your master...and you're mine. Seems I canna possess your soul without losing my own.""With the gorgeous backdrop of Scotland, the descriptions alone, and the way the dialogue forces you to sink into the setting is worth the entire read. I'm beyond happy that I finally started this series. I'm trying to pace myself while reading the next stories, as I feel the greatness in ma bones. This book itself was so amazing, I can't imagine what's in store for me. There were a few hints...very, very tiny hints in this book of some strange happenings with regards to the time travel aspect. Things always get convoluted when it comes to the whole switching time thing. What came first, Claire in real time or Claire in 1743? What will she change by going back and messing around with her ancestors, or more so her husband's ancestors? I can't wait to find out.",4.0
364,The Help,,4.47,"['February', '10,', '2009']","I have this terrible, dreary feeling in my diaphragm area this morning, and I’m not positive what it’s about, but I blame some of it on this book, which I am not going to finish. I have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff, but the thing is that I do like stupid stuff sometimes, and I think it would be really boring to only like smart things. What I don’t like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don’t know. I can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally, all writers I'm pretty sure my angry friend loves. For example, The Lovely Bones, The Kite Runner, Water for Elephants, Memoirs of a Geisha, etc.). These are the books for which I have no patience, topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately, without exploiting the victimization of the characters. They’re books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can’t criticize. The Help is one of these.You’ve got this narrative telephone game in this book. The telephone game is pretty fun sometimes, and it is really beautiful in monster stories like Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest. All of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative. I don’t feel that way about the topic of The Help, though. In this book, a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the Civil Rights movement, who overhears the conversations of white women. It's an important topic, and I don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators.So, I can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids, but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they’re all speaking perfect English without a trace of an accent. It becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women, Celia Foote, whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable. Who is this narrator? Why does she choose not to speak proper English if she can speak it? Why does she choose to give proper English to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it? Also, usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book. In this case, it’s the author’s voice stabbing through the story. I am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking TV English, and the black women speaking in dialect. It gives away the game. Even the quotes from the movie have an example of this. A conversation between her and Minnie goes like this:Celia Foote: They don't like me because of what they think I did.Minny Jackson: They don't like you 'cause they think you white trash. Celia speaks in a proper sentence, but Minny misses the ""are"" in the second part of the sentence. Celia says ""because,"" but Minny says ""'cause."" If the reader were supposed to understand that Celia does not speak in dialect, that would make sense, but since it specifically states that she does, it doesn't make sense.To attempt to be clear, I didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect. I had a problem that the book said, ""This white woman speaks in an extreme dialect,"" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect. Aerin points out in message 111 that I am talking about eye dialect, which is about spelling, not pronunciation, as in the example above. Everyone, in real life, speaks in some form of non-standard English. Though I have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect, as Aerin points out, writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated, which often has racist overtones. If it troubles you that I'm saying this, and you would like to comment on this thread, you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say.I’m not finishing this one, and it’s not because I think people shouldn’t like it, but rather because I’m almost 100 pages in and I can see the end, and it’s failed to engage me. When a few IRL friends have asked what I thought of the book and I said I didn't care for it, they have told me that I am taking it too seriously, that it is just a silly, fluff book, not a serious study of Civil Rights. Again, I don’t have a problem with stupid books, but when it’s a stupid book disguised as an Important Work of Cultural History, all I want to do the whole time is tear its mask off. And a book about Civil Rights is always important cultural history to me. Anyway, the book becomes unpleasant; I become unpleasant; it’s bad news. If you loved this book, though, (or, really, even if you hated it) I would recommend Coming of Age in Mississippi. I think that book is one of the more important records of American history. Plus, it’s beautifully written, inspirational, and shocking. It's been years since I read it, so I might be giving it an undeserved halo, but I can’t say enough good things about it.INDEX OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS REVIEW""You should finish the book before you talk about it"": comment 150 (second paragraph); comments 198 and 199. “Stockett did experience the Civil Rights Era”: comment 154; comment 343.“The author of The Lovely Bones was raped”: comment 190.“The author of The Kite Runner is from Afghanistan”: comment 560.""Memoirs of a Geisha is accurate and not comparable to The Help"": comment 574.“Don’t be so critical!”: comment 475.“Have you written a bestseller?”: comment 515.“Fiction doesn’t have to be a history lesson”: comments 157 through 162.“Having grown up in the South during this era and having had a maid, I could relate to the emotional nuances of this book”: comments 222 and 223.""Minny and Aibileen are relatable"": comment 626“You are trying to silence authors”: comment 317 and comments 306 through 316.“Why do you want to read a Civil Rights book about racism and hatred?

365,The Pillars of the Earth,"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.",4.34,"['October', '1,', '1989']","I devour books. That is my euphemism for being so obsessed that I can't put them down and live my life until I finish them. For shorter books, that's generally not a problem, but for the 974 page Pillars of the Earth...well, let's just say we ran out of food, my children clung to my legs asking for food, and the floors did not get vacuumed for a good five days while I whittled away at this book.CLIFF HANGER: This book is not a cliff-hanger-at-the-end-of-every-chapter kind of book, which makes it easier to read it in multiple sittings. However, Follett does such a masterful job of character development, that I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next whether the end of the chapter contained a cliffhanger ending or not.CHARACTER DEV'T: Each character is so beautifully defined and fleshed out, that they become almost real. I felt that I knew them personally, that I could accurately predict how they would react in different situations. None of them were 100% good or bad, just like in real life. Some priests were holy, others evil; some were rich people with big hearts, others with small minds and evil intentions; some poor farmers were judgmental, w/narrow-minded attitudes, others opened their doors to strangers.PLOT/PACE: Foreshadowing was a very powerful convention that Follett skillfully weaved in and out of every chapter. It gave subtle hints, but never so overt as to suggest that the reader may be an imbecile. Backstories meander and come to closure at such a nice pace, that it always feels like something is happening and things are being resolved, for better or for worse.THEMES: My favorite theme was that natural consequences followed the actions of the characters. (I'm still a bit out of sorts after reading the deus-ex-machina-riddled Breaking Dawn, where all the natural consequences of three books worth of actions were completely erased-ugh.) There was a natural ebb and flow of triumph and misfortunes in Pillars of the Earth. Good things happened to bad people and bad things happened to good people, just like in real life. Follett does not try to save his characters from themselves, or from each other, and I enjoyed that very much.STRONG WOMEN: I absolutely adored the strong women in this book! What a joy to read about Aliena, carving out her own future after her world had been turned upside down! Life knocked her down plenty, but each time, she got up, made a plan, and triumphed eventually. Ellen, and Agnes in her own way, were also strong women. OVERALL IMPRESSION: As strange as it sounds, with all of the despair and misery that took place, the overarching take home for me, was HOPE. In the face of overwhelming adversity, these characters triumphed. The road was hard and the journey was long, but they CHOSE hope. They CHOSE faith. And in the end, that was all that mattered.Pillars of the Earth will be on my favorite books list for a very long time.",5.0
366,Memoirs of a Geisha,,4.15,"['January', '1,', '1997']","So.. Memoirs of a Geisha. I'd been wanting to read that one for a very long time. I had heard so many good things about it. It's supposed to be awesome, and deep, and beautiful, right? Wrong. It's not. The writing was what bothered me the most. It's pretentious and superficial, and sloooooww and it goes on and on and on and on and on and still, very little happens. In some sort of weird combination, the writing is both superficial and cliché. It feels like Golden thought it would be a good idea to emphasize all the Japan-and-nature clichés to the point of ridiculousness : I still can't believe how many times he compares something to the nature. Ironically, it doesn't feel natural at all. It feels forced and weird and and it's very annoying, as it slows down the pacing (which is already very slow) and frequently interrupts the narrator's flow of thoughts.  Examples? Yes, yes. Because I was so sick and tired of reading for the 40th time how something is LIKE a bird or a snake or whatever, I made a list. Enjoy, people. This is how Sayuri narrates the story. Please notice and enjoy how natural this way of thinking sounds : ""I felt as a dam must feel when it's holding back an entire river.""""I felt as sore as a rock must feel when the waterfall has pounded on it all day long.""""My poor scalp felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""And it goes on : ""Like water bugs kicking along the surface.""""Like the crisp skin of a grilled fish.""""Like a scrap of paper in the wind.""""Like ruts in the bark of a tree.""And on : ""Like a pig trying to survive in a slaughterhouse.""""Like a stray cat on the street without a master to feed it.""""My mind on the eve of my debut was like a garden in which the flowers have only begun to poke their faces up through the soil.""""It was like when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly.""""Out of my element as a pigeon in a nest of falcons.""""Felt as a simple smelt must feel when a silver salmon glides by.""Still not enough? I was hoping you'd say that. Here you go! : ""Like what a workman does to a field using a hoe felt the way clay must feel after the potter has scored it with a sharp stick.""""I felt as the waves of the ocean must feel when clouds have blocked the warmth of the sun.""""As if he were the wind that blew and I were just a cloud carried upon it.""""Like a tree and its roots, or like a shrine and the gate that stands before it.""""With as much difficulty as a hungry child turns away from a plate of food.""""I felt like a slab of tuna the grocer had just delivered.""""I was like a temple bell that resonates long after it has been struck.""""I tried to imagine I was simply a house standing in the rain with the water washing down the front of me.""""Like when a stone is dropped into a pond, the water continues quivering even after the stone has sunk to the bottom.""""Like the tree where the tiger might sharpen its claws.""""Like a fish belly-up on the stream.""""A tree may look as beautiful as ever; but when you notice the insects infesting it, and the tips of the branches that are brown from disease, even the trunk seems to lose some of its magnificence.""""As much a part of her as a song is part of a bird.""""Was as simple as a stone falling toward the ground.""""If you no longer have leaves, or bark, or roots, can you go on calling yourself a tree?""""Felt toward him just as an ice pick feels toward a block of ice.""""The two of them weren't ""spending time together"" any more than a squirrel is spending time with the insects that live in the same tree.""""Like the fisherman who hour after hour scoops out fish with his net.""""Like a mouse expecting sympathy from the snake.""""Like rice pouring from a torn sack.""""Expanding just like a river whose waters have begun to swell.""""I was like a child tiptoeing along a precipice overlooking the sea. And yet somehow I hadn't imagined a great wave might come and strike me there, and wash everything away.""""Like a snake that had spotted a mouse.""""Your eyes hang all over him like fur on a dog.""""I began to feel like a tree whose roots had at last broken into the rich, wet soil deep beneath the surface.""""Just as naturally as the leaves fall from the trees.""""Just as a stone must fall toward the earth.""""It was all like a stream that falls over rocky cliffs before it can reach the ocean.""""No more permanent than a wave rising on the ocean.""""Just like watery ink on paper.""  So yeah. Just because of that, it can't get more than 2 stars for me. It just can't. It's awful to read. And the characters. *SIGH* What can I say about them? Hatsumomo was just a big cliché, and so was Pumpkin, and so was The Chairman. They didn't feel real. None of them did. Sayuri on top. So I'm supposed to feel something for her, right? Relate to her somehow. That was impossible. I don't know why, but somehow I was able to relate to Chiyo - but not to Sayuri. Even though they're the same person, I couldn't bring myself to care for Sayuri. As soon as she ""grows up"" (even though she keeps telling her story with the skills of a freakin' 4 year old) so around the time when she becomes a geisha, that is, she becomes insufferable. And she has this sort of weird fascination for adult men, first M. Tanaka and after The Chairman, and it's just so annoying. Why does she like them? Why? And, yeah, she was also such a victim. She never made anything to change her condition, she was just this kind of submissive woman who, well, blinks and, I dunno, bows. I know it's the way she's supposed to behave, but still, it's infuriatingly boring to read about such a character. The only thing she ever does for herself is  sleeping with The Minister so she doesn't have to undergo Nabu-whathisname as a danna but even that is done in the purpose of eventually being with The Chairman. And who was he, that Chairman? Who was that man we hear about, again and again and again? What's he like? Have they ever had a real conversation? I don't think so. She idealizes him, she never sees him as who he really is, she just keeps wetting holding that stupid handkerchief every night and that annoyed me. It felt childish and weird. The only character I liked was Mameha, and she's the angel of the story, meaning that you're just supposed to like her because she's, well, perfect, kind, loyal and beautiful, the way Agnes is in David Copperfield or Melanie in Gone With The Wind.The informations about Geishas were nice, I suppose, but I don't know how much of it is true. The war was awfully, awfully boring, and very badly executed. I think you can see it was written by an American just by the way the United States are depicted. They atomically bombarded Japan and two of greatest its cities and yet, Sayuri doesn't even blink and say ""The American troups were very kind to us and gave candy to the children."" Er... Really?The plot dragged on and on, and I had to struggle to finish the book. The ending felt rushed. I hate, hate it when authors do that. He wrote a whole book about someone's life, and the final chapter is soo rushed and it goes like ""So that was forty years ago, now I'm seventy and I'm old and I'm gonna tell you what happened in my life between then and now in like, two sentences. So I married the guy I talked so much about, and then we went to live in the USA because that's like ZOMG the best country EVAR! And then he died, and.. Ah yes.. Did we have a kid? Oh, but wouldn't you like to know!.. Well you won't, cause I'm not telling you, neener- neener. Whatever I'm old, and I'm probably gonna die now LIKE A BIRD THAT FLIES AWAY"", because what would be the final sentence without a nature-related comparaison, huh? Right. I swear, the book probably deserves an award, for like Worst Ending Chapter Ever or something. It made no sense, it gave no real closure.Everything in this book was just so... flat. It tried to be epic and it tried to be a classic but it failed so badly. The characters weren't well fleshed-out, it was obvious that the Good people (Sayuri, Mahema) would triumph over the Bad (Hatsumomo), it was obvious that Sayuri would get her happy ending after all.. See, all throughout the book, I was completely disconnected, I didn't feel anything. I didn't smile, or laugh, I certainly didn't cry. I can't even say I'm angry or that I hate the book - because hatred requires that I care, and I don't. I'm just... indifferent. Bored. Unimpressed. And isn't it the worst state of mind you can possibly be in after you finish a book? Ultimately, it didn't leave a mark. So the book as a whole was a major disappointment and I'm glad it's over. I just hope the movie might be better - I kept thinking it would be better to watch it, seeing how graphic the descriptions were (of the kimonos, for example). [Edit: So I saw the movie.

When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the 
Outlander
 and

 kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!",5.0
368,The Song of Achilles,,4.33,"['September', '20,', '2011']","”We were like gods, at the dawning of the world, and our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other.”This book!!! 
Gosh I loved this book!!!
The moment I read the first page I was already certain of two things:1.)	This would become one of my all-time favourites and I’d gush about it like crazy.2.)	It wouldn’t only leave me devastated and heartbroken but also sobbing like a little child. Well, both of those things came true, even way earlier than I had initially anticipated. I was about 37% percent in (yes I looked it up! ;-P) when I first started to cry and it didn’t get any better after that. This book was just so beautiful! 
So, so damn beautiful!
 Madeline Miller definitely has a way with words and I loved how this story was written: Poetical with a lot of mythological facts and with so many details that it succeeded to make this a more than just intriguing journey. What I loved the most was how she managed to convey Achilles’ and Patroclus relationship though. Even though she never went into detail, never actually let them say that they loved each other; it was still palpable in every single moment they shared together. Those moments were so precious I couldn’t get enough of them and all I wanted was for them to be happy. Unfortunately I’m a little geek and know a lot about Greek mythology so yeah, I already knew how it would end before it even ended. Still, the sense of foreboding in this book!!! Oh gosh, it killed me!! All those little hints, those infinitesimal innuendos, those tiny insinuations, they piled up and up and up until all I was able to feel was dread!!! By the end of the book I was reduced to a sobbing and crying nervous wreck and the final sentence was like a dagger in my heart. In other words:This was exceptionally painful and utterly devastating, BUTit was also so damn good and worth every second of pain!The characters:
 This is my spoiler section in which I’m going to speak about the individual characters and what I thought of them. So you better beware and don’t read it if you still want to read the book. Heed my warning or get lost in the underworld. It’s your choice, choose wisely! ;-P
Achilles:’Ah.’ A sly smile spread across his face; he had always loved defiance. ‘Well, why should I kill him? He’s done nothing to me.’This sentence killed me when I first read it! Achilles, my beautiful, innocent and naïve boy!!! Jeez! I loved him so much! He was every bit the hero people believed him to be and most of the time he actually did the right thing. Well, most of the time. At the end of the book there happened a lot of things I didn’t agree with and the longer his conflict with Agamemnon lasted the more I dreaded the end! It made me so sad to see how much Achilles changed over the years and when the thing with Briseis happened my reaction was the same as Patroclus’! I mean I knew what Achilles did (I’m a geek remember?) but reading it the way Madeline Miller wrote it? Boy it destroyed me! There was this wonderful, perfect, righteous, honourable, intelligent, innocent and honest golden boy and then the war over Troy tainted him, transformed him and made him an entirely different person. The true tragedy about this all is that he never even wanted to take part in the war, he was more or less forced into it and I think looking at it in retrospective a life as a normal person would have been preferable to the one of a hero. I guess in the end Achilles saw it the same way and would have done everything in order to change his path. Even if it would have meant that he would have been forgotten and would have never become a legend… it would have been worth it. Patroclus would have been worth it…  *cries*”I stopped watching for ridicule, the scorpion’s tail hidden in his words. He said what he meant; he was puzzled if you did not. Some people might have mistaken this for simplicity. But is it not a sort of genius to cut always to the heart?””Your honour could be darkened by it.”“Then it is darkened.” His jaw shot forward, stubborn. “They are fools if they let my glory rise or fall on this.”“But Odysseus –“His eyes, green as spring leaves, met mine. “Patroclus. I have given enough to them. I will not give them this.””They grinned, loving every inch of their miraculous prince: his gleaming hair, his deadly hands, his nimble feet. They leaned towards him, like flowers to the sun, drinking in his lustre. It was as Odysseus had said: he had light enough to make heroes of them all.””It is not true. You left yourself today. And now you are returned.”His shoulders rise and fall on a long breath. “Do not say that,” he says, “until you have heard the rest of what I have done.”Patroclus:”I went to Peleus. I knelt before him on a wool rug, woven bright with purple. He started to speak, but I was too quick for him. One of my hands went to clasp his knees, the other reached upward, to seize his chin with my hand. The pose of supplication. It was a gesture I had seen many times, but had never made myself. I was under his protection now; he was bound to treat me fairly, by the law of the gods.‘Tell me where he is,’ I said.”I adored Patroclus! He was the best! He was wonderful and beautiful in his own way and I loved how faithful he was. That boy was one of the kindest and sweetest people I ever read about (tough competition for Lazlo Strange *lol*) and I was so happy Achilles saw this too. He realized that Patroclus is special and he encouraged him to speak his mind. It felt like Patroclus was Achilles’ conscience, intervening whenever his divine heritage showed. Without Patroclus Achilles path would have been dark and bloody but with him at his side he became the glorious figure we all know about. Patroclus was so much more than just a companion. He was a friend, a lover, a teacher, a conscience, a reminder and Achilles past, present and future! This boy was literally the embodiment of Achilles life and actions and the people around them were fools for not seeing their strong connection. Patroclus was everything that was good about Achilles, he brought out the best in him. Taught him compassion and love, he was an anchor and someone he could come home to! Speak to! Confide in! Once Patroclus was gone the relentless godly part of Achilles showed though and the rest of it is (bloody) history. T_T’Patroclus.’ It was the name my father had given me, hopefully but injudiciously, at my birth, and it tasted of bitterness on my tongue. ‘Honour of the father,’ it meant.”Perhaps she thought I was mocking her, flourishing my triumph. Perhaps she thought I hated her. She did not know that I almost asked him, a hundred times, to be a little kinder to her. You do not have to humiliate her so thoroughly, I thought. But it was not kindness he lacked, it was interest. His gaze passed over her as if she were not here.”’Willl you come with me?’ he asked.The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death. Yes, I whispered. Yes.”I do not know this man, I think. He is no one I have ever seen before. My rage towards him is hot as blood. I will never forgive him. I imagine tearing down our tent, smashing the lyre, stabbing myself in the stomach and bleeding to death. I want to see his face broken with grief and regret. I want to shatter the cold mask of stone that has slipped down over the boy I knew. He has given her to Agamemnon knowing what will happen.”Odysseus:”May I give you some advice? If you are truly his friend you will help him leave his soft heart behind. He’s going to Troy to kill men, not rescue them.” His dark eyes held me like swift-running current. “He is a weapon, a killer. Do not forget it. You can use a spear as a walking stick, but that will not change its nature.”Damn, how much I hated and liked that sneaky and cunning bastard!! I’m still very torn when it comes to him. On the one hand he gave sound advice and knew exactly what he did and on the other hand he forced Achilles on his destined path. If it wouldn’t have been for Odysseus he would have never gone to Troy and even though I agree with his sentiment that Achilles could save them all, I still disagree with the way he played him. Of all the countless men that manipulated young Achilles, Odysseus probably was the worst, hiding behind the mask of a friend but ultimately pursuing his own goals. Clever! Very clever indeed! Agamemnon:”Then you are a traitor to this army, and will be punished like one. Your war prizes are hostage, placed in my care until you offer your obedience and submission. Let us start with that girl. Briseis, is her name? She will do as a penance for the girl you have forced me to return.”I HATE AGAMEMNON!!! Fiercely!!! Such an unfair and dishonourable numpty!!! I hate him and all his actions! I mean what kind of father would trade his daughter away and then kill her?! His own flesh and blood! Gosh, I CAN’T EVEN WITH HIM!! I’m still so angry! Those moments at the end and the tense situation between Achilles and him had me at the edge of my seat and all I wanted to do was to scream at the injustice that took place in front of me!!! Such a stubborn and self-righteous fool!! He should have listened to Achilles but he was too proud to. *shakes head in disbelief* I. HATE. HIM!!! Enough said! Thetis:Another person that landed on my shit list! *lol* I really, really disliked her too! I mean I understand that she was Achilles mother and only wanted the best for her son, but it was more than just obvious that the best was Patroclus and I hated her for always trying to drive a wedge between them! Without Thetis half of their troubles wouldn’t have even existed and even though she kind of redeemed herself in the end I still don’t like her! Sorry Thet, but you’ll never get a thumbs-up from me! #SorryNotSorrryThe relationship:Achilles & Patroclus:”This morning he had leaped on to my bed and pressed his nose against mine. ‘Good morning,’ he’d said. I remembered the heat of him against my skin.”Ohh how sweet those two were! I loved their relationship! They were so gentle and adorable and no matter what happened and no matter how many obstacles were in their way they always managed to find back to each other! They had confidence in each other and they supported each other regardless of the consequences. Achilles and Patroclus had such an honest and beautiful relationship, I CAN’T EVEN!!!! THIS was the real deal!!! A connection so deep that no one could destroy it, a love so strong that it cast aside all obstacles, their trust so deep that they could talk about everything!!! Boy, I could gush about this relationship at eye level for eternity and still would never get tired of it! *lol* I just adore them so much! It was so sweet they couldn’t even be angry with each other and even though Patroclus wasn’t always happy with Achilles decisions, he still did his best to support him as best as he could, even if that meant that he had to go against his will. I think in the end their unconditional love for each other was the only thing that was able to break them and it eventually did. Jeez! How it did! *cries again* Achilles had no reason to kill Hector, no reason to fulfil the prophecy. Well, at least not until Hector took the only thing that mattered to him, the only thing he didn’t want to live without. Patroclus! *sobs* Hell! The way Achilles grieved!!! It broke my freaking heart!!! It was like a punch in the gut! I know first-hand how much this hurts, how painful it is to lose a person you love so much, and boy did it trigger my emotions. T_T I felt Achilles grief with him and it was so intense it left me crying and sobbing. They were so beautiful together… so, so, so damn beautiful. I can’t anymore… *weeps* ”I saw then how I had changed. I did not mind any more, that I lost when we raced and I lost when we swam out to the rocks and I lost when we tossed spears or skipped stones. For who can be ashamed to lose to such beauty? It was enough to watch him win, to see the soles of his feet flashing as they kicked up sand, or the rise and fall of his shoulders as he pulled through the salt. It was enough.””My pulse jumps, for no reason I can name. He has looked at me a thousand times, but there is something different in this gaze, an intensity I do not know. My mouth is dry, and I can hear the sound of my throat as I swallow.He watches me. It seems that he is waiting.””His eyes were unwavering, green flecked with gold. A certainty rose in me, lodged in my throat. I will never leave him. It will be this, always, for as long as he will let me.””Had she really thought I would not know him? I could recognize him by touch alone, by smell, I would know him blind, by the way his breaths came and his feet struck the earth. I would know him in death, at the end of the world.””You can’t.” He was sitting up now, leaning forward.“I can’t.”“I know. They never let you be famous and happy.” He lifted an eyebrow. “I’ll tell you a secret.”“Tell me.” I loved it when he was like this.“I’m going to be the first.” He took my palm and held it to him. “Swear it.”“Why me?”“Because you’re the reason. Swear it.”“I swear it,” I said, lost in the high colour of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.“I swear it,” he echoed.”There was more to say, but for once we did not say it. There would be other times for speaking, tonight and tomorrow and all the days after that. He let go of my hand.”All told this was one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. It caused me to cry, it made me angry, it made me smile and it touched me deeply. I’m a total mess after reading this and my emotions are still all over the place, to say I regret reading it would be one hell of a lie though.I rarely write this into my reviews but: If you haven’t read this, do it now!!! You won’t regret it! =)Last but not least I want to thank my Sweet Sugar Bun who dared to buddy read this book with me! Thank you for all the comments, messages and updates that made it bearable to read this book. I swear if you wouldn’t have discussed this with me I would have cried even more often than I already did. *lol* So yeah, thanks for that wonderful buddy read and for keeping my sanity intact. I really appreciate it! XD We definitely should go for another buddy read some time soon! I heard “Circe” is a nice book too! *lol* ;-PIn the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood, like a hundred golden urns pouring out the sun.”Artist credit: I really tried my best to track down the artist but all I could find out is that the picture was shared again and again on pinterest.

369,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE ON NETFLIX - A remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name.",4.19,"['July', '29,', '2008']","Dear Mary Ann Shaffer,I recently read your book 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. It brought a few questions to my mind.Juliet writes in one of her letters: ""Dear Sidney, What an inspired present you sent kit - red satin tap shoes covered with sequins"" Didn't Sidney know what present he had sent?If you had to resort to sentences like these to speak what you wanted to, didn't you realize that the letter format and your writing didn't go well together?Learning from your bad example, I will quit trying to be fancy, stop this letter here and write a regular review.A Reader.** Spoiler Alert **Novel written in epistolary format. Set in post WWII England.1946.Juliet is a 30-something writer living in London. (She is like this perfect human being who is universally loved. The only people who dislike even the smallest thing about her are the evil people). One day she receives a letter from a man living on Guernsey islands who found her address on a second hand book he had. Soon Juliet is exchanging letters with the members of Guernsey literary society and people talk about what books they like and why. Then suddenly everyone forgets about the books and Guernsey people start sharing their most intimate experiences from the time during the world war with Juliet, who is only a stranger. A few weeks later Juliet goes to the Guernsey islands to meet and interview these people. Of course everyone there just loves her (except the evil woman). She stays there for a few months and decides to adopt a four year old orphan girl she met there. The girl of course loves Juliet more than the people who have raised her. And then Juliet marries a pig farmer and settles down on the Guernsey islands.So much for the ridiculous plot. (I should have just known better, just look at the cheesy title.)It shouldn't be difficult for a decent writer to develop good characters when using a letter format, since each character gets his/her own voice. However, all the characters in this book seem to talk in exactly the same manner. Be it an accomplished writer from the city of London or farmers from a remote island, their letters sound just the same. Irrespective of whether the letters are being written to a close friend or to a complete stranger. Almost all of the characters have only a single trait. For some of the characters I can't recall even a single distinct characteristic.Mary Ann tries to have everything in one book. She has grazed the surface of numerous topics like books, world war, art, nature love, bucolic life, friendship, love, homosexuality, religion and so on. None of these get more than a superficial treatment. Stories about Nazi occupation of Guernsey don't tell you anything real about the war. They just revolve around this saint of a woman who died during the war while trying to show-off her heroism. To add to this drama, halfway through the book Mary Ann shifted the focus to Juliet trying to decide between different love interests (too many people love her, you know). Why is this book being marketed a historical novel?Another one of those recent successful books that everyone is raving about. I don't get it.",1.0
370,The Other Boleyn Girl,Two sisters competing for the greatest prize: The love of a king,4.08,"['April', '21,', '2001']","Some people (read: uptight history nerds with nothing better to do) like to get their undies in knots over Philippa Gregory's writing and whine about how she takes too many liberties with history. Well, guess what? She makes it interesting, and since her books are classified as fiction, I think she can be allowed that. Also, I consider myself a history nerd, especially when it comes to the Tudors, and I think Gregory's books are great. The stories surrounding Henry VIII are already really good; all Philippa Gregory did was add dialogue and sex scenes that your history teachers pretended never happened. I was also very grateful that she didn't attempt to garner sympathy for Anne Boleyn. I've read a couple novels about her where the author attempts to portray her as an innocent victim and it's just sad. The woman was a manipulative, conniving, intelligent, confident bitch, and The Other Boleyn Girl makes this very clear.Other books in Philippa Gregory's Tudor series that I read and enjoyed: The Virgin's Lover, The Queen's Fool, The Constant Princess, and The Boleyn Inheritance.",5.0
371,To Kill a Mockingbird,,4.26,"['July', '11,', '1960']","/// gentle reminder that this is not the time to read this book ///This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.And that really infiruates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve. Harper Lee's focus is purely white. While the white characters in this book are the subjects, who take action into their own hands, who suffer and make sacrifices, the Black characters in this book are objects. They have little to no agency. Things happen to them. They are harmless, defenseless, and just there – waiting for the white knight hero, Atticus Finch, to save them. This book is a disgrace in the face of the Black liberation movements that existed back in the day, and the solidarity within Black communities. Black people stood up for themselves and fought for their rights, and only due to their voices, their protests, their sit-ins, their marches, their demonstrations, their conferences, was racial segregation made unconstitutional in the United States.Black people, back then and now, know that Atticus Finch doesn't exist. And because no one put in better words than the one and only James Baldwin, I will quote a passage from one of his amazing interviews on the Dick Cavett Show in 1968. One could say that this is Baldwin's response to the cry of ""not all white people"": James Baldwin: I don't know what most white people in this country feel. But I can only conclude what they feel from the state of their institutions. I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black. That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation. [...] I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me - that doesn't matter - but I know I'm not [allowed] in their union. I don't know whether the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools we have to go to. Now, this is the evidence. You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.This right here is what I'm talking about. To Kill A Mockingbird plays into this idealism. Although the book touches on the horrors of racism in the Deep South, it’s a strangely comforting read. A terrible injustice is done, but at the end the status quo is reassuringly restored. The final message is that most (white) people are nice when you get to know them. As a reader you are never allowed to feel with Tom Robinson, the Black man who is innocently convicted for raping a white woman, because all the Black characters in this tale are sidelined. This story should be about them, because how else would you be able to convince the white moderate (in the 1960s) that Black people are actually people. The closest insight we get to a Black character is the family's cook Calpurnia. Calpurnia is in the fictional tradition of the ""happy black"", the contented slave – the descendent of the ever-loyal Mammy in Gone With the Wind. And the rest of the Black community is depicted as a group of simple, respectful folk – passive and helpless and all touchingly grateful to Atticus Finch – the white saviour. We never see any of them angry or upset. We never see the effect of Tom Robinson’s death on his family up close – we don't witness Helen, Tom's wife, grieving and Scout never wonders about his children. Their distress is kept at safe distance from the reader.I was very angry after finishing this book, and I'm still angry up to this day. Not necessarily at Harper Lee, but at our society as a whole, and at our educational system. Why do we constantly uplift white narratives, whilst brushing over marginalized ones? Why aren't our kids reading If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin – a book dealing with the exact same topic (a Black man getting falsely accused of raping a woman)? Why isn't Lorraine Hansberry required reading? Why are we still relying on white narratives, when talking about Black people and their struggles?Since finishing this book, I started reading The History of Legal Education in the United States and I wanted to share some interesting facts, because I couldn't believe how absurd To Kill A Mockingbird was. This story is, supposedly, set in the Deep South in the 1930s, where Atticus Finch, our white saviour, takes it upon himself to defend a Black man at court. By the end of Lee's novel we are led to believe that Atticus had a great chance of actually getting Tom Robinson acquitted, if the latter had just been a ""good n*gger"" and didn't try to escape on his own. (Yes, I'm a little petty. I swear, I'm not turning bitter over this.) So, I just wanted to know how realistic that scenario is. All of the information is related to the 1930s Southern setting. Here's what I've learned:Most Southern lawyers readily accepted Black clients for routine economic cases – property, tort, contract, dept, insurance – and minor criminal cases that did not threaten the South's system of racial hierarchy. It was virtually impossible, however, to find a Southern white lawyer who would accept a major criminal case involving a white victim or a politically charged case that in any way challenged segregation. Only the combination of direct action, community organizing and legal strategy with the help of Black lawyers, made the defense of Black men and women at court possible. In the Lockett-case, the Black community in Tulsa survived largely because Black lawyers were able to defend the community's interests. In 1934, Black lawyers represented George Crawford, a Black man accused of brutally murdering a wealthy white woman – no white lawyer would take Crawford's case. In the end, Crawford got a sentence of life imprisonment instead of a death sentence. And this verdict had to be seen as an accomplishment by the Black lawyers and the Black community as a whole, because life imprisonment was as good as it was going to get. Oftentimes, Black lawyers took serious criminal cases without a fee or at a very reduced rate. This was well appreciated by their communities, but also a given. It is admirable how well Black communities were organized. None of that got translated on the pages of Lee's novel. The Black characters do absolutely nothing, except sending Atticus food, because they're so grateful. [*insert snort here*]This book appears to uphold the standard of racial equality; de facto it is about the white middle class patting themselves on the back for not thinking racist thoughts. I'm sorry to break it to you, Miss Maudie, but you won't get a sugar cookie for that. I am not saying that this is not a realistic portrayal of the white middle class, it is, it totally is. If you do just a little research on the Civil Rights movement, the moral apathy of the white middle class becomes crystal clear. However, we shouldn't portray these characters in a positive light, there is nothing admirable about them. After all... He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against is really cooperating with it.- Martin Luther King, Jr.",1.0
372,A Gentleman in Moscow,"The mega-bestseller with more than 2 million readers—Now a Paramount+ with Showtime series starring Ewan McGregor as Count Alexander RostovFrom the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The Lincoln Highway and Rules of Civility, a beautifully transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel",4.33,"['September', '6,', '2016']","Tears were streaming down my face the last several pages. Turning each page slower - and slower - breathless - filled with gratitude- overwhelmed by what this rare book offers and then delivering a wonderful satisfying ending......to the already - rich- wonderful-absolutely marvelous novel. Goose bumps and butterfly fluttering.....the writing is pulsing with life. Amor Towles'sleading man....""Count Rostov"" ....[Alexander Ilyich Rostov]....or ""Sasha"", to a select few old friends, is THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL male character to come along in recent literature. I can't think of any other male character with the type of astounding dignity that 'Count Rostov' exhibits. I was either losing sleep reading this book, tossing out all other daytime plans to continue, reading....or I was obsessively thinking about this book when I wasn't reading it. My early thoughts were about Russia and the how the Bolsheviks came into power.....and the years that followed. Russia became symbolic of the spread of communism throughout the world.....resulting in the end of all aristocracy ----So....Not only was Rostov's aristocracy being stripped away, but his self expression and freedom of speech was being taken from his as well. He wrote poetry.....and a poem called ""Where Is It Now"".....[I thought about this interesting title for some time]. As in where does Court Rostov stand now? Rostov ""has succumbed irrevocably to the corruptions of his class"", according toThe People's Commissariat For Internal Affairs in Moscow 1922. I kept thinking - isn't it 'somewhat' an odd punishment to be given a life sentence of confinement to the walls inside a hotel? A grand hotel at that-- The Metropol Hotel. I mean ""Eloise"" .... in the Plaza Hotel in New York City was happy, but she was free to step outside. The Count's sentence is clear. Should he step outside the Hotel at any time, he will be shot-killed! I lost a few hours of my mind -- thinking 'only' about this. Why? What else were choices of punishment for an aristocrat if not killed? Did they have prisons? And - where was his money coming from? Was food included without him paying for it in the restaurants in the hotel? How on earth could he possibly earn money? Buy clothes? Essentials? - For the rest of his life? How will he spend his time - and keep sane? I was simply curious. And most -- how might I have behaved if I were in the counts situation? I'd like to think I might have stood tall- held my dignity - be the gentle woman - as Alexander was a GRAND GENTLEMAN. The Count was a fabulous human being....a man I would love to have shared a glass of wine with. He was classy - witty- wise - intelligent- charming and kind. There are endless likable characteristics about Alexander. He was generous with his soul. Count Rostov's days of writing poetry were behind him. He moved into a small room on the sixth floor in the attic. He was moved out of his luxury suite that he had lived in for four years in the past. Most of his 'valuable' books were back in Paris...but he kept one book that once belonged to his father -one he never had found time to read. ""The Essays of Montaigne"". He will finally have time to read Michael de Montaigne' essays now ---who was one of the most significant philosophers of the French renaissance known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. In the first few weeks of living in the Metropol Hotel-- Alexander holds himself high - has no interest in bitterness ---GOD I LOVED THIS MAN---and quietly stayed in his room, reading, and reflecting. He ate his meals in either of the two restaurants: the Boyarsky or the Piazza. Count Rostov being a wine and food connoisseur, is a treat for us readers - as the descriptions of the food and wine are mouthwatering-savory-and scrumptious. The way the tables were set -the waiters and chef add to delightful glory as well. I could smell and taste the fish, while visualizing the seating in the dining room. As for the conversations......Well....in steps nine year old Nina Kulikova. Too adorable for words -right off the bat!!!She's quite the conversationalist!!! She's living in the hotel with her father -and seems to have spare time for wandering. Their lovely friendship begins over lunch in the Piazza. Nina - of course - invites herself to Alexander's table by simply pulling up a chair, sitting down, and staring at his food. Their friendship continues when Nina manages to coerce Court Rostov into joining her in one of her many hidden excursions. SPYING into the secret passageways and locked rooms with the stolen key she has. So 'how' does a precocious nine-year-old coerce a grown man to sneak around a hotel with her? Nina says:""Oh come along"" ""I'd rather not"" ""Don't be such a fuddy-duddy"".  ""I'm not a fuddy-duddy"". ""Can you be so sure?"" ""A man can never be entirely sure that he is not a fuddy-duddy. That is axiomatic to the term"".  ""Exactly"". Off they go! One minute Nina is interested in knowing the rules of being a princess ( as when they first met in the restaurant), and the next moment she is enthralled by the assembly's energy and sense of purpose...( from when they are listening in on the Assemblies political discourse). Nina is a wonderful companion - and because of their spy games, Alexander was able to listen to other 'fuddy-duddy's' discuss political and social changes. Over the years - three decades at Hotel Metropol--Alexander makes many friends and acquaintances. His closest friends with the staff are: Andrey, maitre d' of the Boyarsky, Emile the Chef - Vasily the concierge and Marina the seamstress. His old friend from Imperial University in St. Petersburg comes to visit him. MikhailFyodorovich (Mishka), was in town to help plan the inaugural congress of RAPP. Such a lovely friendship these two men shared. The Count took pleasure in his old friends romantic skirmish; yet felt a sting of envy. Anna Urbanova a celebrity actress ....becomes a between-the-sheets friend. Other people come and go ---Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov is a former colonel of the Red Army- whom Alexander has many political conversations with.... and not only about Russia, but the rest of the world. They watch and discuss the movie Casablanca--- and the symbolism is achingly beautiful. Yet.....Out of all the people who come and go - it's Nina who has Alexander's heart the most.A time comes when she does leave the hotel - but then she comes back years later for a brief visit - a visit that will alter Alexanders life. Alexander Ilyich Rostov: somehow this man knew that life was never meant to be a struggle. If only I could learn from him. As The Count learned from his ancestors.....""If a man does not master his circumstances he is bound to be mastered by them"".A Masterpiece! One of the most phenomenal book books in 'years'. It's Nov. - almost Thanksgiving: I've read so many outstanding books this year it's ridiculously crazy-terrific. 2016 has been a year of favorite books....but ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" tops them all! Amor Towles delivered as a gift!",5.0
373,Pachinko,,4.33,"['February', '7,', '2017']","Just having finished this behemoth in the last hour, I want to put a disclaimer first. That reading this over a longer period of time than I would usually read a book, even of this length, probably made me MORE analytic than for my usual review. Or reaction. More critical. Because I truly wanted to give it a higher star value. I really did! But I cannot. So don't be scared away from reading it, because I am specific or amused for some of the tangents she took. Take it with a grain of salt. Especially if you are not the kind of reader that is bothered by vastly changing style of approach within one book. I am!The first third of this book is nearly a 5 star perfection for character development, place reality, era feel, and boding wars of surround. In cultural mix and clash, in politico straining for the working day existence in Korea (Busan) under Japanese governmental domination. Isak is a saint. His landlady and Sunja- they are sublime and so real. You know them as you have known a Scarlet O'Hara or a Dorothy in Kansas. I'll remember them. And those two married couples and their ultimate striving, movements and eventual Osaka, Japan bound lives. Leaving Korea and the death sentence that Christian belief insured. The world at war a mere background, but closer wars and constant work their every breath. And then the second third of the book. The boys' stories. Hansu, yes- but mainly the boys' years of their growing up in Osaka. The Japanese defeat years within Japan with their Korean ethnicity. This is clear and yet convoluted. Not linear and direct as the first part. But yet, it is 4 star in the friends of each, the characters of mentoring, the parents and the Aunties' core purposes. The differences of languages and custom and most of all- for association and work. It's a good wider tale, and well done, kept my interest. Which gives out eventually in this parsing for a wider look at Osaka and the upcoming Pachinko connections for family support. Just a game in a parlor! But in doing so, the epic length and detail for this family is becoming broader, although shallower- much like a river near its delta- it's becoming defused and silt laden. The pure core of clearness for the first Korean situation is getting more progressively lost.And then the last third of the book from the late 1960's onward to its conclusion! This is barely a 2.5 star read. It jumps. Relationship and context become abrupt. Many tangent issues of intersect to the story become sketchy. Is this new character or that one introduced to merely become an example for a group label or thesis issue? We find none of the individual character self-realizations or deep core connection coming from text connotation or the visuals (as went so beautifully within the first third of the book). But instead any clarity, if any, is coming from conversations of the bemoaning failure or nasty hanger on. Dialog becomes harsh. Style is jagged and changes abruptly as well. Description quickly becoming 10 pages of angst or venting conversation for a character who is then ""dealt out"" of the context or continuation of this plotting within a mere 3 lines somewhere in the next chapter? Huh!Whatever was the style causation for this last third of the book- it was a mistake. She had too much to say? The grandchildren's stories should have been a separate book. The great-grandson's with the ultimate Phoebe dichotomy QUESTION of vast location decision for identity of placement- the crux pivot. This decision on where to live FOR that identity of the individual- quite another whole book. That last would have made a great story if she would have followed the style of nuance and purity for those first 2 couples who lived within Busan and knew who they were. That one could have potential to be superb. Not added within 3 paragraphs, or as an afterthought for a partial closure.So- how do you judge this book? Not in 40 words, that's for sure.I enjoyed the first half much more than the last. But I did read every word and read this slowly. There was an absolute intrigue for me- to answer a question ""to or for"" myself about how these people would ""self-describe"". Are they Korean? Are they Japanese. They hold passports from South Korea, even those who have never been there. And getting Japanese citizenship? Well, you decide if that is a realistic possibility. Japanese want to be ""the same"" at their very cores- difference can and does equate to unmannerly and ""wrong"". As much as I did enjoy the factual minutia of these times and places, and the mix of modes and fads displayed by those who lived them. I also became quite aware that this essentially, in the last 50 or 60 pages of the book- holds a very anti-Japanese animus. Which became more and more openly revealed. I would say it is a prejudice, just as equal to the one the Japanese held for Noa.So I can only give it 3 stars. It's a tremendous effort. Places and characters here are often superbly detailed. Min Jin Lee just bit off far more than she could chew, IMHO. Trying to get every victim or condition ""label"" issued for a human being since the middle of the last century into some action or subplot was also not a wise move.",3.0
374,The Kite Runner,,4.34,"['May', '29,', '2003']","Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in ""backwardness"" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting. Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the ""wronged"" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again? Of course this elevation of / identification with the ""wounded""/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.) I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral ""triumph"", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it. Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:""Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her."" (p.178)""'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'"" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my review The Kite Runner in February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review of The Kite Runner. This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion. Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is ""It was OK;"" 1 star is ""I didn't like it."" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're ""supposed"" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Clara's Heart, Bagger Vance, or Ghost (all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired.",1.0

376,Expiration Dates,,3.75,"['March', '19,', '2024']","I usually have a lot to say about a book (shocking, I know), but this one left me a bit befuddled. Did I enjoy it? I think so. And yet, I wanted more than what I got.Daphne has an unusual quirk—every time she meets a new man, she gets a piece of paper with his name and the exact amount of time they will be together. Until one day, she gets a piece of paper with just a name: Jake. It seems all her waiting is over, and she has finally met the one. But as their relationship continues, Daphne starts to wonder what it means to be with someone she isn't entirely truthful with.With a premise like that, I was expecting something, well unexpected. To know the future before it happens is a double-edged sword. Do you forge your own destiny or do you let yourself be steered by what you know your destiny to be? Ah, a subtle but important distinction and a quandary to be certain. So I settled in for what is sure to be an interesting read.We follow Daphne as she meets Jake and their relationship grows. And through flashbacks, we see some of her other relationships in the past, including her three-month romance with her now best friend, Hugo. As time goes on, she can't help but be cynical as relationship after relationship ends, exactly as the papers predict.But then as the story continues, I started to realize that it isn't what I was expecting. Or rather, it is, but I thought there would be more. For such an fascinating premise, this seems more like a romance or women's fiction rather than the profound read I was hoping for.Yes, we do spend a little bit of time contemplating Daphne's unusual issue, but otherwise, this story unfolds along the same vein as any other fictional relationship. In fact, the story focuses a lot of time on another thing altogether, which while worthwhile, feels a bit like a bait-and-switch to me.It doesn't help that Daphne and Jake lacked chemistry together. They feel rather bland, so it was hard to invest in their relationship or to understand what they saw in each other. The only chemistry was between Daphne and Hugo, which made this a somewhat confusing read because I wasn't sure who to cheer for.But that isn't to sell the story short. There were definitely moments when it got ahold of me and I felt its emotional pull. And its message of living your life to the fullest because it's the only one you've got is a worthy one, even if it got a little muddled in the tale.So yes, I did enjoy this, even if it didn't end up being as profound as I'd hoped for. The undeniably fascinating premise and little nuggets of emotional moments left me with some interesting food for thought. For that, I'll round it up to 4 stars.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:In Five YearsOne Italian Summer~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧",4.0

379,The Other Side of Disappearing,"From the acclaimed author of Georgie, All Along and Love Lettering, a pitch-perfect, radiantly transporting love story about an unexpected road trip, true crime obsessions, and hard won vulnerability… Hairstylist Jess Greene has spent the last decade raising her younger half-sister, Tegan—and keeping a shocking secret. Ever since their reckless mother ran off with a boyfriend she’d known only a few months, Jess has been aware that he’s the same accomplished con man who was the subject of a wildly popular podcast, The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore. Now thirty-one, Jess didn’t bargain on Tegan eventually piecing together the connection for herself. But Tegan plans to do exactly what Jess has always feared—leave their safe, stable home to search for their mother—and she’ll be accompanied by the prying podcast host and her watchful, handsome producer, Adam Hawkins. Unwilling to let the sister she’s spent so much of her life protecting go it alone, Jess reluctantly joins them. Together, the four make their way across the country, unraveling the mystery of where the couple disappeared to and why. But soon Jess is discovering other things too. Like a renewed sense of vulnerability and curiosity, and a willingness to expand beyond the walls she’s so carefully built. And in Adam, she finds an unexpected connection she didn’t even know was missing, if only she can let go and let him in . . .",3.99,"['March', '26,', '2024']","Kate Clayborn has done it again, composing a symphony by playing the strings of readers' devoted hearts. This heartwarming, genuine, and inspirational story delves into the lives of people who disappear from our lives, taking parts of us with them and leaving us feeling like half-empty shelves.The narrative beautifully explores realistic dysfunctional family dynamics, sisterhood, self-discovery, and healing wounds, all blended into a poignant love story. The unique and complex bond between sisters is particularly moving, bringing forth torrents of emotion that had me shedding tears.Let's meet hairstylist Jess Greene, who hides behind thick emotional barriers, having no intention of letting anyone in. She harbors secrets about her mother, who left her and her stepsister Tegan ten years ago when Jess was only 8. This event shattered her trust in people, forcing her to live like a shell of herself. Jess becomes Tegan's guardian when their mother, Charlotte, is lured away by a conman named Lynton Baltimore. Despite sending five postcards to inform Jess about her journey, Charlotte shows no interest in hearing from her daughters.Although Jess never discusses the postcards with her sister, she discovers one day that Tegan has packed her bags without telling her. Tegan becomes enamored with Salem Durant, a popular podcaster whose show, ""The Last Con of Lynton Baltimore,"" becomes a viral sensation. Jess realizes that Salem is investigating the same conman who promised her a one-on-one interview that never materialized. The journey reveals that Tegan has been imitating Jess to join a road trip with Salem and his charismatic, giant, ex-NFL star journalist, Adam Hawkins, to follow the traces of their mother and her grifter boyfriend.Jess is startled by Tegan's betrayal but reluctantly agrees to join the road trip to protect her sister from the emotional crush she may have to face. Along the way, she slowly lets down her emotional barriers to allow Adam in. He demonstrates patience in earning her trust, revealing his own vulnerable parts and sharing his grief about a teammate who lost the battle against mental illness.The four of them traverse the country to unravel the mystery of the conman and his lover, the girls' mother. This journey becomes an inner exploration, forcing them to confront lost parts and fears that have prevented them from living their lives fully.Overall, this is an amazing self-exploration journey, a genuine sisterhood story, and a blossoming romance between Jess and Adam that warms the heart. Adam, with his cinnamon bun demeanor disguised under a giant facade, possesses all the qualities of the best book boyfriend. I recommend this book to anyone seeking something inspirational, soul-healing, and positive to lighten their mood.Many thanks to NetGalley and Kensington Books for sharing this lovely book's digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",4.0

My Thoughts:
Kilt Trip is easily one of my favorite books of 2024 and has officially been added to my 'Top 10 Rom-Coms of All Time' list. I absolutely LOVE this book and think if you like heartfelt romances that take place in an absolutely magical place, you will enjoy it too. There is so much about this story I loved . . .The Scottish setting. I love Scotland. I've been there three times in the past five years, I have a photo of a Highland Coo next to my bed, and I've cried many times over the fact I do not live there (yet). Let's just be real, my love for Scotland borders on obsession. There's just something about Scotland that calls to my heart. When I'm there, I feel like I’m home. Reading Kilt Trip made me feel like I was back in Scotland, and just for a few hours, I was able to once again lose myself in the beautiful streets of Edinburgh and the magical Highlands. But I was only able to get sucked into this story thanks to the phenomenal writing. Alexandra Kiley is a fantastic writer who, with her stunning prose and vivid descriptions, is able to make her readers feel like they have been transported inside the book and experience everything the characters do, like setting, romance, conflict, etc. Addie and Logan. They are realistic, well developed, and extremely lovable characters. Addie is a travel consultant who works non-stop and is afraid of love, while Logan runs his family's tour company and is afraid of change. They both struggle with loneliness and deal with some resentment towards family members: Addie with her dad for neglecting her after her mother's death, and Logan with his brothers for bailing on him when his new idea for the company flopped. I like that Addie and Logan are incredibly strong, yet tenderhearted. They don't want to let anyone down, but first they have to take care of themselves. I also really enjoyed the secondary characters - pretty much everyone at the office and Logan's family. The romance and spice. Logan and Addie have incredible chemistry and amazing banter, and the 'rivals to lovers' dynamic created such delicious tension. So when they FINALLY get together, it's explosive! Logan is a consent king and a giver, so LOVED that! And when he calls Addie 'Lass' . . . 🥵 I know the Scottish brogue I've been using in my head is nowhere near as sexy as Logan's, so I am excited for the audiobook! (UPDATE: I just listened to a snippet of it on Alexandra Kiley's Instagram and OMG I'M DYING!!!!! The male narrator does an incredible job!) There are four-ish open door sex scenes that are explicit but not overly graphic, and one closed door scene. The castle and office scenes. 😮‍💨 They live in my head rent free.The way Alexandra Kiley explored grief was beautiful. I really enjoy stories that go deep, and Kilt Trip does this with Addie, who struggles with the death of her mother. It's been years since she passed, but grief isn't something that disappears entirely, and being in a place that meant so much to her mother makes Addie feel closer to her but also bring up difficult feelings like those surrounding her father and his neglect after the fact. I liked how initially Addie was closed off about discussing this topic, but over time opens up to Logan, who is then very supportive. The side plot about finding the locations in Scotland where her mother took polaroid pictures was touching. 🫶 Learning more about Scotland's history and lore. Sharing this type of information can be boring if not done properly. But in Kilt Trip, Logan delivers this info usually during one of his tours, and he's a fantastic story teller. It was easy to imagine I was there on the tour since it was so engaging. Definitely didn't feel like there was any info dumping.Overall, Kilt Trip is a wonderful, genuine story that captivates you from the start. I'm very impressed with Alexandra Kiley and have added her to my auto-buy list. What a stunning debut novel. Bravo!Thank you Netgalley for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review! As always, all opinions are my own.

From the adorable cover and catchy title to its intriguing synopsis, I was immediately drawn into this captivating DEBUT rom-com! The story had me laughing, swooning and even shedding a few tears at times, thanks to the perfect blend of humor, romance and emotion. The combination of frenemies-to-lovers trope, pen-pals dynamic and dual points of view added depth to the narrative, while the slow burn romance kept me hooked to the very end. The passion, dark humor, tender and gut-wrenching moments made for a rollercoaster of emotions, and the chemistry between the main characters was undeniable. Plus, the incorporation of the cutest animals 🐶🐈ever and wonderful secondary characters added an extra layer of charm.

382,The Day Tripper,"The right guy, the right place, the wrong time.",3.75,"['March', '19,', '2024']","The story in this book starts in 1995 when Alex Dean is a young man who met the love of his life and has a bright future ahead of him. Or this is what he thinks. But after a fight and trauma to his head, he starts to live every day in a different year of his wrecked life. How could it happen that he had such a disaster in life and killed the woman he loved? And the most important is can he change something?The book is a bit slow at the beginning and is very confusing because it is hard to understand the story from such different points in Alex's life, but after a while, the reader gets used to it and we see the events that led to bad decisions. Later under Alex's actions the past and the future start changing and Alex becomes a different better version of himself.I read a few books about time travel and this one is good, in my opinion. It leaves us to wonder and analyze our own lives to decide that we made the best decisions in the course of it.",4.0

She is trained to be an assassin and goes through much abuse by the queen’s right hand. I found her to be an extremely likable and relatable heroine. She’s learning who she is as a woman and discovering herself. While also having to discover the truth because everyone is spinning a different tale. She’s strong, fierce, funny, but also vulnerable and wants to feel true love.Rogan is her childhood best friend and the prince who is betrothed to the princess. He always showed her kindness and as they grew older they fell in love with each other. But due to political reasons he did not choose her and this broke Fia. Do I dislike Rogan? Yes and no. He’s a product of his environment and has been fed lies distorting his beliefs. During their mission feelings com back and confuses the lines of their friendship. I believe he does love Fia in his own way but not all parts of her.Irian aka shadow daddy 🤪 is mysterious, dangerous, powerful and full of secrets. Something about a man that tries to kill you upon meeting is kind of hot ..talk about a meet-cute 🤭 I will fall hard for any morally gray character it’s a natural given..I’m hoping in the next book we get more information about him he’s an intriguing character. I loved their moments together he loves Fia fiercely and allows her to be herself.

385,Ellie Haycock Is Totally Normal,The Breakfast Club meets Five Feet Apart in this big-hearted novel from debut author Gretchen Schreiber.,3.68,"['March', '5,', '2024']","so first off thank you to netgalley for the digital e-arc of this book! I have many thoughts on this book… a lot good, some bad. I’ll start with what worked for me: 1. Her friends! Phenomenal friends, who showed up for her even when she didn’t want them to (minus Jack he makes me 🤢) 2. The general story. I grew up in a hospital, nearly five years on the endocrinology floor of a hospital. I could relate SO MUCH to a lot of this story. It felt like being sort of seen. I also like the ending where she isn’t like cured and done with her disabilities. That’s not how it works. 3. The characterization of doctors. Like for real, they aren’t always right and sometimes they treat lives as a science experiment. There was a bit too much doctor hate at one point. I don’t really respect people who say “all doctors are evil, stupid, and no good”… there are some AMAZING doctors out there, some who even saved my brother’s life. (That being said there were 1000% some crumby ones, I think this does a fair job of showing both sides). What didn’t work for me: 1. Ellie as a character was too jaded and frankly annoying. I can understand her frustration, I really can, but she is too hateful and angry for me to want to cheer for her. 2. Ellies “non hospital people can’t understand unless they themselves are under the needle” mantra was also not acceptable, and frankly just not true. As someone who has been in this position, you CAN get a group of non medical people to understand. Granted, a lot of people don’t understand, but some real ones do. 3. The romance… I didn’t feel it 🤷🏻‍♀️ 4. The mom/blog storyline. The mom just felt selfish and so did Ellie so I didn’t feel bad for either of them… Overall, I liked the story! But there was too much hatred/anger/selfishness for me to want to read this and get excited for a happy ending, or at least an ending.",3.0

With prodding from her best friend, she finally gets back out into the world and discovers a love for geocaching.*During a solo geocaching trip to Oregon, Wren meets Marshall Hendricks, a kind and handsome psychologist and fellow geocacher who comes to her rescue in a dangerous moment. When he suggests they team up on their quests for the week, she finally agrees. She doesn’t know that Marshall is also grieving a major loss. Perhaps fate has brought them together?As they get to know one another and Wren shares more about what’s happened to her, she finds a sympathetic and supportive friend in Marshall and a small spark of hope for the future. Unfortunately, the more she opens up and talks about her grief, the more Marshall seems to shut down about his. As they grow closer, will Marshall ever let his guard down about his past? Furthermore, can they realistically have a future together? I’ll just say that things get very complicated on the path to those answers, but I enjoyed their journey!This is my first read by Tracey Garvis Graves and it was such a touching and sweet story! It highlighted grief and healing in a way that felt genuine, which made me care for both Wren and Marshall. Their relationship was believable, and it was so refreshing to see two MCs with flaws and vulnerabilities. Their journey was messier, but also more relatable than a typical romance. I also liked that they were in their mid-thirties, which gave the story a welcome maturity.My one and only complaint is that the dialogue occasionally felt oddly formal and unnatural to how people actually talk. This has happened for me before in books by Isabelle Allende and Jodi Picoult, where the author has important ideas they want to share about certain topics - in this case grief - but it sounds like exposition on that topic being awkwardly forced into dialogue. Thankfully, MOST of the time that wasn’t the case - it just stood out when it was.All in all, I really liked this and would gladly read another book by this author! I recommend this to those who enjoy a gentle romance with emotional heft, and who don’t mind a little open-door spice!★★★★ Thanks to St. Martin’s Press, NetGalley and author Tracey Garvis Graves for this digital ARC to honestly review.

This third installment follows Meddy and her husband Nathan, who decide to join the Aunties, and Meddy's extended family in Jarkarta for Chinese New Year, after their European honeymoon. And of course, all hell breaks loose. I was hoping for character development and a plot line that was different from the first 2 books, and I got neither. It really felt like Sutanto was just dragging the story for the sake of making this series a trilogy. And just like in the first 2 books, the entire ""problem"" is solved within the last 2 chapters, which made it feel really rushed. I know I said this last time, but I am officially done with Jesse Q.

390,Funny Story,"A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common.",4.48,"['April', '23,', '2024']","2.5/5The review contains spoilers!What a forgettable, bland, boring and not Funny Story. This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me. I don't know if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, started their relationship — ""You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating."", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read, but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be that for me.As usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time she wasn't even close to how I could relate to January, who I'm starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just ""quiet okay"" about her if she hadn't moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn't that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn't so sure about it and who, speaking of which, let's get to him now. Miles Nowak, our Bridget Jones's Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him

""Miles looks up at me. “They,” I say, “suck.” “She’s the love of my life,” he says. “The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.""

The love of your life? Hell no. I didn't like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn't happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.Or when the question was asked ""if they would get back together with their exes"" and Daphne's answer was this

""Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back? “Definitely not,” I say aloud.""

and Miles’s that

""Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”

She cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean ""I don’t know.""?? It should have been ""No."" from the very beginning when you found out about it.The worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him. 

""And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried. I still care about her.” 

She cheated on you and then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??

""I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.""

And then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like ""Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then."". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.I don't even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.I never expected that reading Emily Henry's book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I'm in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily's book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card. ──────────Me at my graduation: 😐Me at my wedding: 😐Me when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰",2.0

— firstly, i’m the most indecisive person ever and i couldn’t settle on a rating for the life of me. i was so excited to read this story, like the gorgeous cover INSTANTLY drew me in and i was so stoked when i got approved for the arc but this book was just so boring and it ended up falling short for me.. i ended up skimming the last 20% bc i just wanted it to be over. i felt no connection between these characters. how was ford pining for rosie for decades but he hasn’t seen her in 10 years.. that’s why it all felt so forced to me, why didn’t he make his move earlier on if he “loved” her so much. he also kept having to repeat that he’s always pined for her ever since they were young. like who was he trying to convince that he’s always loved her, us or himself? bc i wasn’t buying it bc there is absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever. there was also no angst, tension or buildup + the will they/won’t they was so exhausting, it was going on for way too long and the bickering was kind of immature. ford and rosie are probably the most blandest couple i’ve read about in a while. **spoilers below**➳ ford grant:the most down bad man ever and a former geek who turned into a billionaire?? oh wait.. “worlds boring hottest billionaire” okay slay ig. i loved how shy and awkward he would get around rosie and how he wore her diary key around his neck but his character was so boring. idk if it was because he was written way too perfectly but his pov would put me to sleep 😭 it was pissing me off how he kept implying that he started from nothing even tho he is a nepo baby. i thought this was supposed to be a single dad romance but a 12 year old just randomly shows up at his front door and drops the “my dad died, my mom is now depressed.. oh, and i’m your daughter btw” card on him bc he donated sperm at 19 as he needed $100 for concert tickets. their first interaction was also ??? why are you saying to a 12 year old that you “never fucked morticia addams” and then she responds with: “what about a paper dixie cup?” she continues. “a petri dish? a sterile tube? you fuck any of those for a few bucks at any point in your life?” um sorry, what?? what 12 year old is talking like that lmaoo. the way it’s worded you would expect that from a 16 year old, not from a literal child. also why was everyone talking to cora like she was a grown adult. i also found it weird how her mother just handed her off to a literal stranger so easily.. it did kind of bug me that ford would refer to cora as his daughter bc she had her OWN family he was just a random sperm donor. you’re also trying to tell me that cora has no relatives?? NOT EVEN ONE?? lol anyways. i did admire cora and ford’s vulnerable moments, it was rly sweet to read about. she literally looks at him like he hung the moon and stars. ➳ rosalie belmont:idk what it was about her character but she just irked me so much. you know that feeling whenever someone talks and you just constantly want to roll your eyes bc they are pissing you off?? yeah that’s how i felt reading her pov. she literally has a bf but she strings him along for half of the book even though she has feelings for ford?? 🤡 like girl why are you still with that man when you both don’t even have feelings for each other and you both act like you are friends rather than romantic partners.. you could’ve easily dumped him when you moved back to rose hill. and then when she does finally break up with him and that man is literally in tears she says “i can tell he’s sad, but if I’m being honest, i’m not especially worried about ryan being okay. instead, i’m stressed by the fact that ford isn’t.” WHY IS FORD MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS SITUATION?? mans just got dumped and you’re more worried about ford just bc YOUR bf who you decided not to break up with shows up unannounced.. i can promise you fords’ feelings was not more important in this situation. was it rly necessary for rosie to be in a relationship? absolutely not, it was useless, they didn’t even speak to each other. she is also constantly referred to as “bitchy” and “bratty” and i feel like she just took that and ran with it.. girlypop being a bitch isn’t a personality trait and isn’t the serve you think it is. was this why she didn’t have any friends?? it was probably just me but i felt like she written to be like willa 2.0. even tho i didn’t connect w her character i did love her relationship with cora and that she was always there for her. the third act break up or third act drama bc idk wtf that was 90% into the book was completely unnecessary. was it thrown in for shock value?? who knows but it was absolutely ridiculous bc they made up so quick. i wish authors would stop doing that bc it just drags a book out when it should’ve been over. this was also a reason that detracted my overall enjoyment of this story. *regarding the sexual harassment, i wish it was touched on more!! rosie is sexually harassed by her previous boss who was in a position of power but then she starts a sexual relationship with ford who is also in a position of power since he’s her new boss. i wish they would’ve spoke about boundaries and what she’s comfortable with.. bc the first time they have sex she’s literally bent over a desk while at work. it kind of felt discomforting in a light of her previous harassment. there was also no personal development from rosie. rather than exploring her journey of healing, growth, or empowerment, the narrative seems to move on quickly, focusing more on her new relationship with ford. — this is a billionaire romance but he does absolutely nothing to showcase that he is a BILLIONAIRE.. no wait he attends one gala at the end and throws 100k at rosie like it was pocket change #goals 😍 im still confused on what his job actually was bc he barely even works and rosie just writes out spreadsheets for him once she is hired by him. what here screams “billionaire.” will i be reading the next book? of course, this being a complete miss for me won’t stop me from continuing on this series and wests’ character seems so fun. and he is an ACTUAL single dad so i can’t wait to read his book next!! i feel like i need to go and continue on with the chestnut springs series bc from the things i’ve heard i feel like i will enjoy that series sm more. thank you to bloom books for the arc───♡─────────────well this was a huge disappointment!! 😭 rtc —aaa i just got approved for the arc!! 🤭💓",2.0
392,Happy Place,A couple who broke up months ago make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.,4.01,"['April', '25,', '2023']","➸ 4.25 stars

”in every universe, it’s you for me. even if it’s not me for you.”

— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift. can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life! did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called “happy place” i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make you happy. the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm! — this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between a past and present timeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.

”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”

 — second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.— PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending. ↳ harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace, the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough* i also hate my job. her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.↳ wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters. ↳ 
wyn and harriet:
— i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. — i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹

“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”

↳ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was that friendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>> — overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!! — but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happy happy place release day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.",4.0

You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's not that bad!!"" i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want to look at this, let alone read it.here's what i liked:this scene - ""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously be SPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."" ). No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well. Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system is that broken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10. i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really said diversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!! 🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.",1.0

The hopeless way she said it made tears pinch from my eyes.""We're all a little broken, Briana. We are a mosaic. We're made up of all those we've met and all the things we've been through. there are parts of us that are colorful and dark and jagged and beautiful. And I love every piece of you. Even the ones you wish didn't exist.""WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ fake dating romance ✨ co-workers / doctors✨ anxious, cinnamon roll hero✨ depressed, kind heroine✨ both are recovering from a recent breakup/divorce ✨ exchanging letters✨ miscommunication✨ so much angst✨ dual POV ✨topics addressed: anxiety, depression, infidelity (cheating ex), divorce, miscarriage, family member with kidney failure This review is hard for me to write because the things I loved about the story make me want to give it a higher rating. But the things I disliked are what's making me leave it as is. I was full-on in love with this story for probably the first 50% to the point I was sure I'd be giving it 5-stars. But around the 50% and onward mark, I noticed things I didn't quite like.What I liked:Jacob. I loved everything about this man. He's so sweet, understanding, considerate, and caring. He's also incredibly self-aware and manages his anxiety in a healthy way. Jacob isn't perfect, but he tries his best to be. If he does something wrong, he'll try to fix it. If he's hurt someone, he'll apologize. He's so selfless he even donates his kidney to a stranger! He's also got a beautiful home, a sunroom filled with plants, and a three-legged dog! Where do they make men like him??? Jacob is one of the most loveable male characters I've ever come across while reading, and I want him to be happy in this fictional world. 💕 Brianna. What a firecracker! She is smart, fierce, fun, loyal, and kind. But she also has a secret crazy side where if you mess with her or the people she loves, she'll come for you! She cares so much for those around her (like Benny), even at her own expense. I absolutely adored Bri and laughed so hard when we found out exactly how she responded to her cheating husband. The letter exchanges at the beginning were so adorable! It's not something I've seen done very often in books, but it's such an interesting way for the characters to open up and be vulnerable with one another in a short amount of time. While Bri's letters tended to be more fun and entertaining, Jacob's letters were reflective and sincere. The exchanges were a sweet way for the characters to get to know one another while establishing trust. Bri and Jacob's romance. The love these two have is the soulmate kind. They were drawn to each other and perfectly fit in a way most people can only dream of. There was so much respect, understanding, patience, love, and passion way before things even progressed physically, so you know what they have is the real deal. I really enjoyed watching them grow together and help each other work through their own issues. The depth of this story. I was expecting more of a fun, sexy vibe like in Part Of Your World, and while this did have light-hearted, entertaining moments, it was a lot more serious and dealt with some heavy topics. Anxiety is the main focus since Jacob struggles with this, and I think Abby Jimenez did a great job showcasing what it's like to have anxiety and the challenges of managing it. The book also talks about depression, infidelity, divorce, miscarriage, and a family member with kidney failure. None of these topics are easy to discuss, but I think Abby Jimenez did a fairly decent job with them. I do think there may have been so much going on that certain topics were overlooked and quickly wrapped up in the end, but it did work with the story. What I didn't like:How Jacob's anxiety somehow isn't as present once he starts spending time with Bri. As someone who struggles with anxiety, it is true that there are some people who can help calm the anxiety. However, the fact Jacob claims to basically have little to no anxiety around Bri (at least when he's not stressing about liking her) is so ridiculous and far-fetched. I think it feeds into the unhealthy belief that being with someone can 'fix your problems'. There are too many tropes. You've got workplace romance, rivals to lovers, recovering from a breakup, fake dating, stuck together, one-bed, MISCOMMUNICATION, soul mates and I can't even say the last one without spoiling something major. But as you can see, there are quite a few. And while they all worked together, it just made the story unnecessarily complicated. The slow-burn romance was soooooo slow and was sprinkled with so much MISCOMMUNICATION that it caused too much unnecessary angst. Throughout the story, Brianna and Jacob do things for each other that are obviously actions of love, and both have inner monologues about how they are falling in love with the other, but because of miscommunication, they can't fathom the other person could reciprocate their feelings. These two were a ticking time bomb that finally exploded at the 85% mark when they FINALLY showed romantic feelings for each other by having sex. But soon after, Brianna withdraws, and the angst resumes. While I love their love for one another, watching their relationship evolve was not an enjoyable experience. PS: There's one sex scene, and it's very abrupt. After making us wait so long for them to get together, I wanted this moment to be drawn out, but it wasn't. So if you are looking for a spicy read, this ain't it. The inner monologues became incredibly repetitive. I noticed this a little in Part OF Your World and I'd found myself skimming a few sentences. But this happened so frequently in Yours Truly, that I skimmed paragraphs. There were a lot of deep thoughts, which are obviously important, but it felt like the characters were beating a dead horse by talking about the same things over and over again. No matter what, Amy is and will always be an unlikeable character. From how she's described, she seems to have narcissistic tendencies and needs to learn empathy. At first, we're supposed to dislike Amy and who wouldn't? From how Jacob describes her (based on how she treated him during their relationship), she is self-centered, selfish, and unaware of how her actions affect others. But halfway through the story, the author tries to shift our perspective of her and justify why she left Jacob and ended up dating his brother. Look, I don't really enjoy stories where the ex ends up dating the main character's friend or sibling. It just creates drama that makes me feel extremely icky. But she treated Jacob so poorly and never really apologized for how she overlooked his anxiety during the relationship or for dating his brother 3 months after the breakup. I just can't forgive that. Even Jacob tells Bri that Amy is a 'my way or the highway' type of person while his brother is so 'go with the flow' that they will be a good match. I just . . . no. Amy is inconsiderate of others and is in no way ready to be in a relationship - even if his brother is fine with a partner who will walk all over him. By the end of the book, we're supposed to understand and accept Amy but I just couldn't. Thank you, NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review. As always, all opinions are my own.",3.0
395,House of Flame and Shadow,,4.23,"['January', '30,', '2024']","3.5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫It feels surreal to have finally read a book I've been anticipating for two years and I am a sobbing mess after finishing the HOFAS. I'm already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers from House of Flame and Shadow so if you haven't finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce's story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven't rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I'm very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It's fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let's begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF's ending and HOFAS events is approximately 3 months (Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it's June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5⭐️ for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5⭐️. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don't know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don't know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).""[...] that wasn't there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern."" Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He'll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I'm glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia's daughters). It's almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can't wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5! The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I'm glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book. I wasn't rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would've tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn't clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn't have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on to Crescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she's coming off too much self-absorbed.It's hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar's rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She's not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I'm always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don't want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole ""our love spans across time and universes"" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia's chapters. Lidia's chapters especially are just *chef's kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with are Ithan's and Tharion's chapters. I'm sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few moments.I'm happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn't all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry. Tharion's chapters didn't get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It's painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It's like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn't expect Flynn's sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female's POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I'm a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I'll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can't help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt's father is, let's just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I'll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it's Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn't like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead. I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn't as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I'm glad they're gone but I don't know... it was too easy. I don't think it even took 50 pages to off them. I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would've been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I'm glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I'm getting bored of it because she did it too many times it wouldn't feel as impactful as it intends to be because its been done too many times across all her series.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter. Some of it didn't flow well and it felt abrupt while reading it. To me I don't think Sarah is weak when it comes to multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn't have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy the book but this is the book that made Sarah's weaknesses as an author more apparent, and she took a big risk with the crossover. Sarah excels at character arcs and healing journeys, but we barely had character build-up and she squeezed in too many plots in one book that was was overwhelming for me as a reader.Though will say I'm left with questions like:• What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?• What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?• What's the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?• Did we just forget about Viktoria?• Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it's a male?Don't let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you'll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah's books.I'm also so pumped for ACOTAR5 we're finally in its era after 3 years!!I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they’d made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies. Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I'm forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us ❤️ but please take the valid criticism surrounding this book into consideration and there are continuity errors and inconsistencies that the author and her editorial should reflect on. Sarah's editor: ""now this is a Sarah J. Maas book!"" *after SJM handed her the new draft of HOFAS*Me: sorry it pains me to say this but it's not and if this was SJM editor's response to her for a book littered with issues then maybe it's about time she hires a new one. Sarah is not a perfect writer but she has a way to make us addicted to her books. This is the lowest rated Crescent City book in the series and let alone the fact that it's a FINALE readers waited two years for! the question you should be asking is why. HOEAB and HOSAB were a Sarah J. Maas book, I wanted to reread them as soon as I finished. HOFAS was an ambitious project that I did find enjoyable parts of (and emotional), I miss the characters but I don't feel the urge to even pick it up for a reread anytime soon.I made a poll asking readers which Crescent City book is their favorite and these were the results from 1818 participants on bookstagram:1st place: House of Earth and Blood (61% = 1113)2nd place: House of Sky and Breath (32% = 580)3rd place: House of Flame and Shadow (7% = 125)If this doesn't raise any red flags, I don't know what will.",3.0
396,Beach Read,A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.,4.01,"['May', '19,', '2020']","This is my favorite romance read of the year. It came at the second place throughout the voting on goodreads choice awards. But my thoughts haven’t changed! I loved it so so so much!💞💞💞💞OH MYYYYY GOODNESSSSSS! Finally literature gods heard my prayers that I’ve been requesting to read a fantastic romance that I’ve been craving for so long! I need something heart wrenching, shaking me to the core, help me feel everything at the same time: happiness, angst, joy, forgiveness, enjoyment, resentment, hurting! Yes, I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I want to scream it! Oh, thankfully I already did! I have to add that: This is not beach read. This is GLUED READ. You don’t want to end it and you don’t want to stop reading it so you carry your book at everywhere as if it’s one of your internal organs.  I expected to read something more chic lit, soft, sweet story but instead of that, I got an amazing fiction, a remarkable romance juggles between so many things at the same time from friendship, regrets, cancer, betrayal, dysfunctional families and their secrets, enemies to friends and friends to lovers, rivalry between the authors!The things I loved mostly:-Sarcastic but so smart, entertaining, unique dialogues between January and Gus-The soul crushing, tear jerker, heart shattering, intense father and daughter relationship-Captivating the story telling from the beginning: I couldn’t put down this book. I actually devour the pages (maybe I accidentally licked my kindle but its screen looks dustless and I’m the grossest person right now!), I couldn’t stop reading January and Gus’ growing attraction, their struggles to open up and their scares not to get hurt, their stupid and childish actions towards each other. Yes I had some many “awww” and sighing moments. My husband thought I was secretly ordering cases of French wines because I smiled so much and I got appointment from the surgeon because it glued to my face and I’m looking like worse version of Joker right now! I cannot stop!-A witty plot: Two writers were nemesis from college now neighboring beach houses. They both have their deadlines for their books but they’re suffering from writer’s big bold scary blog! (Did it ever happen to me? Nope, after drinking, words pour out from my mind like torrent but next day editing them when you are sober is the most painful experience!) Gus thinks that HEA doesn’t exist but he can push himself to write about it and January could also write some high rated, complex fiction instead of swoony romances! So they bet and replace their places but for inspiration to do that they have to spend time together by experiencing the shiny and dark sides of the life. That means January will take him to carnival, romantic beach and field trips to watch the sunset as Gus takes him to hike at the graveyard or arrange an interview with a grieving woman who lost her death cult member sister. See, it was impossible not to get interested and hooked from the beginning!-Characterization: January and Gus seems like polar opposites. One pessimist who had problematic childhood with his abusive father and one optimist Pollyanna who loves to see from the brighter side even though her childhood was affected by her mother’s big C hanging over her head like the Sword of Damocles. They are suffering from loneliness and their wrong choices about their love lives. Actually they have so much in common and don’t forget THE SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and UNDENIABLY GROWING ATTRACTION!LAST PARTS OF THE BOOK: Oh boy! Please prepare your napkins, paper towels, anything to dry your non-stop dripping tears! I’m not giving spoiler but Ms. Henry is an emotional torturer knows exactly how to sing to our hearts, how to break into pieces and magically gathers each pieces and heals you with soul brushing, poignant words. She is a heart whisperer. She knows how to melt your heart!OVERALL: This is not only one of my favorite books of this year but it is also gonna be my all-time favorite romance books! I’m so happy my great written romantic fiction craving is over!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this year’s one of the best books’ ARC COPY with me in exchange my honest review.

397,House of Earth and Blood,,4.49,"['March', '3,', '2020']","Excuse me while I borrow a phrase from Fynn to convey my very sophisticated language while reading this monster of a book: what the fucking fuck.
Memento Mori.Remember that you will die.
Reading HoEaB is like listening to rock (maybe goth, punk, or alternative) mixed with trap: slightly jarring and odd with a hard edge, dark vibe, and pacing that goes from low to explosions and thunder. Which is something I love but you might not. No, this was not perfect. And yes, it fell shorter than the revolutionary it could’ve been. Nonetheless, it was a unique masterpiece to me because, of all of SJM’s works, this is the most surreal yet real, casual yet grand, the grittiest and most intriguing.With a more mature storytelling and a painstakingly-crafted, cruel world in defiance of the fairytal-ish-ness of ACoTaR, House of Earth and Blood sets itself apart from her earlier works, bringing in a detailed urban/high fantasy and noir atmosphere of mystery, drugs, sex, war, and epicness all in one book, with a refreshing twist on the Chosen One trope while exploring the power of sacrifice and unflinching trust in love.
Light it up, bitch.
To be frank with you, this sagacious mammoth of a book is more like an entire series, taking you through a journey so long and eventually satisfying with so much character development that one might say it is too long. And perhaps I first agreed until I realised that I wouldn’t give up a single syllable and lose the characters and world.Yes, it’s very slow for the first half but, when slow is interesting, it ends up paying off even better than fast paced as all those tied up threads snap in the longest, most exquisite climax to have graced my book shelves. HoEaB has about 200 pages of reveals and beautiful, glorious, touching battles, which is probably 4 times as many as any book. I think it deserves a break for having only twice as much a slow paced trying-to-unravel-a-baffling-murder-mystery tale.
Through love, all is possible.
In the end, for someone who doesn’t believe in love and will in all likelihood never be capable of feeling it towards any human being, Crescent City had me weeping and laughing and clapping and being filled with sheer blinding dread while sobbing at the above quote, all within mere paragraphs of one another. Yes, it’s cheesy, but it’s brave and iconic and I appreciated it?I have one very vital question tho: if this was the 1st book, WHAT CRUSHING EPIC HEL IS GONNA BE THE REST? (look for my playlist at the end of the review to enhance your reading experience even more!)↳ CW ➯ explicit language, drug use, graphic mature content, slavery, abuse, gore, violence, mutilation, speciesism (magical species over mortals), death, loss of loved ones, depression, suicide attempt (mentioned)↳ 
⋆☽ Storyline ☾⋆
Three realms make up the capital of the Valbara territory: the mer in the river, the Reapers and the dead upon the misty shores of the Bone Quarter, and the residents of Lunathion proper—all ruled by the seven Heads of the Crescent City aka seven powerful rulers from different species except, ofc, humans, because you bet humans have no power. Which would explain the Ophion rebellion of humans now armed with guns and bombs, currently creating scenes of massacre in the planet’s capital.
“Magic and machines. Never a good mix.”
Bryce Quinlan, a powerless and completely ordinary half-breed shunned from both sides of society and content to lose herself in her high-on-drugs-and-sex-and-youth lifestyle as a sorceress’s assistant, wants nothing to do with their antics.Until the leader of the rebels in the city gets released, and then...you know how it goes: people Bryce loves die, the government quickly apprehends the bastard, and all is good.Fast forward two years, the city rebels have shut the Hel up but people are, again, dying in precisely the same gruesome way—chopped into pieces. Could it be that the rebels were not responsible for the deaths two years ago? Then, could someone please explain to me, what the shit is going on?Thankfully, that’s exactly what Bryce, with the help of Hunt Athalar—a once-upon-a-time rebel angel enslaved to the very regime he hoped to overthrow 200 years ago—is assigned to find out. And you bet your arse nothing is as it seems.↳ 
⋆☽ Storytelling ☾⋆
Allow me to introduce you to Sarah’s best writing wrapped up in one book.I could tell you about the devouring, addictive atmosphere building that captures the urban fantasy mashed up with high fantasy and noir world brilliantly, making use of modernised naming, casual expression-and-slang-filled conversations, deftly written descriptions of drug-addled minds, and generally diving into real and gritty notes on the world—from flashing banners to the inane TV shows.Or, I could tell you about her no-nonsense storytelling that as usual doesn’t shy away from any part of life—be it a female’s cramps or sex or annoying behaviours in the bedroom or depression or cursing (which you’ll never hear me complaining about) and how considerate she is of everything including qualifications of medical experimentations.I could even tell you about her easy way with words that paints images straightforward while bursting with the occasional apt turn of phrase, staying more mature than her previous works without any overly poetic and dramatic passages constantly popping up yet still expertly trapping yours and the characters’ emotions to do with them as she wishes.But I won’t.↳ 
⋆☽ Characters ☾⋆

“Everyone, General, is for sale. You just have to figure out the asking price.”
★ 
Bryce
 is one of the most unlikely MCs, starting from a place of abandon and looking to find her worth, having a real chip on her shoulder when it comes to males and getting riled up rather quickly (while sometimes even unprovoked) about feministic matters, being denied a dancing career because of her body type, this curvy party girl brings a more ignored type of characters into the spotlight. With her, SJM comfortably shoulders themes like casual sex and drugs, handling them with such rare ease.
“I was told my half-human body was too clunky. I was also told that my boobs were too big, and my ass could be used as an aerialport landing pad.”
What surprises me most is that, despite her being a self sacrificing idiot, I grew to adore her. She’s not the stereotypical bore of a brave hero, she’s smart, real, tangible, messed up, and full of flaws. I realise this is Sarah’s preference in leading characters, as is dealing with loss and trauma, apparently. But I’m not complaining because her exploration of these subjects grows with each series, adding something different, something similar—all complementing eachother.
“No one gets a medal for suffering the most, you know,”
✯ 
Hunt
 the Haunted Boy bore such utter loss and loneliness that I couldn’t not like him. I appreciate that he respected her despite being an occasional idiot yet loyal puppy, but he lacked a certain solidity to his character that all of Maas’s other male characters still had. Such a shame.
“I have no idea what to do.”“I’m two hundred thirty-three years old, and I’m still figuring it out.”
✮ Danika, reckless, wild, loyal unto death, awe-inspiring alpha with a life forced upon her and the usual choice for lead; Ruhn, my precious defiant crown prince and Chosen One of the Fae, but a brother above all else; contained and messed up 
Fury
; unwavering June; unforgettable and priceless Lele; 
Flynn
 and his reflection of the responsibility-fleeing youth; charming Tharion;  humble Isaiah; and mysterious and dark 
Aidas
 I need more of...all own a piece of my heart now.
“You told me not to let them see me cry. I took the advice to heart.”
↳ 
⋆☽ Relationships ☾⋆
✰ 
Friendship:
 Danika and Bryce’s bond is probably one of the most beautiful things SJM has written. The sisterly support, the unwavering loyalty, the faith...it just leaps out of the page and grabs you by the throat until you are choking and crying begging for it to stop. I have no words as I’m still choking on those ruthless sobs.Truth be told, Sarah’s focus on the significance of friendship (even in a romance) above all else and her masterful tackling of its muddy waters is the best thing about all her works.
“That’s the point of it, Bryce. Of life. To live, to love, knowing that it might all vanish tomorrow. It makes everything that much more precious.”
✰ 
Romance:
 What I love most about this facet of the story is its focus on everything NOT toxic masculinity, and while I disagree that her previous works dwelled in this area (as the focal point of all her endgame romances have been friendship, equality, and mutual understanding and respect) we have had characters who’ve been tolerant of the much more animalistic instincts of the Fae as well as ones who battled those instincts and all but declared that it’s important to respect your partner’s wishes rather than act possessively; here, she takes the last step to declare it and shows that she can write different dynamics with adding Bryce, who isn’t tolerant of it.Yes, Bryce and Hunt might not be my fave ship, might not be a heartthrob, but not every ship has to own my heart. What matters is how they fit and how precious their bond is. Though TBH I prefer it as friendship.✰ 
Mother-Daughter:
 A gem of pure strength. My icy heart melted.✰ 
Brother-Sister:
 Having to deal with two older brothers who I can’t call overbearing or annoying as, honestly, I’m the unbearable one they have to bear with, I always crave these relationships in books (and hate how uncommon they are in works of fantasy). Well, my prayers have been answered! Can I have more of this preciously and precisely captured dynamic, please?↳ 
⋆☽ Worldbuilding ☾⋆


What word can I use to convey my adoration for this world? Inventive? Fascinating? Layered? House of Earth and Blood (which is also the name of one of the 4 Houses of Midgard, if you’re wondering) takes on inequality in a brutal regime while combining magic and technology in a dazzling manner—with scientists, tourists, blood tests checking one’s power, a system to monitor the vibrations in the world’s magic, and a sword in a cave (Jumong + Arthur much?), SJM has thoughtfully became the architect of her most ingenious world yet.Magic and technology; I never ceased to be amazed by the balance and contrast of how these two elements were mixed; how naturally it was managed. Not to mention the spin on the traits of angels (as we know SJM loves to do, now inspired by angels in Judaism), changing them from holy, perfect idols to arrogant bastards. And there is, ofc, the usual animalistic Fae and shifters touch on the usually-known-as serene creatures—some would dislike her focus on their lupine and canine and feline sides, perhaps finding it uncomfortable, but to me, it is refreshing and precise, as it feels more grittily realistic. What are humans but slightly more intelligent animals? And demonstrating how said connection to the wilds would affect these individuals is a sprinkle of accuracy in Maas’s favour.In Crescent City, Maas is inspired by multiple mythologies and uses the occasional familiar name to make all the foreign and new information less overwhelming while providing a new outlook on their definitions with clever new interpretations. Such as Midgard, originally land of the mortals between Asgard (land of the gods) and Helheim (land of the dead) in Norse mythology, here used as the name of the planet mortals made their lives upon before the godlike magical beings left their worlds and pushed in from the Northern Rift, also hosting the Quiet Realms were the dead dwell.Midgard is a world divided by power. Literally. There are tests to determine a Vanir’s level of magic, and the one bearing more of it stands higher on the hierarchy (the down to earth ones having a celebrity-like position in the society). And humans, with no power, do not get much credit despite their efforts in guiding the city to technological advancement, having their achievements funded and claimed by rulers who are smart enough not to leave room for their inferior species thriving while they themselves cling to old traditions.Additionally, as fits the urban fantasy genre, the focus is on the city and its world building—so while we learn about the system of the planet in general, most of our knowledge and wanderings happen within the confines of Lunathion, a city holding the same nickname as New Orleans, and throwing nudges to it in more than one way.All together, the world of Crescent City is so rich it’s dripping in gems and shadows and drugs, and its exquisite creatures, artfully shaped and accordingly named landscapes, temples of pleasure, and magical libraries with sneaky books could sweep you beneath its dark waves and crush you in the jaws of the horrifying nøkks waiting for your boat to tip.Note: I was right! This is the “glittering city on the curve of a river,” mentioned in Kingdom of Ash. The fact that all of SJM’s worlds exist in the same universe just brings so many possibilities to the table, and I absolutely love it.I will now proceed to the Quiet Realm of the dead, all the way across the crescent river, on my worn boat, ready to tip and leave me to drown in its dark, bloody waters.↳

”if i am to be her enemy, i want it to be because she loathes herself for wanting me.”

➷ powerless follows paedyn, a cunning and sassy street thief from the slums trying to make ends meet with her best friend. this is set in a world that went through a great plague — the majority of people who survived (the elites) were graciously gifted powers to them by the plague and those who didn’t (the ordinaries) were banished or killed. in pae’s kingdom, ordinaries are inferior to elites, and the king ordered for all ordinaries to be eliminated to preserve his elite society. paedyn is an ordinary who pretends to be an elite and poses as a psychic so that her true identity is not exposed. but when paedyn saves prince kai she finds herself thrown into the purging trials, a deadly competition held to showcase the elites’ powers — the one thing paedyn lacks.i know this book is heavily compared to Red Queen and The Hunger Games, but as i haven’t read neither of those books i can’t make any comments on that. — there is no better feeling than when a book is so good you simply can’t put it down and you end up staying up late reading it. this book had my attention gripped, especially the last 100 pages!! 1 more page turned into me finishing the whole book at 2am. i needed a fun, light, banter filled romantasy to help with my slump and this is exactly what this book delivered, both of the main characters had me in the biggest chokehold. yes this book was very tropey but it didn’t ruin my reading experience as the author cleverly wove in the tropes into this story without it feeling like she was shoving them down your throat. she did also mention that she wanted all of her favourite tropes incorporated into this book. 

“she’s so stunning, yet so stubbornly oblivious to how the sunset behind dulls in comparison to the vibrance that is her.”

➳ paedyn: right off the bat i absolutely loved pae, her sharp tongue and her even sharper mind - i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!! ➳ kai: the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!! — what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮‍💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!! 

”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”

— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect. this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!",4.0
399,People We Meet on Vacation,,3.88,"['May', '11,', '2021']","i believe in the concept of soulmates.this may seem at odds with my overall extremely cool, edgy reputation, but let me explain. sure, your soulmate might be Some Guy, but equally it might be the feeling of flipping your pillow over to the cool side, or when the airplane seems to be fully booked but slowly the trickle of people doing that awkward slow-walk to stow their luggage comes to a stop and there's no one sitting in your row, or those authentic actual cream puffs where the puff part is pretty dry and disappointing but the cream is like ice cream if ice cream was actually good. (i do not like ice cream. this is just one more point in favor of my potentially being an alien.)you may believe that i have opened this review of a romance novel with a discussion of soulmates in a way to tie in the content of the book, and in a way, you would be right. but not really.sure, yeah, the alex and poppy contained within these pages are probably soulmates, as is the case with, you know, the genre as a whole.but I'm here to talk about MY soulmate. and with every passing day I become more convinced that surely, certainly, without a doubt, that that role in my life is filled by emily henry.okay, no. that's a bridge too far in creepiness levels even for me in my love for her, a love which I have declared in multiple reviews here, on my blog, in my bookstagram in a series of tangential-to-stalking posts, in one of those letter boards i used to have when they were trendy, in her DMs, in her comments, and so on.but i should clarify that it's her WRITING that is my soulmate.my favorite super-specific subgenre of all time is magical realism where I can really believe that the magic might just exist in our dumb old boring world, and she is the master of that. plus she includes lovely romances and incredible banter and the best ever friendships and a million other good and perfect things.i cried on a Greyhound bus rereading a million junes. i, a person who does not cry even in the privacy of my own oblivion AND a person who does everything but cease to exist when on a cross-country bus trip, cried! while REREADING!i loved when the sky fell on splendor so much that i...also made my review a love letter to its author!i so adored the love that split the world that i basically almost looked past the insta-love, something that has previously forever been impossible for me to do!and when i heard about beach read, an adult rom-com interrupting an all-star lineup of YA magical realism, i wrote the email equivalent of getting on my knees and begging to the publisher right away.and that's not where everything came to a screeching halt.that, like everything else emily henry writes, or i guess wrote to that point, was a mix of fairytale-like dreaminess and real-world Harsh Reality. ot had the real characters and the engrossing writer and the dialogue of a champion like everything else.and this...well, on the first read, i thought this did too. this felt a lot more rushed than some of emily henry's other books. the writing was fun and fresh and flirty when you sped through it, but if you slow down and try to relish it, it fights you on it. sentences get clunky and overloaded.this book is in many ways my kryptonite (positive): written by emily henry, bantery, angsty. the big three of romances.and in many ways it's my kryptonite (negative): it's big-man-tiny-woman. it has a happily ever after that is more like U(nhappily)EA or O(verly compromised)EA. alex is fairly boring and poppy is not a girls' girl.on first read, all emily henry romances were simply an emily henry prescription for me, and i used them up immediately and delightedly to feed my addiction. (sorry, that metaphor turned unexpectedly dark.) but upon reread, it became clear that emily henry's characters are so full and have their own lives to such an extent that they sometimes seem like...they should not be together?a big part of me hopes that someday, emily henry will get back to the young adult magical realism that has made it to my top five favorite books and my top favorites of the year and the hard to reach upper echelons of my grueling rating system several times over.but if she doesn't, that's okay too. i'd read math textbooks if she wrote them. (but only then and not a moment before!) i just hope that she can figure out how to keep her romances as magical and well-constructed and unique as the first books. but either way she's got that instant #1 new york times bestseller status, and that, i am willing to admit, is ever so slightly more prestigious (not to mention financially rewarding) than my enduring love and affection.and she has that anyway.bottom line: i'm a grump. but it's emily henry forever.-----------------reread updatebinge reading emily henry books just to feel something(updated review to come)-------------pre-reviewand the emily henry withdrawal starts...now.(it actually started last night, when i finished this book, but it hit too hard for me to even mark it as read.)review to come / 4 stars!-------------currently-reading updatesi would die for emily henry, but that wouldn't help me get my hands on this book as soon as possible.so i subscribed to book of the month instead.-------------tbr reviewsome people write enemies to lovers romance. some people write friends to lovers romance.emily henry said why not BOTH...nobody is doing it like her!!!-------------announcement reviewwho do i have to bribe to get my hands on this book?i am willing to offer anything.

“Once upon a time, there was a human girl stolen away by faeries, and because of that, she swore to destroy them.”

Many of you might not know this but on this day many years ago, Holly Black’s biggest fan was born. Spoiler: it’s me! And I figured what better way to celebrate my birthday than to finally post my review for my favorite book of the year! I read this back in May, and it doesn’t come out until January, but celebrating my love for this book and series on my birthday just felt right. Also, I’m just that extra, but The Wicked King is perfection in every way.I love so many different kinds of books; fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, adult, books with lyrical writing, books that are character driven, books with angsty relationships, books with soul crushing emotions, books that make me feel everything. And I’ve read a lot of books; over 800 according to Goodreads. But every time I pick up a Holly Black book, I feel like she wrote the book for me. And I mean that, because she writes exactly the kind of books that I want to read. Not just key elements or parts, she completely encompasses everything I love in literature. And if I could wish one thing for everyone who reads my reviews, I’d wish for you to find an author that makes you feel this way, too. The Wicked King is the second installment in The Folk of the Air series, the first being my favorite book of 2017, The Cruel Prince! And this book starts off five months after the heart wrenching events in book one. This review is going to be spoiler free, but I will be talking about some key elements that happened in the previous book! So, please do not read this review if you do not wish to be somewhat spoiled for The Cruel Prince!

“I want to tell you so many lies.”

(The most breathtaking fanart by Loweana!)Okay, so basically a brief summary is that Jude is alone with the new High King of Faerie. Madoc and her parted on bad terms, Oak is in hiding with Vivi, Taryn is to be married to Locke, Balekin is locked up, and Cardan is *clutches pearls forever* the new king. Yet, he must listen to everything Jude says because of a trick she played on him, but all of us know how quickly a year can pass and things can change. Especially since the Queen of the Undersea, Orlagh, is thinking about breaking the treaty with the fae folk on land, since she isn’t too sure about the new ruler. And she plans to use her daughter, Nicasia, any way that she can to help secure her place of power in the fae realm. And all the courts are coming together to see if Cardan really can lead and protect them. 

“Power is much easier to acquire than it is to hold on to.”

And everyone is plotting in this book, I swear. The phrase “twists and turns” doesn’t even begin to describe the events that happen in this book. The political intrigue is so strong in this book. You won’t know who or what to believe, and you surely won’t know who to trust. And all these storylines come together to create something so beautiful. This book was a wild ride from page one to the very last page. Actually, especially the very last page. And I know everyone has already made a very big deal about the end of this book, and they aren’t wrong. You all thought The Cruel Prince cliffhanger was bad? Oh, sweet summer children. And, obviously, I won’t spoil anything, but there are so many different ways to interpret what happened. I’m going to be vague, but when you love someone or something, you will protect it at all costs. Also, the juxtaposition from book one to book two? Probably the best thing I’ve ever read in my entire life. Okay, I’m going to do a little break down for some of the characters in this book. You know, just so I can gush, fangirl, and truly be the hot mess that this book proves that I am. Also, Roiben plays a huge role in this story, which was such a wonderful surprise and I really wanted to mention it! (My favorite fanart(s) by PhantomRin!)➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My heart, my true love, my icon, my queen. Jude is my favorite protagonist and I would honestly die for her. Like, all I want in this life is for Jude to he happy, healthy, loved, and know that she is deserving of that love. 

“I’ve wanted this and feared it, and now that it’s happening, I don’t know how I will ever want anything else.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - And Cardan is probably my favorite character in literature. There, I said it. Are you happy now? Also, this book has a minor scene that really led me to believe that Cardan is pan or bi and the scream I screamed upon reading. (I’m so sorry, neighbors, if you’re reading this!) I thought I was too old or just completely over the concept of “book boyfriends” until Cardan Greenbriar decided to be created. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - I’m not even going to waste my finger strength. Bitch, bye. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Okay, say what you want, but Locke is like the greatest antagonist of all time. I am not sure I’ve ever loved to hate a character as much as I absolutely love to hate him. I also completely believe that he’s going to be the “big bad” of this series, eventually. The half-brother development is going to come into play. 

“I wish he hadn’t used me to test my sister’s love for him. I wish she hadn’t let him.”

➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Friends, I have a lot of feels. But I’m just going to say that I want few things in life as much as I want the novella, The Lost Sisters, that comes out October 2nd, 2018. I think it’s going to completely shatter everything we know about Taryn, and I’m ready for it. Oh, and in case I haven’t gushed enough, the romance in this series is my favorite romance of all-time. And like, I don’t say that lightly. I thought in The Cruel Prince that it might have been because I just love fae stories so much. But while reading The Wicked King I realized that it’s just because this is the best enemies to lovers in the history of the trope. I mean, sex is great and all, but have you ever shipped Jude and Cardan more than any relationship you’ve ever personally been in? Because, same. I honestly don’t even know how I’m functioning, let alone sitting at my desk typing this review, after reading the Queen of Mirth scene. Seriously, Holly Black is a fae queen, none of us are deserving, and her words are magical. 

“You are my dearest punishment.”

But this is also a book all about power, and the ugly things people are willing to do for it. Yet, it’s also about love, and all the beautiful, selfless, hopeful, hopeless, heartwarming, heartbreaking things we are willing to do for it. I honestly feel like the heart of this story is about sacrifice; the things we do for our family, our loved ones, and for ourselves. There is a lot of good on these pages. And I know this is a whimsical, magical book all about fae, but a lot of themes and messages carry over really beautifully. 

“It’s easy to put your own life on the line, isn’t it? To make peace with danger. But a strategist must sometimes risk others, even those we love.”

I’m not sure I’ve ever been as happy reading a book as I’ve been reading The Wicked King. Also, I seriously pretty much reread this while writing this review. Like, I opened my book back up to grab some quotes that I tabbed, and I seriously had to stop myself from consuming the whole entire story all over again. Without a doubt in my mind, I will read this again before release. It’s just that much of a masterpiece, in every single sense of the word. 

“He looks at me as though we share secrets, although we don’t. We don’t share anything.”

Overall, this review doesn’t do this book or my feelings justice. I have no word combination for how much this book, this series, and this author means to me. Yet, if you peak inside my heart, you might see my loved ones, coffee, video games, tattoos, Frank Ocean, and The Wicked King by Holly Black. Not only is this my favorite book of 2018, it’s one of my favorite things in life. And Cardan and Jude honestly have the best sexual tension in existence. I could read about them forever, with no pay off even, and I’d just ask for more.

401,The Queen of Nothing,He will be destruction of the crown and the ruination of the throne.,4.36,"['November', '19,', '2019']","1.) The Cruel Prince ★★★★★1.5) The Lost Sisters ★★★★★2.) The Wicked King ★★★★★

“By you, I am forever undone.”

I can’t believe it’s over. I feel like I’ve been in love with Holly Black’s fae stories my entire life and seeing this series finally close means more to me than I have words for, truly. This series, this world, these characters, have brought me so much unconditional happiness, and I truly am not ready to say goodbye, but I do think this was a very perfect ending. Also, a couple things before I start this actual review: 1.) I vlogged this entire reading experience (and how I wrote this review) and I hope you enjoy! 2.) This review will talk about events that happened in The Cruel Prince, The Lost Sisters, & The Wicked King, so please use caution while reading! And I will have a spoiler section for QoN later! After the very heartbreaking end of The Wicked King, Jude is now exiled from Faerie and a crown that no one knows she wears. Madoc is ready and willing to do anything to put Oak or himself on the throne, regardless of what Oak wants while living in the mortal realm with Vivi. Taryn is now married to Locke, for better or for worse, and regardless of what Jude thinks on the matter. 

“We have lived in our armor for so long, you and I. And now I am not sure if either of us knows how to remove it.”

Everything feels like it is chaos, and at the start of this book we see Jude slowly accept her fate, while also learning the pain of her anger and betrayal. She is taking side-jobs from the fae residing among humans, and she just takes on a job that is about to really test her skills. Especially when she comes out of the job realizing that things might really not be going that great for Cardan in the realm of the fae. But Jude doesn’t care, right? But she gets an opportunity to go to faerie and see for herself, regardless of her exiled status, and the situation is a matter of life and death. It’s hard to say anything else without going into spoiler territory, but I truly loved this book so much. I can’t believe how much Holly Black was able to surprise me, especially with the amount of theorycrafting I truly believed I did. From the cover, to the title, to the sneak peaks we were given; I was truly not ready for the twists and turns of this book and this entire trilogy is just masterfully crafted. 

“I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all.”

And at the heart of this book, I just really enjoyed the theme and discussion of all the different and complex relationships we will have in our lives. We see Jude constantly battling with herself and her feelings; from her past to her future, from her family to her crown, from her feelings to her heart. There are so many wars in this book, but most of them truly are from within Jude, and Holly Black really expertly talks about the human experience and existence. 

“But for one final night, he’s the father I remember best, the one in whose shadow I have—for better or worse—become what I am.”

Relationships can be so very hard and so very not pretty. Obviously we get to see Jude and Cardan, obviously we get to see Jude and her sisters, but seeing Jude and Madoc? That’s what kept breaking me. How do you love a father who became your father by killing your own? A father that loves you so very much, but loves power more? Jude and Madoc are truly the kings of this book and this chessboard, and their dynamic is truly unlike one I’ve read before. So heartbreakingly beautiful, truly. This next section of my review is going to have SPOILERS! Please do not read on if you have not read The Queen of Nothing and all the rest of the books in this series! Also, like always, I’m going to do fangirl breakdowns because it warms my heart. 

“It feels good to be fighting someone other than myself.”

➽ 
 Jude Duarte
 - My actual queen. Seeing Jude realize not only her worth, but that it is okay to hurt and to be angry, yet also that it is worth the risk to let people in sometimes; I don’t even have words, friends. Jude’s pain just resonated so much inside my heart and soul and I truly think she is one of the best literary characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. 

“He’s so beautiful, so perfectly, horribly, inhumanly beautiful that I can barely breathe.”

➽ 
 Cardan Greenbriar
 - My entire heart. All of Cardan’s lines truly broke and healed me throughout this entire book. Seeing him be the king of his people’s dreams, but also the king of his own dreams? Forever crying. Also, we stan an otp power couple for life. Truly, for life; Jude, please never leave faerie again. ➽ 
 Nicasia
 - We love a good redemption arc, wow. ➽ 
 Grima Mog
 - Nothing but love and respect for my war general. ➽ 
 Taryn Duarte
 - Oh Taryn. Listen, her pregnancy was expected, but her actually killing Locke was not. I will say that I think this was the weakest part of the story, and I truly wish we could have seen more, but maybe Holly Black is going to give us another few novellas or something. Especially with a certain bard boy? But seriously, I need so many more answers. ➽ 
 Vivi
 - My 2019 bi-icon. I was rooting for Vivi and Heather so damn hard, and I was so scared at what Vivi was going to do this book, but she was amazing through and through. When she told Madoc to bring his entire army? The biggest flex in all of 2019 literature and I was quaking. ➽ 
 Oak
 - Wow, I’m going to love me a good spin-off. ➽ 
 Madoc
 - Madoc was the character that probably made me cry the most throughout this entire series. Loving people can be so very hard, and each journey is so very different, but Madoc just really amplifies these statements and it hurts (in the best way possible) to read. The parallels between him and Jude, both truly born in blood, and seeing the different paths they take to fight each other, while always loving each other, it’s really something that I don’t have words for, but it is truly heartbreakingly beautiful. ➽ 
 Locke
 - Wow, he actually did die and Taryn actually did kill him. The biggest bamboozle of the entire book, and please call me boo boo the fool from now on while I apply my clown makeup. Okay, let’s talk about some of the big things in this book while we are in this spoiler section, too. Let’s just get the snake out of the bag (end me). You know, with all the buzz about the 2019 YA book snake, I really didn’t expect for Cardan to turn into her. Wow, truly wow. I love a good fairytale twist in my fae stories, and it was truly one worthy of ballads. Seeing Jude realize that she would rather not have Cardan than only being able to have him controlled? I will be forever crying. So beautiful. Also, the sword she did it with? Truly forever crying. I will forever and always be so surprised that Locke was not the big bad of this series and honestly? He deserved a better death and storyline ender. Like, I couldn’t believe Madoc was truly the endgame villain. This book was still so perfect to me, but this was what truly let me down the most. I wanted a satisfying Locke death and a true villain story, but it felt bad that we didn’t get that. 

“Tell me what I must slay, what I must steal, tell me the riddle I must solve or the hag I must trick. Only tell me the way, and I will do it, no matter the danger, no matter the hardship, no matter the cost.”

I also didn’t love how Cardan told everyone that him and Jude got married. I mean, trust me, I screamed and rolled around in my bed like I was thirteen, but I still wanted something more. Also, the exiled scheme he made up? Baby, that’s not it. But whatever, because when he told her that he loved her it was truly the best thing my eyes have ever read for all of 2019 and you won’t hear me complaining. Truly OTP status worthy and the best enemies to lovers I will probably ever read. I’ve had a few people tell me that they thought I’d find the ending a bit cheesy (no, this isn’t a pizza dad joke), and that’s valid, because it is a bit cheesy. But I just love these characters so much and they deserve so much happiness that I just felt really blessed to be able to experience that with them for an epilogue. Also, I have really high hopes for what is to come with Oak, because there is no way that Holly Black set that up to not masterfully tell what is to come for Faerie. I will also be honest and say that this was probably my least favorite in the series. Also, these books are always split up in two parts (or books), and the first half of this was six star worthy. Truly better than anything I’ve read this entire year. It was the last half (and cheesy epilogue) that didn’t quite live up to my expectations. But again, this series just means so much to me and it truly feels once in a lifetime to me. Overall, I just believe this is the series of my heart. Holly Black and her fae stories have truly shaped me into the reader and reviewer I am today. I owe her so much, and this concluding novel just felt like lifeblood to me. No other book has made me as happy reading. No other book has had me spam refreshing my kindle app to make sure it downloads. No other book has ever been more my brand. And I’m not sure if any book series ever will. It is a truly honor to read and review this book, and it’s more of an honor that some people correlate it with me. I know that no amount of words that I string together will ever adequately do justice to how much these books mean to me, but I promise to shout about them forever, and keep them in my heart always. And I hope that every reader has a series that makes them feel the way The Folk of the Air has made me feel.

402,Taming 7,,4.29,"['April', '16,', '2024']","this book coming out the same week as tortured poet's department is a crime. i am so unwell right now.just want to say, i love how most of us audibly gasped and clutched our pearls when they announced that this was NOT a duology that's 2k+ pages each. i mean, i would've gladly read more johnnygibsie bromance, joeyaoife being cute lil parents, lizzie yelling at the rugby boys, and mammy and daddy kavanagh traumatizing johnny, etc.but alas. we're not getting duologies and 2k+ pages anymore and i don't know how i feel about that.see, i had no hope this was ever going to come out. i read this series back in 2018 (i'm considered vintage now to some of you lot - apologies) and guys. GUYS. you have no idea how much i have been anticipating reading about clairegibsie. when this author went on hiatus for years (years!!!), i lost all hope that this book was ever gonna be written. we weren't even being fed crumbs, we were being fed subatomic particles on her facebook group. it was insane really. and ever since joeyaoife's book came out, that hope that was long buried years ago suddenly resurfaced and color me surprised when clairegibsie's book came out before hughielizzie's (which was the original plan i heard). so just imagine me waiting 6 years for this to come out, losing all hope that this was ever going to come out, gaining said hope that this was finally going to come out aaand for this book to end up being sooo... i don't know. i genuinely do not know.i just know that this book felt more like an extended epilogue of johnnyshannon and a prologue to hughielizzie which normally i wouldn't complain about because i love johnnyshannon and hughielizzie... eh. still on the fence with those two but i'm not opposed to snippets. but instead of getting snippets, we genuinely got half of the books content about everyone else BUT clairegibsie.!!! this is a clairegibsie book !!!this is their book and yet this didn’t feel like their book at all.i am so disappointed and heartbroken and i have a lot of feelings about this so just let me rant for a few moments and move on with your day ok? ok.･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･ SPOILERS AHEAD ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．↠ ˗ˏˋ ♡ 
R O M A N C E
 ♡ ´ˎ˗where?where is it? because i'm still looking for it.unfortunately, because of external factors *cough* lizzie drama *cough* the actual romance was overshadowed by so so sooo many things. this book lacked the chemistry clairegibsie had in b13 & k13. it seems like they were more in love there than in their own book which actually saddens me to my core. genuinely. i'm actually so sad writing this review right now because i should be filled with excitement and happiness because one of my most anticipated couples that i have been waiting for for years finally got their own book but instead, im filled with everything but that.I. NEEDED. MORE.i needed more angst. i needed more drama. i needed more jealousy. i needed more chemistry. i needed MORE. i needed what they had in b13 & k13 and this is ridiculous because they were side characters there and then when they're the main characters of their own book, this is how it's written?? even one of the snippets i saw on the facebook group a year or two ago had more chemistry than any of clairegisbsie's scenes here. i don't know if this is because this is the first book in the series where one of the main characters isn't a Lynch member or if the book is shorter than the rest and this isn't going to be a duology but i hate it. i am filled with so much heartbreak right now like i can't even comprehend how i could ever feel this way.now there are some sweet moments that i absolutely loved like the prologue, the hot tub scene, gibsie whining to this mother because claire went on a date with someone else, etc. there are some scenes where i finally got a glimpse of the clairegibsie we deserved but it gets snatched away because of the annoying drama. the moments the main couple had were not satisfying to read, especially in the first half.exhibit A: the hot tub scene. this was so important to not only the romantic development but to gibsie's character healing/development as well! he finally got inside a bathtub and overcame his fear and you’re telling me this huge eventful scene... is just... going to be brushed off?? just like that?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! CLAIREGIBSIE. DESERVES. BETTER.these two had such good tropes (childhood friends to lovers, mutual pining and longing, jealousy) and this book did not utilize any of these tropes well. though, one thing i'll say is i've seen people say that this has the girl-obsessed trope. this is not that at all. if you want to read a book with the girl-obsessed trope just read a cora reilly book.oh - also, !! fucking knew gibsie was a virgin/fake fuckboy !!↠ ˗ˏˋ ♡ 
W R I T I N G
 ♡ ´ˎ˗hot take that's not really a hot take: i wish this was never traditionally published.listen!! before you throw your pitchforks at me, i have been reading for more than a decade now and whenever an author gets traditionally published the writing quality just... goes down. and this isn't even a conspiracy theory. it's the truth. this book is an example of it.fillers upon fillers upon fillers!! UPON FILLERS!! the first 4 books of this series explored the characters so well, especially joey (i'm still not over this character ugh my poor baby). even johnny - the most normal and least traumatized out of all of them - was explored well. so you see, my expectations were high and i expected claire and gibsie to be treated the same way the other main characters were written but no. we didn't get that. at all. there were no thoughts behind these characters' development and depth. gibsie went through something horrendous and his trauma and healing journey was not handled well. at all. CLAIREGIBSIE. DESERVES. BETTER.the repetitiveness of, well, everything really, was irksome to say the least. there were so many mindless inner monologue that was basically exposition where claire or gibsie gives us a rundown about the previous couples. i remember reading one of claire's inner monologues where she talked about johnnyshannon being soulmates and how they're each other's for keeps overand overAnd OverAND OverAND OVERAND OVER AGAIN.i was so sick and tired of it. I GET IT. I GET THEY'RE SOULMATES. you don't have to repeat it overand overAnd OverAND OverAND OVERAND OVER AGAIN.this also doesn’t even feel like the same author wrote this book. it feels like a millennial trying to write like a gen z even though the characters here are millennials in their teens. i mean seriously? overuse of ""besties""? ""era""?? just - no. please stop. also, these characters are irish but they strangely sound american here. i hate it. i needed more jaysus's, more eejit's, more ye’s, more gobshites, more feckin’, just- more. more, more, MORE.and i don't know if this is true but there's a rumor around that said 30,000 - 60,000 was cut from this book. who ever decided this?

 ♡ ´ˎ˗now listen. lizzie.. girl... i get your traumatized and hurt and are mad at the whole world but... girlie pop please. i don't know how i can defend you here.i never hated lizzie but i also never cared for her that much. in fact, i was more indifferent (but understanding) of her especially in joey's book (though, i actually liked her in joey's book) but... girlie was doing too much here. attacking katie and insinuating she has an eating disorder over marmite? telling gibsie he should've died instead and their DEAD father saved the wrong child???? and again, may i repeat - OVER MARMITE?????i was shocked honey, in tears almost.i love ice cold, bitchy characters but she was just unnecessarily cruel to people who don't deserve it. i get with redemption arc comes with hitting rock bottom first and all that but i genuinely don’t understand how you can make the next main character of a series be this unlikeable. not even nesta was this bad in acosf.the way she talks to her friends, especially claire, gave me ptsd because i had a friend like this back in high school. when i get excited over something, (ex) friend would say something snarky - bringing me down and making me feel like shit. and as a 20-something-year-old woman, i still remember the passive-aggressive attitude (ex) friend said/did. that shit sticks. from what i've read, claire was constantly being brought down again and again. she said she was lizzie's punching bag and honestly? she really was. and i don't know if this is an unpopular opinion but i don't blame claire cutting lizzie off for now (emphasis on ""for now"" people!!). obviously, there's room for redemption, forgiveness and reconciliation in the future but for now? i don't blame her. there's only so much you can take.and there's also so much *I* can take because this drama with lizzie was grating on my nerves so much i genuinely almost dnf'ed this book and i never thought i could ever even want to dnf clairegibsie's book. as mentioned before, this book honestly just feels like a novella meant to be hughielizzie's prologue. i find it ridiculous that the main couple for this book wasn't the center point of their own book. it's enraging, really.CLAIREGIBSIE. DESERVES. BETTER.and can i just say, love that some characters have lizzie's back and try to understand her, however, what really irks me is the fact that while they defend and try to understand her, they never try to understand the people that were hurt by lizzie's words. they're silent while lizzie spews venom towards others but once those people have a backbone and try to defend themselves, *certain characters* suddenly try to calm the situation down and tell the person who was just verbally attacked that they need to understand that lizzie is hurting, she's in pain, etc... listen. it's one thing to defend someone and try to understand their pain, but it's another thing to actually call them out when they're straight up 
BULLYING 
 people. and yes, she was a 
BULLY
 here. let’s not sugar coat it. like shannon, i love you girl but you experienced bullying yourself throughout most of your life but then you're gonna pull the “hurt people hurt people” justification to defend your friend’s bullying?? i’ve seen some people say lizzie’s character arc was ruined because of this book and i disagree. we barely know her from the previous books and we were only given snippets from various pov’s. and i’d like to repeat this again: WE BARELY KNOW HER. how can her arc be ruined when it hasn’t even begun yet? even though lizzie is not fully on my good side for now (emphasis on for now!!!), i still want to read her redemption arc/healing journey/character development. and some of you may be asking: how can you look forward to her book? i thought you think she’s a bully, she’s mean, blah blah blah. did you guys know you can understand and sympathize with a character but also won’t justify their actions and call them out when they’re being shitty and deservedly criticize them? *gasp* *clutches pearls* wow. i know. shocker. i didn’t know this can happen either.↠ ˗ˏˋ ♡ 
LAST 25%
 ♡ ´ˎ˗now, the last 25% made me sob. although i think gibsie’s trauma wasn’t handled well throughout the book it still broke my heart knowing what happened to him - this goofy idiot who makes everyone laugh and tries so hard to make people happy went through all of that?!FUCK. YOU. MARK.and unfortunately, i knew this was coming not only because i saw some hints back in k13 that something must’ve happened to him and i thought it revolves around the secretary but no. i knew this was coming because this was spoiled to me because you know, since the leaks were out and all apparently that gave *some* people the go ahead to write 1-star reviews based on the leaks (weeks before this book came out by the way). it’s one thing to give trigger warnings before the book was out but… the things i’ve seen were… hm. let’s just say i find it interesting that only certain things were leaked/spoiled because now that we all know the full context? hmm… interesting. and on another note, johnny hugging gibsie and crying with him? AAAAHHHH THESE TWO ARE SO FUCKING PRECIOUSgod i love these two so much.↠ ˗ˏˋ ♡ 
JOHNNYGIBSIE
 ♡ ´ˎ˗yes, i’m talking about these two eejits some more because they their own category. they're the only thing i truly, whole-heartedly liked here.and i will be honest - i care more about their bromance than any of the other romances right now. my favorite scene was gibsie being the big spoon to johnny's little spoon. they're like dariusorion but irish. and human. ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･ SPOILERS DISCUSSION DONE ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･I SWEAR TO GOD IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO SOOKIE CW YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS. just had to say this because i saw a snippet from a fb post and nahhh. sookie is immortal ok? there’s no way this precious dog is every dying. ever. i don't have a proper rating for this book right now. this is not a 1-star but this is, unfortunately, also not a 5-star read either. i don't know. but for now, i'll stick to my non-rated review. i need a month to stew on this. or a year.mini update: decided on 3-stars for my rating (my heart is breaking because i’m pretty sure i rated all BoT books 5-stars).anyways, i'm so sad right now so i'll just reread k13 because that’s my fave BoT book of all time and it's an ultimate comfort read. nothing has ever topped that.but as always, just wanted to provide a gentle reminder:CLAIREGIBSIE.

403,Part of Your World,The New York Times bestselling author of Life's Too Short delivers a refreshingly modern fairy tale perfect for fans of Casey McQuiston and Emily Henry.,4.30,"['April', '19,', '2022']","I’m just slapping my head so hard! Why the hell did I wait too long to jump into this MARVELOUS JOURNEY! I’m telling you my friends: this is the BEST ABBY JIMENEZ BOOK! Absolutely her best work! I cried and laughed so much and sometimes I did it at the same time! The book brings out so many different you buried inside and help you set them free! A workaholic, responsible ER doctor’s path crosses accidentally with a small town mayor: when her car stuck in a ditch: blame it on mischievous raccoon! Alexis: coming her ultra wealthy family who are world-renowned surgeons, differentiating her path by becoming an ER doctor. At age 37, she suffered enough from emotional, verbal, physical abuse of her ex and her own family. By a car accident, she finds herself in a small town Wakanda forever ( okay, I wrote it to check if you are still reading me!) correct name is : Wakan. Daniel: who saves Alexis from ditch, caring sweetheart and definitely dreamy book boyfriend! Yeap, he’s younger than her, mayor of town, efficient carpenter, running her grandparents’ B&B. The guy checks all the boxes! I don’t know how Abby Jimenez creates the best hero characters in her books. Each one of them are exceptional. And luckily this time Alexis is also easy to roof for with her resilience, honesty, genuineness.As long as Alexis spends her time in that small town, taking a break for her responsibilities, extra busy schedule, burdens from past, she realizes she can find the happiness at a place with a man she never imagined before. I have to admit some parts of the book truly hurt me: reading about traumatic experience Alexis has been through was really painful. I got so sad, angry, heartbroken. The angsty part was truly realistic, hard to digest!But like a sun coming out of the clouds: the sweet and promising love story of the book warmed my heart! I love this book so much! I am absolutely giving my five small town, amazingly adorable hero, second chances, emotional stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Forever ( Grand Central Publishing) for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5.0
404,Bridesmaid for Hire,Sometimes the wedding of the century calls for desperate measures.And sometimes those desperate measures are to pretend the person you hate most is actually your boyfriend.,4.01,"['April', '2,', '2024']","The first quarter of this book - it was absolutely a 5 star read. I laughed out loud so many times. It reminded me of the unhoneymooners which is one of my favs.Then… there were a lot of situations that were happening with the MMC that made him seem very weak and outrageous, very accident prone. It made him extremely less sexy in my eyes. BUT I still could have gotten past that.My biggest problem was the unnecessary length of this book. I felt like there was A LOT of unnecessary moments that ruined a magical beginning of a book and made me start skimming through certain parts. I almost felt like 3/4 of the way through, this author was trying so hard and it wasn’t working.Overall, I rate the first 1/4 of this book 6 stars and the rest like 2-3 stars. I wish it kept the magic of the first part. I still suggest people read the first part, because that was great.",3.0
405,Beach Read,A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.,4.01,"['May', '19,', '2020']","This is my favorite romance read of the year. It came at the second place throughout the voting on goodreads choice awards. But my thoughts haven’t changed! I loved it so so so much!💞💞💞💞OH MYYYYY GOODNESSSSSS! Finally literature gods heard my prayers that I’ve been requesting to read a fantastic romance that I’ve been craving for so long! I need something heart wrenching, shaking me to the core, help me feel everything at the same time: happiness, angst, joy, forgiveness, enjoyment, resentment, hurting! Yes, I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I want to scream it! Oh, thankfully I already did! I have to add that: This is not beach read. This is GLUED READ. You don’t want to end it and you don’t want to stop reading it so you carry your book at everywhere as if it’s one of your internal organs.  I expected to read something more chic lit, soft, sweet story but instead of that, I got an amazing fiction, a remarkable romance juggles between so many things at the same time from friendship, regrets, cancer, betrayal, dysfunctional families and their secrets, enemies to friends and friends to lovers, rivalry between the authors!The things I loved mostly:-Sarcastic but so smart, entertaining, unique dialogues between January and Gus-The soul crushing, tear jerker, heart shattering, intense father and daughter relationship-Captivating the story telling from the beginning: I couldn’t put down this book. I actually devour the pages (maybe I accidentally licked my kindle but its screen looks dustless and I’m the grossest person right now!), I couldn’t stop reading January and Gus’ growing attraction, their struggles to open up and their scares not to get hurt, their stupid and childish actions towards each other. Yes I had some many “awww” and sighing moments. My husband thought I was secretly ordering cases of French wines because I smiled so much and I got appointment from the surgeon because it glued to my face and I’m looking like worse version of Joker right now! I cannot stop!-A witty plot: Two writers were nemesis from college now neighboring beach houses. They both have their deadlines for their books but they’re suffering from writer’s big bold scary blog! (Did it ever happen to me? Nope, after drinking, words pour out from my mind like torrent but next day editing them when you are sober is the most painful experience!) Gus thinks that HEA doesn’t exist but he can push himself to write about it and January could also write some high rated, complex fiction instead of swoony romances! So they bet and replace their places but for inspiration to do that they have to spend time together by experiencing the shiny and dark sides of the life. That means January will take him to carnival, romantic beach and field trips to watch the sunset as Gus takes him to hike at the graveyard or arrange an interview with a grieving woman who lost her death cult member sister. See, it was impossible not to get interested and hooked from the beginning!-Characterization: January and Gus seems like polar opposites. One pessimist who had problematic childhood with his abusive father and one optimist Pollyanna who loves to see from the brighter side even though her childhood was affected by her mother’s big C hanging over her head like the Sword of Damocles. They are suffering from loneliness and their wrong choices about their love lives. Actually they have so much in common and don’t forget THE SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and UNDENIABLY GROWING ATTRACTION!LAST PARTS OF THE BOOK: Oh boy! Please prepare your napkins, paper towels, anything to dry your non-stop dripping tears! I’m not giving spoiler but Ms. Henry is an emotional torturer knows exactly how to sing to our hearts, how to break into pieces and magically gathers each pieces and heals you with soul brushing, poignant words. She is a heart whisperer. She knows how to melt your heart!OVERALL: This is not only one of my favorite books of this year but it is also gonna be my all-time favorite romance books! I’m so happy my great written romantic fiction craving is over!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this year’s one of the best books’ ARC COPY with me in exchange my honest review.

406,"Red, White & Royal Blue",,4.09,"['May', '14,', '2019']","I am a soulless void. I have definitely said this before, but I don’t know if you’ve really HEARD me. And they say actions speak louder than words, so here I am.Taking this book, which everyone has hailed as pure joy / cookie-level sweetness / the greatest romance of our generation even though it’s fictional / overall so happiness-bringing it seems like it should be relegated to black market dealings…Rereading it...and dropping a three point five rating (already gives a Scrooge-like aura of grumpiness) to...two point five. (DON’T HURT ME.)And generally being so discombobulated and displeased that I have to write a whole new review.(If you know anything about me, you know I am too lazy to write multiple reviews of one book unless the circumstances are truly life-ending-ly dire. That’s where we’re at.)This just. Did not do it for me.Let’s talk about why, in bullet points, so as to hopefully limit my wordiness and therefore limit how mad at me you guys will be (please don’t yell at me I am already heartless and depressed):- THE ROMANCE: First time I read this, I felt like the human equivalent of a waffle. Sweet and fluffy and, uh, delicious. (I didn’t have a third one.) This time, the plot (which is just romance) never grabbed my attention, and the cheesy love story...grated. (Get it? Because cheese? Come on, now you can’t yell at me. That was too good.)- THE SMUT: Okay, I’ll admit this is personal preference. I don’t like when there’s too much smut in a book. That’s a me problem, however, and usually I will remedy it by just not reading it. However if I had skipped all explicit scenes in this book, I would only have a pamphlet trying to get me to join the fictional perfect glorified Democratic Party in my hands. (But more on that later.) Anyway, a romance that is 99% either sexting or sex is not convincing or fun for me. Sorry.- THE CHARACTERS: I love Bex or Bea (I think it’s Bea), and I love Henry’s friend whose name I can’t remember (is it Pez? Or is that just a candy), I love June and Nora so much I would marry them, and also remember their names, which is apparently high praise for me. Henry and Alex, however...I hate very much. They are annoying. Alex is obnoxious and made me feel like either a) a person with a hangover yelling at the still-drunk people to shut up or b) a grumpy old man telling snot-nosed children from the 1950s to get out of his yard. Henry is just boring.- THE POLITICS: This is, by far, the WORST thing about this book. It’s what got my first read to drop from presumably 5 to 3.5. Single-handedly. And it’s even more gruesome the second time. This is the most idealized, grotesque, good-versus-evil look at politics I have EVER SEEN. In this book, the Democrats are a rainbow-wearing gloriously diverse coalition of kumbaya-singing angels, and everyone else is a villain we won’t talk about. Democrats are 100% motivated purely by the love of Doing The Right Thing, and they have never done anything wrong, ever, in their lives. The American people love them implicitly and will turn historically red states blue just to show them that. It’s not only sickening, it’s damaging. DO NOT IDEALIZE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE NOT CELEBRITIES. Don’t you think I want to get EMMA + AOC tattooed on my lower back? I do. But I won’t because she is a person who is driven to power, and all of those people have flaws.In the interest of full transparency, I am a leftist, so I by definition think the Democrats are a little better than the Republicans. But I mostly think that glorifying parties is f*cked up and wrong, and results in things like sainting Pelosi and falling in love with Fauci and generally being unable to hold people accountable for doing their job (which is representing you), and therefore results in corruption and useless politicians and the end of the world.Dramatic enough for a stopping point?Bottom line: Before you guys start yelling at me, can anyone refer me to a good dentist? I got a cavity in every tooth from how saccharine this book is.--------------------reread pre-reviewrounding this rating down because the overall political fanfiction vibe is a lot harder to ignore on round 2. potential updated review to come / was 3.5 stars, might be 3 now----------reread updatesstarting the year as i mean to go on: buddy reading with lily--------------------original reviewTHIS IS THE CUTEST FLUFFIEST BOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.This made me...blush? And I famously cannot blush. One time my high school English teacher overheard me saying I didn’t do the assigned reading and he called me out in front of the whole class, and I, like a tiny badass (pretending my heart wasn’t pounding and I wasn’t more nervous than I’ve ever been), was like “Yeah, I’m not trying to hide anything. I didn’t do the reading.” And he, taken aback, went, “...You’re not even blushing.”So, to recap: me, a school-obsessed profoundly shy 15-year-old being called out in front of all her very cool peers by her scary old man teacher = no blushing.The sheer adorableness of this book = Blush City, population me.CASEY MCQUISTON IS A STAR.This book has:- amazing banter- the best side characters - fantastic friendships - so much humor (I laughed! At a book! When does that HAPPEN!) - tons of angst (actually too much angst sometimes - I got a little tired of this book towards the end) - a great meet cute (except not actually a meeting. A re-meet-cute? Can I coin a term?)- the best idea for a forbidden / enemies-to-lovers romance EVER!!! No exaggeration.So, in short, Casey McQuiston is, after just one book, a complete auto-buy author for me.However.This was not a perfect book. And in truth it made me cringe many times.Like, yes, on the one hand everyone is right and this is the cutest, fluffiest, most fun read of all time.On the other hand...I do not want my politics to be cute-fluffy-fun. I do not want them to be revisionist history where the current administration is absurdly well motivated and diverse and perfect and there is no corruption or back-hallway negotiation at all. It’s not realistic and to be honest, it makes me cringe.If I wanted an idealized-to-the-point-of-unbelievability fictional American president, I’d watch the West Wing and ignore the bigoted parts.I also think the scene with the Queen of England was Cringe Central. Again, not realistic, just completely good politics versus completely bad politics depending on which better serves the plot.This just felt...very juvenile. And I’m not saying that romance novels need to have the best ever take on politics. I’m not even saying that I was reading this book FOR the politics.All I’m saying is...I care about politics and seeing it idealized and completely unrealistic took me out of the story??(Can I say the word politics more.)Anyway. Even that was not enough to take away from this book so much for it to be a negative rating or an unenjoyable read.But...it was a takeaway. (SORRY.)Bottom line: Casey McQuiston give me your next book immediately please, and also thank you for not writing it about politics.

OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD THIS IS MY FAVORITE ROMANCE BOOK EVER NOW EMILY HENRY I'D ACTUALLY DIE FOR YOU I'M SERIOUSi finally read book lovers. and i literally want to DIEthis is about to be a ramble, so just bear with me.here is a nice little dilemma: there’s a bright side and a not so bright side of emily henry’s books. on the bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.on the not so bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.do you see that double edged sword?book lovers is my perfect romance. it will never, ever get better for me than this. i know this is such a bold statement, but let me explain why: book lovers had everything i want in a book, let alone a romance. it made me feel seen through nora. the workaholic city girl who’s seen as cold and withdrawn (nora’s ex’s you never even cry in the prologue was a personal attack). the neurotic control freak who’s terrified of even giving a tiny bit of that up. the older sister who would do anything for her younger sister. i don’t think the way i 100% related to nora will ever be replicated in any other book (this book and conversation with friends will always be it for me).this book is actually on my top 5 books EVER. my top 5 (in no particular order) now goes: the secret history, conversation with friends, persuasion, anna karenina, and…BOOK LOVERS.if you’ve been following me…you know how monumental this is for picky romance bitch elle. this makes up for every single horrendous romance book i read last year that i one starred.holy shit. this book is PERFECT. the characters, the chemistry, the emotions, the banter, the romance?? i actually cannot stress how perfect this is.i am picky and i am a cynic. i have been so consistently disappointed by anything romantic in my life. but this book made me actually realistically hopeful for the fist time. because while romance was the main plot, nora and charlie’s respective problems did not get overshadowed. the heavy topics mentioned were nuanced and fleshed out and handled with such a great amount of depth.nora is me. i can’t describe her another way. i have never read a character who so closely resembles my personality (frances from conversation with friends resembles the way i think + my self reflections, but nora’s personality is just completely me). emily henry crawled inside my brain and took my thoughts and my experiences. wow.reading this made me stupidly optimistic that maybe i can too find a very hot and swoon-worthy guy who can deal with me in all my control freak, neurotic, workaholic, bitchy city girl glory. one can dream.see? this is what good romance books do to me. it makes me actually have…(gags) hope.charlie is the perfect combination of sweet and sarcastic and aloof and brooding. also, at one point, he lines up all of his utensils in a row which was just SO hot to me? and the way he’s so blunt and straightforward and honest and heartfelt without being an asshole or cringey. he’s loyal and understanding and never makes nora sacrifice anything, which is something we really don’t see in romance books. god. what a perfect, perfect man.not only that, but this book has THE best banter and chemistry i have ever seen. and i don’t mean that lightly. and charlie. i promised i’d elaborate on charlie in my pre-review, so here is me trying to sum up just how much i love him.and this book. this book is also a love letter to all eldest siblings. the way nora loves her sister and the responsibilities charlie had. anyone who is the eldest sibling or an older sibling will 100% understand. emily henry is always able to write family with such heart and depth, and this is no different.i will never shut up about this book. i’m about to become SO insufferable for the next month.i can’t get over how perfect this book was. i’m going to reread it again tomorrow.",5.0
408,People We Meet on Vacation,,3.88,"['May', '11,', '2021']","i believe in the concept of soulmates.this may seem at odds with my overall extremely cool, edgy reputation, but let me explain. sure, your soulmate might be Some Guy, but equally it might be the feeling of flipping your pillow over to the cool side, or when the airplane seems to be fully booked but slowly the trickle of people doing that awkward slow-walk to stow their luggage comes to a stop and there's no one sitting in your row, or those authentic actual cream puffs where the puff part is pretty dry and disappointing but the cream is like ice cream if ice cream was actually good. (i do not like ice cream. this is just one more point in favor of my potentially being an alien.)you may believe that i have opened this review of a romance novel with a discussion of soulmates in a way to tie in the content of the book, and in a way, you would be right. but not really.sure, yeah, the alex and poppy contained within these pages are probably soulmates, as is the case with, you know, the genre as a whole.but I'm here to talk about MY soulmate. and with every passing day I become more convinced that surely, certainly, without a doubt, that that role in my life is filled by emily henry.okay, no. that's a bridge too far in creepiness levels even for me in my love for her, a love which I have declared in multiple reviews here, on my blog, in my bookstagram in a series of tangential-to-stalking posts, in one of those letter boards i used to have when they were trendy, in her DMs, in her comments, and so on.but i should clarify that it's her WRITING that is my soulmate.my favorite super-specific subgenre of all time is magical realism where I can really believe that the magic might just exist in our dumb old boring world, and she is the master of that. plus she includes lovely romances and incredible banter and the best ever friendships and a million other good and perfect things.i cried on a Greyhound bus rereading a million junes. i, a person who does not cry even in the privacy of my own oblivion AND a person who does everything but cease to exist when on a cross-country bus trip, cried! while REREADING!i loved when the sky fell on splendor so much that i...also made my review a love letter to its author!i so adored the love that split the world that i basically almost looked past the insta-love, something that has previously forever been impossible for me to do!and when i heard about beach read, an adult rom-com interrupting an all-star lineup of YA magical realism, i wrote the email equivalent of getting on my knees and begging to the publisher right away.and that's not where everything came to a screeching halt.that, like everything else emily henry writes, or i guess wrote to that point, was a mix of fairytale-like dreaminess and real-world Harsh Reality. ot had the real characters and the engrossing writer and the dialogue of a champion like everything else.and this...well, on the first read, i thought this did too. this felt a lot more rushed than some of emily henry's other books. the writing was fun and fresh and flirty when you sped through it, but if you slow down and try to relish it, it fights you on it. sentences get clunky and overloaded.this book is in many ways my kryptonite (positive): written by emily henry, bantery, angsty. the big three of romances.and in many ways it's my kryptonite (negative): it's big-man-tiny-woman. it has a happily ever after that is more like U(nhappily)EA or O(verly compromised)EA. alex is fairly boring and poppy is not a girls' girl.on first read, all emily henry romances were simply an emily henry prescription for me, and i used them up immediately and delightedly to feed my addiction. (sorry, that metaphor turned unexpectedly dark.) but upon reread, it became clear that emily henry's characters are so full and have their own lives to such an extent that they sometimes seem like...they should not be together?a big part of me hopes that someday, emily henry will get back to the young adult magical realism that has made it to my top five favorite books and my top favorites of the year and the hard to reach upper echelons of my grueling rating system several times over.but if she doesn't, that's okay too. i'd read math textbooks if she wrote them. (but only then and not a moment before!) i just hope that she can figure out how to keep her romances as magical and well-constructed and unique as the first books. but either way she's got that instant #1 new york times bestseller status, and that, i am willing to admit, is ever so slightly more prestigious (not to mention financially rewarding) than my enduring love and affection.and she has that anyway.bottom line: i'm a grump. but it's emily henry forever.-----------------reread updatebinge reading emily henry books just to feel something(updated review to come)-------------pre-reviewand the emily henry withdrawal starts...now.(it actually started last night, when i finished this book, but it hit too hard for me to even mark it as read.)review to come / 4 stars!-------------currently-reading updatesi would die for emily henry, but that wouldn't help me get my hands on this book as soon as possible.so i subscribed to book of the month instead.-------------tbr reviewsome people write enemies to lovers romance. some people write friends to lovers romance.emily henry said why not BOTH...nobody is doing it like her!!!-------------announcement reviewwho do i have to bribe to get my hands on this book?i am willing to offer anything.

409,The Hating Game,,3.90,"['August', '9,', '2016']","This is another one of those books I've owned since it (almost) came out but I never got around reading it. Funny story: I almost bought another copy of this because I thought I lost my copy of it. I'm embarrassed to admit that I almost cried. Books are expensive. I'm so glad I found my copy and didn't buy a new one though, or I would have been crying but they wouldn't be happy tears. The elevator scene. I don't get it.

It was nineteen percent in and they were already throwing lustful eyes at each other.I will be honest though and say that even if a romance has that, there is still potential for the story to pick up and be enjoyable. But, in this case, it wasn't. There wasn't one moment where I enjoyed reading this. I was bored the entire time. It's a wonder I finished it.This is just one of the worst romance novels I've read. Office rom-com my ass. I found nothing funny about this. Where was the comedy? There are also hardly office scenes besides the two staring at each other the entire time. There is really no humor in this whatsoever. Josh and Lucy's banter was not in any way funny. I don't get it man.I'm not going to write a full review for this but I'll mention some things I quicky wrote on my notes as I was reading:3% in: Apparently Josh’s blue Post-its make his desk the male version of hers. Also because he has mints instead of lipstick, whatever that means.14% in: Lucy has her first wet dream with and of Josh. She then spends every waking moment thinking of him, his muscles, his body against hers, and, well, you get the point.19% in: Josh kisses Lucy in the elevator even though he didn’t ask her because he’s been trying to prove a theory he’s had for a while. Before he kissed her, she put her arms in defense and thought he was going to kill her. After kissing her, she's clearly weak, meaning she enjoyed it, of course. When she asked him why he kissed her, he just said “I had to prove a theory” and ignores her wonder because he really didn’t answer her question. 24% in: The office gang has a paintball match. Danny, a designer who used to work with Josh and Lucy, is clearly interested in Lucy, and in that moment, she is as well. Danny tries getting close to Lucy but Josh snaps at Danny when he talks to her. He also shot him with his paintball gun when Danny waved to Lucy. Like, seriously?? You’re that jealous???32% in: Josh takes care of Lucy. He lowkey shows signs of jealousy when Lucy calls his brother cute (keep in mind that his brother, Patrick, is getting married. I don’t know what Josh’s deal is).47% in: “But . . .” My voice is plaintive. “I thought . . .” His eyebrows pinch together in a fake display of incomprehension. “You know . . .” “It’s rather hurtful to only be wanted for my body. I didn’t even get the date beforehand.” He looks down at our hands again.This scene just made me laugh. Here’s how this went: Lucy tells Josh she wants to be friends with him, or something.Josh asks Lucy what she means by “something.”Lucy says to be friends or to be people that don’t hate each other.Josh asks Lucy if Danny is her boyfriend, which she answers to no but not directly. The two have a moment where they’re all lovey again. Lucy then tells Josh she’s gonna try and play the “Or Something Game” with him.The two then get sexually tensed.Josh then tells Lucy he wants her to have her date with Danny and kiss him and that he wants to know if it was good. He says the Or Something Game cannot proceed until she tells him. He then says if the kiss isn’t as good as his (Josh), she can’t kiss him (Danny) again. Did I mention they were in a janitors room? Well they are so after this Josh pushes Lucy out. Lucy makes an excuse for him after his boss looks for him. Josh returns 20 minutes later. Moving on. Lucy then tells her that if the Or Something Game involves sex, it will be a one time deal. Once. The two agree. He then writers his address on a blue sticky Post-it note and hands it to her.And now, Josh, you’re telling me you didn’t get a proper date when you could have denied the sex and maybe, I don’t know, asked for a date instead, Or Something???????? Did I miss something?? Lucy's date with Danny clearly didn't go well. Danny kissed her, but she didn't like it, so Josh won. She's now at his apartment, telling him this, admitting it, yada yada. As Lucy is about to leave, this is their conversation:“You’re not going to miss me, are you? You can manage one little Tuesday on your own.” He touches the little toy car in my hand and spins the wheels a little. I try to be nonchalant, but he probably sees through it. “Miss you? I’ll miss looking at your pretty face, but that’s about it.” The relationship was just pathetically sad for me at this point. 51% in: It’s the next day. Lucy sends Josh a note saying “I want you for more than your body.” Josh replies with “Glad to hear it.” Lucy then calls Josh and tells him she’s bored (implying she wants to come over), and he says “Better come over then.” And you know, personally, I don’t like sweat. It’s quite . . . gross. It’s normal, of course, but gross. Josh was working out, so Lucy says “I want to see you all sweaty.” She gets to his apartment and sees him, then she runs up to him and smells him, describing his sweat as “[rainwater and cedar], leaving a faint rosemary-pine tingle in my nostrils.”What it is about books and their sniffing??? Yeah I was really over it.93% in: “What are the marks in your planner?” It pops into my head. He didn’t answer last time; I doubt he will now. He smiles and looks at his plate. “It’s a bit juvenile.” “I’d expect nothing less of you.” “I record whether you’re wearing a dress or skirt. D, or S. I make a mark when we argue, and I make a mark when I see you smile at someone else. Also, when I wish I could kiss you. The dots are just my lunch break.”I get the lunch break dots, but, marking when she smiles at someone? It was probably when she smiled at other guys, considering everything else that’s happened and been said. I mean, he even kept the Post-it note she kissed and plastered it on his refrigerator . . . And also, making a mark for when she wore a dress or skirt? He's quite the observer, if you ask me.95% in: “What’s my favorite color?” “Easy. Blue.” “What kind of blue?” “Bedroom blue!” I point at the wall. “The walls. Your shirt. My dress. Pale Tiffany blue.” He tugs me to sit, then goes to the end of the bed. He opens his wardrobe door, and I see all of the shirts hanging in color sequence.“Josh, you dork.” I start to laugh and point, but he grabs my ankles and drags me to the end of the bed. There’s a full-length mirror, and I see myself, at long last sitting on the bed in his robin’s-egg bedroom. His walls are the blue of my eyes. I’ve been a bit slow.Ah yes, the moment Lucy finds out his walls are the color of Lucy’s eyes and loves it. Just, lovely.98% in: “I’ve been trying to drag you down with me. In the worst, most ill-conceived and socially retarded way possible.” We love the r-word being used in the context of Josh telling Lucy he’s loved her since the moment he saw her. So romantic.",1.0
410,Twilight,"Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.",3.65,"['October', '5,', '2005']","Okay, I have to say that I picked this book up partly due to all the hype (and partly because it's involved two of my favorite genres)... I mean, so many people had recommended it to me and I finally got sick of hearing about it, so I picked it up and read it... or as least tried to.Let me first say that I am a huge romance and vampire/supernatural fan, so when I first heard about the book I was really excited to read it because it combined two of my favorite genres.But, I really regret ever buying and forcing myself to finish it (I hate not finishing books, even if I hate them), it was so bad. Though, let me tell you that I really wanted to like it, really I did... I'm one of those people who likes a lot of popular things, Twilight was popular, so I figured... I would love it just like everyone else, but I was very, very wrong. A lot of fans wonder why I hate the book so much and here is my list and it's a pretty long one, so get ready:1. Lack of characterization:Bella- Okay... I absolutely hated this girl. She was the worst female protagonist I have ever read about! She's stupid, shallow, selfish and just plain annoying! Not to mention she's pathetically dependent on Edward... I mean, come on, NO girl should be that dependent on a boy, not only is that pathetic, but it is very unhealthy. She was also a clumsy little damsel in distress who was dumb enough to get herself into situations that she couldn't get out of. I would have loved for Meyer to have given her a backbone, so she could have done something useful instead of whining and doing stupid, idiotic things that no remotely intelligent teenage girl would actually do. Not to mention the fact that she is apparently very ""plain"" looking... if that's the case then why are there several guys fawning over her? (And, according to Meyer, one of them is a teacher... um, ew). Bella is a Mary Sue, simple as that. And I hate Mary Sues.Edward- Okay, this boy is just way too possessive and stalkerish (it is not romantic of him to sneak into Bella's room and watch her sleep! It's creepy and wrong!) Oh, and ""bad boys"" usually don't sit there and say ""I'm dangerous, stay away"" etc. all the time... I also hated the fact that Bella described some part of his body every other page. It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Okay, we get the fact that he's hot, Bella... now MOVE ON! I could go on and on about all the characters... every single one of them was a flat, cardboard cut-out that did not seem realistic at all.2. Writing style:Purple Prose- Ew... to this... seriously, all the purple prose made me want to throw the book across the room. Enough said. 3. Descriptions:I know I said up there that I got sick of reading about how gorgeous some part of Edward's body was every other paragraph... and if that wasn't bad enough... what's worse than is the fact that even with all that unnecessary description of him and everyone else (though mostly him, since Bella is that shallow) I still had a hard time picturing him or any of the characters in my head, for that matter. I also had a hard time picturing a lot of the setting and the action in my head as well. It's kind of sad really... there was so much description, you would think that everything (Edward especially) would be embedded into my brain, but no. That's what makes me wonder why so many fans find Edward so ""hot"", I never got a clear picture of him in my head to even begin to form an opinion about whether he was ""hot"" or not.Seriously, Meyer completely abused the dictionary and the thesaurus while writing this book (so much so that I think she should never be allowed to look at either one ever again)... there are so many big descriptive words used that could be replaced by smaller words that look and sound better. Half the time the words that she does use doesn't really go with what she's trying to say. Simply put: Stephenie Meyer is a moron and doesn't know that when writing you are supposed to use the thesaurus sparingly (aka: only when it is truly needed and not any time you damn well please), it really ruins everything if it's used too much... as Meyer has perfectly portrayed with this atrocious book.4. Plot:Okay, the plot gets it's own category because it pissed me off so much. I mean, seriously... where was it?! It was nothing but sappy, gag worthy fluff between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something finally happened. And, even then... it went by so fast and was not explained well at all (since Bella conveniently fainted during it, which is such a cop out). It seemed to me that Meyer just threw it in there, and it was only put there in the first place, so that she could point at it and say, ""Look, there's a plot right there."", when people like me came around and said otherwise. But that's not a plot!! The plot should not take 400 pages to start! And no the whole ""romance"" between Bella and Edward is not the plot! This is especially the case since we knew from the beginning... thanks to the moronic give away on the back cover that states that Bella and Edward were going to fall in love... speaking of that, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give away the fact that Edward was a vampire on the back cover?! I mean... really?! That took away any suspense/mystery the book might have had for the reader about what he was... so, while Bella was stupidly wondering what he was, I was sitting there yelling at her for being such a moron and not seeing what was right in front of her.5. Plot holes The one thing that drove me absolutely CRAZY was the the fact that no one in the small town of Forks noticed that the Cullens never aged! And the ""children"" never graduated and went on to college. I mean, if they've been there for more than four years, than I'm assuming that someone would have noticed! I mean, the town could not be full of that many morons! (Okay... I've been told several times that Cullens have only been living in Forks for about two years... I guess all the purple prose distracted me from reading and remembering that little detail...) Speaking of school, why in the world would they willingly choose to take high school over and over again? Especially since they all have several college degrees (which leads me to wonder why, since they are so ""human loving"" they can't do something useful with their education like Carlisle, instead of sitting on their butts all day and just being useless) I know they need to ""fit in"", but seriously.. . that's just stupid... they could always pretend that they're home schooled (it's not that uncommon these days). Since that's how the Cullens fit into society, that means they have to move every four or five years to avoid suspicion, right? Wow... that must really suck. However, they wouldn't have to do that if they didn't put the younger ones in school since if they were in the workforce (and being useful to society) then they could stay for a lot longer before people started wondering why they don't age. But, I think I know why Edward and his ""siblings"" tortured themselves day after day by going to high school... Stephenie Meyer wasn't creative enough to come up with any other way for Edward and Bella to meet. It would have made more sense for them to have been neighbors or something. I can come up with several nice ideas about how that would have turned out and it would have been much better.I've been told that there are more, but those are the two that really bugged me. Though, I love the fans response to the mention of any plot hole (the rabid ones, not the sane ones, of course). It usually goes like this: ""Well it is a fictional vampire book."" That's a stupid reason. Just because it's a book with vampires doesn't mean it's exempt from having to be realistic and not having glaring plot holes.I've also been told that there are even more in later books, but I'm not about to torture myself by reading the rest of the series just to find them and list them... I have better things to do with my time... like reading books that are actually good and not a waste of my time or money.6. VampiresLike I said before, I'm a big vampire fan. But, this book is an embarrassment to vampire fiction. The vampires are pathetic, sweet, innocent, almost ""misunderstood"" creatures. I know that Meyer has every right to create her own idea about vampires. And, to be honest, I was okay with her idea about vampires until they started sparkling. VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE! To have them sparkle takes away the evilness of the myth of the creatures (since, they are creatures of the devil...at least, originally, they were). Evil creatures do not sparkle, the idea's laughable at best. Most normal people are not scared of something that sparkles in the sun. I mean, I know if I saw someone sparkling; I would not immediately think ""vampire"" and run. Not only because I don't associate sparkling with vampires, but also because how the hell is sparkling evil or scary?! By the way, the whole sparkling vampire idea just seemed to be there because Meyer wanted a reason as to why the vampires could even walk around in the daylight to begin with. The idea was just a convenient way for her to write the vampires. Since, she's incapable of coming up with a better, much more creative idea. I don't mind the fact that they could come out during the day (since that's not unheard of in vampire fiction nowadays), but I wish that Meyer had come up with a better idea that didn't make me laugh uncontrollably at the thought. All the other myths about vampires are nonexistent. Holy water and garlic won't bother them (just like the sun), stake through the heart won't kill them either, even beheading them won't get rid of them. She made her vampires practically invincible (which is annoying). The only way to really kill one of her vampires is to rip it apart and burn the pieces or to blow it up. Two things that a human would have a hard time doing... which, makes me wonder why, if they're so invincible, they live in secrecy? Especially since (from my knowledge) most vampires don't live like the Cullens, they could careless about humans. If most other vampires were so cruel, why don't they come out to humanity and take over? It makes a lot more sense since a mere human would have a very difficult time killing just one vampire. The fact that they had no weaknesses annoyed the crap out of me. Along with being almost invincible, they all had these special ""powers"", but they didn't have the bad side effects with them, only the good. All in all, her vampires were perfect.I don't like my vampires to be blood thirsty monsters that kill everything in sight. But, I also don't want them to be so pathetic and innocent either. The only two vampiric qualities that are there are the ones that are well known among everyone: drinking blood (well, sort of since the Cullens are ""vegetarian"" vampires; an idea that seriously made me laugh) and being immortal. Otherwise, the Cullens are disgustingly human like.I think the thing I have the problem with the most is the fact that Meyer has never seen any vampire movies/t.v. shows or read any vampire novels. There's this saying in regards to writing: ""Write what you know"". Stephenie Meyer knew nothing about vampires when she wrote this horrible excuse for a vampire novel (which is probably why it was so awful in comparison to other vampire novels, whether those books are in the romance section of the bookstore or the horror/sci-fi section). A good author always does their research (whether it's fiction or non-fiction is irrelevant). This doesn't mean that she needed to go by the other myths, it just means that she should have done a little research to see what she was getting herself into. If she had done this, I would have been able to respect her ideas more because at least then she would have done her research. Where the vampires are concerned, this novel is an embarrassment to vampire/supernatural fiction.7. MessagesI am somewhat appalled at the messages that this book sends out.. they are so anti-feminist, it's disgusting:1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you. (All Bella wants is to be with Edward, some aspirations, huh?)2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot. (Bella goes on and on and on about how hot some part of Edward is every other page)3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are so very important. (Mike and Eric pretty much say the same thing to Bella on her first day of school, but she's nicer to Mike than Eric because the latter wasn't very attractive. Also, she picks Edward because of his looks as well)4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night (before you even know him all that well)... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. (It's completely disgusting to hear girls talk about this. They swoon and gush about how romantic it is... seriously, what is wrong with people these days?!)5. It is perfectly okay to become completely obsessed with your boyfriend and depend on him for everything.(Bella's obsession and dependence on Edward sets feminism back a couple hundred years or so)6. It also teaches that not only is it okay to change yourself for a guy, but it's also okay to give up EVERYTHING for him as well. (Bella wants to become a vampire and leave her family and friends to be with Edward. What. The. Hell.)7. Your life is not complete until you find a man. (This is nothing but a LIE. Girls do not need a man to be complete)Like with the plot holes, I've been told that there are many more terrible messages in later books and once again, I'm not about to go out and read the books. However, I will say this... from what I've heard, they sound worse than the ones I've already listed.8. The Obsession:Well, this gets its own category, mostly because I just don't understand what all the obsession is over... it's a book, and a poorly written one at that. I run across girls all the time arguing over who Edward ""belongs"" to... it's pathetic and kind of scary. He's a book character... he doesn't belong to anyone, but Meyer, since she's the one who created him.I also hate the fact that I can't go into the book store now without being bombarded with a huge display dedicated to this crappy series... makes me sick to see such praise and popularity for a mediocre book series when there are so much better authors out there that are virtually ignored since they write real fiction and none of this poorly written wish fulfillment fantasy crap.This was obviously a fulfillment story that I would expect a preteen to write on her livejournal. This is not a book I would expect a thirty something year old woman with a college education to write and actually attempt and then succeed in getting published. And, it was a degree in English... seriously, I would have expected much better from someone who had that degree... since she spent college studying books and analyzing them etc. you would think that she would know how to write one the proper way...Meyer could have made this book great, but no... instead she took the easy way out: a cliched, simple, overused plot and added vampires to it(as if that made it any different).Honestly, I've read better over on fictionpress.com... and that's really sad, because most of the authors over there are between the ages of 14 and 26 and are amateurs in the field. Maybe, if Meyer had posted this up there first, it would have been a much better story because the good writers over there would have set her straight. Maybe then, I would have been able to get through the novel, because it might have actually been good!And, oh just for the record... Twilight is NOT the next Harry Potter, nor is it better than Harry Potter... I say that not only because JK Rowling actually has talent, but also because they are in completely different genres and can't really be compared.Though, it does make me sick to see Harry Potter even mentioned in the same sentence as this piece of crap... (unfortunately, that couldn't be avoided in this review) and it's an insult to JK Rowling to have her amazing writing compared to the horrible writing of Stephenie Meyer.EDIT: I found this site, and thought I should share with everyone: http://reasoningwithvampires.tumblr.c...The creator of the above site has scanned copies of the Twilight books on to her computer and has taken it upon herself to point out the many issues that the books have (these are mostly grammatical in nature). If you are a fangirl who believes that Twilight is perfect and has no flaws then you should really take a look at this.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",1.0
411,The Unhoneymooners,,3.92,"['May', '14,', '2019']","Here are two true statements about me:1) While I have never actually liked a Christina Lauren book, I really want to, and I keep trying to.2) I love The Hating Game. (Update: I no longer love The Hating Game. But let's pretend for the sake of me not having to update this review that I do._Here is a statement about this book I believe to be true:1) It is just a worse The Hating Game.To be fair, most Christina Lauren books are just a worse The Hating Game. (In my opinion, that is. Because for reasons unknown I love The Hating Game.)I mean. Here, we have Olive, the adorkable, cringey heroine who Doesn’t Know She Is Beautiful But Does Know She Is Physically Sexy (because that’s definitely different from a woman being valued only for sexual purposes). She’s paired with Ethan, the cold and mean (but so hot and omg his ABS) guy who is actually sooooo nice once you get to know him and all those times he was a total asshole? Just a misunderstanding. Well I mean it staaaarted a misunderstanding, but then the girl was like, so mean to him (and also so sexy, he was distracted by her boobs / butt / legs can you blame him), so then he just HAD to be a mean vengeful child about it for literally years on end!Essentially The Hating Game.And I have to tell you, I’m getting realllllll sick of this trope. It’s just childish bickering teeming with misunderstandings then sexy time then a major misunderstanding then make-up sexy time and finally, mercifully, The End.I like The Hating Game, though, because it’s charming and I found the romance believable. Not only was I not charmed by this book, not only did I not find the romance believable, but...well.Let’s do a list.1) The Huge Misunderstanding That Threatens To Ruin Everything Even True Love is very, very stupid. Putting this point in spoiler tags: Our protagonist, Olive, has a twin, Ami, who is married to Ethan’s brother, whose name I couldn’t remember if you paid me. I had to look up everyone else’s names in the synopsis. Anyway, Ethan’s brother - let’s call him Stupid Jock With No Traits Who Doesn’t Matter, Jock for short - comes onto Olive in a super creepy way, and when she tells Ami and Ethan about it, they both accuse her of lying. In spite of the fact that, supposedly, they both love her in respective once-in-a-lifetime level bonds. There is literally no reason for them to think she’s lying and to believe Jock, who is sh*tty and gross, but they do. Because drama.2) There’s such a halfhearted subplot for Olive about her needing a DREAM CAREER. One of the first things we learn about her (after the first round of the countless descriptions of her sexy curvy body) is that she genuinely enjoys her career path and is good at it. But for some reason...that is not a dream career? Am I an emotionless robot for not understanding that? The rest of the book is teeming with Motivational Passages from Ethan and Olive’s internal monologue about her Not Settling and Finding Herself and I just...don’t get it.3) The way the world works in this book feels completely unfamiliar to me. Like, Olive’s twin Ami pays for her entire wedding - venue, food, dress, hotel, honeymoon, everything - with...coupons? What? That’s not a thing. Olive gets fired for a reason solely related to her personal life, which makes no sense. Everyone believes there’s such a thing as a definitively good or bad luck? What. Where are we. What’s going on.But worst of all...I didn’t care about this at all. Where was the CHEMISTRY. Where was the CHARM. Where was the part where I FALL in LOVE and also they FALL in LOVE.Why am I reading a rom-com and feeling neither ROM nor COM.Bottom line: Will I keep reading Christina Lauren books? Who’s to say. (Probably.) (But then, that’s the masochism talking.)----------pre-reviewCALLED ITreview to come / 2.5ish stars----------tbr reviewi am probably not going to like this book but by god i won't let that stop me",2.0
412,The Kiss Quotient,A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.,3.90,"['June', '5,', '2018']","This book had the nerve, the audacity, and the unmitigated gall to come into my home where I pay the bills… and let me down.On the bright side, however, at least it’s not a Percy Jackson movie.I have so many issues with this book. But let me discuss first the brief list of things I liked about it: the fact that this is the book version of Pretty Women but with a refreshing subversive twist that’s embodied in the gender role reversal; the honest and clear-eyed exploration of money and how fortune does not touch everyone with the same hand; how there’s a real sense of culture and history in the depiction of Michael’s community (his Vietnamese heritage shines through and there's tremendous joy in his interactions with his family: the banter, the support, the kindness threaded through ruthless teasing); and the knowledge that the events in this book and the author’s continued research has inspired her to seek out a therapist and be diagnosed on the spectrum. It's very important to see autistic women at the forefront of efforts at representation, expanding the conversation and the vision for autistic characters.I really wanted to love this book. But it was, quite frankly, boring, averagely written, and riddled with clichés. But what grates at me the most is the way The Kiss Quotient demonstrates great knowledge of vital issues only to overshadow the significance of its premise by refusing to delve deeper into something more nuanced and thoughtful. I expected more from this; more thoughtfulness, more artfulness, more craft. Instead, I was left uncertain how to feel about the whole thing—about an ending that felt easy and trivial, almost mocking the seriousness of the rest of the book, and a fizz of uneasiness that I couldn’t quite shake afterwards.This is the story of a woman who is smart and beautiful and accomplished and who simply has had the poor misfortune of coming across men who had never cared for more than their own entertainment, who didn’t have her welfare anywhere remotely near at heart, and who treated her either like a boring convenience or an exciting toy. So, she stood there and accepted the weight of the blame, because clearly, if someone hurt you, there’s something wrong with you to deserve it. For Stella, it is her autism.If it were obvious and unmistakable at any point in the book that the author was highlighting this attitude as a problem, I might feel more kindly disposed toward it. Instead, it’s almost positioning autism as an inherent flaw that you’re supposed to overcome, and showcasing the love interest, Michael, as someone who will, and I quote, “seduce [perhaps more aptly termed in this context: fuck] the anxiety out of [Stella]”, failing throughout to properly examine the crucial fact that Stella’s past sexual encounters didn’t go awry because of her autism. Not at all: her past dates are simply pieces of shit who didn’t treat her like a human being. And then, Michael comes along, shows Stella the barest scrapings of human decency, and she feeds off that because she’s been starving and thought such crumbs a feast. It’s like the novel version of those cishetero dating articles whose basic premise is “Ladies, Here Are 10 Tips to Make Men Treat You Like a Human Being.”This is a frustration exacerbated by the fact that once Stella establishes that she enjoys physical contact with a man (read: a man who treats her decently and who doesn’t leave her laying on the bed like an unloved doll splayed out on the floor), she suggests that they now forgo the sex altogether and work together to figure out how to make her comfortable in romantic situations, and so begins a fake-relationship which of course blossoms into a romance.I fault this book for trying to depict a well-balanced pairing only to deploy it in ways that feel manipulative and disingenuous. The bar was already set so low for Michael…and yet, he still managed to slide right under it. Michael says all the right things to make Stella feel comfortable, but his words stand in blatant contrast against his actions—which are infuriatingly manipulative and alarming. For instance, when Stella clearly voices her discomfort with something, Michael sweeps aside her comments like you’d brush crumbs from a table and assures her that she’ll enjoy it when she tries it, and of course, she does—her agency completely disregarded by this point. In moments like these, the relentless patronizing Michael is subtly practicing left a deeper impression than anything else, and I couldn't just chalk it up to character unreliability. It made me want to furiously wave my fist at the book in outrage.Also egregious is how Stella’s symptoms seem to conveniently disappear around Michael. In fact, it is pretty obvious early on that the narrative is charitably embellishing Michael’s traits, palliating his possessiveness and elevating his character only by villainizing literally every single other male character. This is made even more manifest in the second love interest, Philip, Stella’s coworker, who is painstakingly one-dimensional: he’s an unmitigated jerk. That’s it. That’s the extent of his contribution. I can’t overstate how exhausted I am of this trope. If the romance in your book only works because every single character who’s not the potential love interest is even more of an unbearable asshole, that's just not it.Speaking of unbearable assholes, there is a particular scene early in the novel that almost made me DNF: Philip comes into Stella’s office, casually asks her if she’s a virgin and gives an unsolicited advice from “a man who’s been around the block a few times” (I rolled my eyes so far back I could see the last of my brain cells dying). His advice is that if she goes out and fucks a lot more men, she’d be more experienced and have more luck. The entire scene is howling “sexual harassment in a workplace” and the fact that this whole encounter is just... simply glossed over in a ""oh well, boys-will-be-boys"" kind of way still strikes a sour note.At the bottom of everything, that's really my problem with this book as whole: its frustrating refusal to explore and thoroughly examine so many important themes and ideas in favoe of escalating a plot that keeps a very tight, narrow focus on a romance with really questionable dynamics. I know a lot of readers felt differently about this book and will not agree, and that's fine! Regardless of my experience of this novel, I believe books like The Kiss Quotient are important for their capacity to help improve awareness and diagnosis rates for a community that's undeniably under-represented, and I really hope to see a greater plurality of representation for autism in this genre, and all genres.",2.0
413,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,,4.42,"['June', '13,', '2017']","5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the 
Outlander
 and 
Ross Poldark
 kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!",5.0
414,Ugly Love,,4.05,"['August', '5,', '2014']","1.75 stars ✩⋆oops this is awkward. i know this is a beloved CoHo book and yes, i loved this back then when i first read it but rereading it now i- don't look at me.my reading taste have changed oookay? i might have overlooked every shitty thing back then but now that i'm more petty, have the penchant for holding a grudge, and have high standards for books ooohh boy. ✧ 
what is this about?
↳ okay so this is about Miles and Rachel oops sorry, i meant Tate and Miles. Miles being Tate's brother's best friend and Tate being Miles' therapist, ugh sorry, i meant friends with benefits person and the whole time she was hoping he would change his mind because duh she's falling for him while Miles just implicitly leads her on even though he's clear about his rules and pushes her away the whole damn time because of his past but he won't stop their little arrangement because our mans is horny as fuck.also, Miles is a pilot. this is an important fact. ALSO also, this is not Tate and Miles' story- this is Tate + Miles and Rachel's story. i read this years ago and the only things i remember is that Miles got horny while he was wearing swim shorts? (idfk why i remember this don't ask), Miles and Rachel's shower scene (again, idfk why i remember this but i wish i can unsee it thank you very much), and then the Nick Bateman trailer??anyways, that's all i remember and i know, they're all irrelevant but do you know what i forgot?? huh? do you? DO YOU??! well, if you've read this then you can probably guess what i didn't remember because HOLY SHIT- the scene at the end. guys... GUYS. What. The. Fuck.i was speechless- S-P-E-E-C-H-L-E-S-S. i canNOT believe i forgot that scene holy shit. the anger. the annoyance- the fucking rage that i felt when i read that oh my god. anyways, i'm ranting again and y'all know the drill so,･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･ 
SPOILERS AHEAD
 ･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．⤅ dislike #1: Miles' povyou know what, i'm gonna be straight to the point: MILES SEEMED MORE IN LOVE WITH RACHEL. or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it was that intense. now, now. lemme explain.the problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking ✨ s h a k e s p e a r e ✨ 
She doesn't realize she's everywhere She's in everything Everysingle thing has just become Rachel, It's consuming me.My thoughts aren't thoughts anymore.My thoughts are Rachel.I can't fall in love with you, Rachel.I look at the sink. I want to look at Rachel.I breathe in air. I want to breathe in Rachel.I close my eyes. I only see Rachel.I wash my hands. I want to touch Rachel.
do y'all see this ⤴ ? this is the type of thing i wanted to see from Miles' pov when he's talking about Tate NOT Rachel but we never got to see this until the very end. and then when we get to the present chapters it's 98% in Tate's pov where we see her falling in love with Miles and this is annoying to me because seeing Miles treat Rachel like a goddess in his past chapters and then Miles being a little dickhead in Tate's chapters ugh-energy? not m a t c h e d.and with most of Miles' pov being in the past and falling in love with Rachel, obviously i couldn't help but compare and overanalyze every single thing and think he seems more in love with Rachel. and the thing that annoys me the most is that Tate's present pov and Miles' pov alternates so whenever we read Tate and Miles' romantic progression, the next chapter is Miles being so deeply in love with another woman, it's just...i could've done with just one past Miles pov instead of making it every second chapter or making it 50% of the whole content and showing the way he fell in love sooOOoooOo deeply with Rachel instead of just having 1-2 chapters of his pov about Tate, who's the actual heroine of the book. it's just so bleh and icky the whole time she felt like second best for me and i just felt bad. i know i've always complained about telling >>> showing in other books but this is the only time i'll ever accept all tell, no show.⤅ dislike #2: i can't with the doormat behaviorwhat makes everything more annoying is how Tate just lets him use her for sex and forgives him way too easily all the damn time like bish NO make him work for it for once and stop being a doormat it's annoying (yes, i know i've said the word annoying one too many times but that's how i felt 99.9% of the book OK).
“If any other man ever treated me like he did, it would be the one and only time. I don’t put up with the things I’ve seen a lot of my friends put up with. However, I find myself continuing to make excuses for him, like something could actually justify his actions last week.”
ma'am pLS-the whole time i was just yelling at her, 
TATE, YOU ARE NOT HIS THERAPIST
. ugh this pissed me off so much i couldn't even cheer for their romance because Miles was eh and honestly had no redeeming qualities in the present and then reading about his past pov being all in love with Rachel and in the present he just uses Tate for sex and pushes her away quite rudely all the damn time is, again, A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G.⤅ dislike #3: repetitive romanceno seriously. all they ever did was have sex, Tate hoping he would renege his rules and tell her that he does indeed love her and want a relationship with her, Miles pushing her away, Tate forgives him and then they fuck. repeat.⤅ dislike #4: pain. just- P A I Nand then- AND THEN i was just reading Tate and Miles' repetitive interactions where i thought the same shit would happen again and again in peace but THEEENNN.........hold on, lemme just give y'all a moment to breathe.......are you ready? OK
""My God, Rachel.""
um excuse me- you're probably wondering, mel, did he really say his ex's name, his ex who we've been reading about in his past chapters and won't shut up about how much he loves this other woman, while having sex with Tate?? well, i don't know let's look at the quote again shall we? are you guys ready?
He pulls out, then thrusts inside me again, this time with all his strength. It hurts.Give me your pain, Miles.""MY GOD, RACHEL.""My God, Rachel...Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
there. did y'all see that? okay? good. now, not gonna lie with you guys, this one HURT. when i read this scene i didn't know how to feel to be honest. was i shocked? appalled? speechless as fuck? all of the above?? yes. now with this scene, my annoyance reached its peak and is higher than the fucking stratosphere because why you ask? well, it's because there is NO GROVELING!! Tate leaves, Miles lets her go and says it's hard to feel bad for her because she's never felt real pain, then goes to Rachel for closure, goes to Tate and explains his past vaguely and all is forgiven???i'm pretty sure this is where my hatred for hero fucks up so bad but heroine forgives them after one speech trope came from. now, some might say that he gets a pass because of his sad past- because it really was sad by the way - but you see, for the majority of the book we've been reading about how Miles fought for and loved Rachel, and Tate fought for and loved Miles, for once i wanted to see him fighting for Tate but we never got to see that because again, there is 
NO. GROVELING.
───── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ─────i can't believe i rated this 5 stars back then. i don't know who pre 2019 mel is. we don't know her.honestly, because of the ending, i was this close to rating this 1 star because that's how annoyed i was with everyone but i felt generous today so. as always, i liked the emotional writing and how i can feel the longing and passion between Tate and Miles when they're having sex, the whole ""ugly love"" message, and learning about Miles' past and why he's the way he is?? it was so sad. but overall, everyone annoyed the f outta me (except for Cap- he's the best character in this book), this is basically Miles and Rachel's story, and the ending was unsatisfying as fuck.* * *original rating (july 2015) ── 5 stars",2.0
415,Me Before You,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Giver of Stars, discover the love story that captured over 20 million hearts in Me Before You, After You, and Still Me.",4.26,"['December', '31,', '2012']","I had a hard time rating this book one star, because up until the end I really liked it. But the end is the most important part of every book because it's what stays with you and after that I just can't bring myself to rate it anything but ""did not like it"".I am honestly shocked after reading all those 5* reviews. Not because people liked the book, but because people somehow manage to get something ""inspirational"" and romantic out of it... Seriously? I don't want to judge people for their opinion, but that's just disturbing. ---------Spoilers ahead-------------------Before I start, I want to say that I don't dislike this book because I'm strictly against any and every form of assisted suicide. It's a difficult subject with some valid arguments on both sides - in some cases, at least. I also don't have a problem with sad endings. I have different reasons for disliking it.Like a lot of people, I cried at the end of this book, but unlike probably most, not out of sadness, but out of anger. God, I was angry...Then I get on here and I see people quoting the book:""Some mistakes... Just have greater consequences than others. But you don't have to let the result of one mistake be the thing that defines you. You, Clark, have the choice not to let that happen.”""You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible.” ""Just live well. Just live.""How inspirational. Only... then Will basically drags all the meaning out of those quotes by deciding that this all applied to Lou, but not to himself.Why does he have to let his disability define him? He tells her to ""Just live."" but it's okay for him to ""Just die.""?""Live boldly. Push yourself. Don’t settle.""What if Lou was happy with a simple life in a small town and a loving family? Is it really better to never settle than try to actually be happy with what you have?""The thing is, I get that this could be a good life. I get that with you around, perhaps it could even be a very good life. But it's not my life. It's nothing like the life I want. Not even close. I loved my life, Clark. Really loved it. I loved my job, my travels, the things I was. I loved being a physical person. I liked riding my motorbike, hurling myself off buildings. I liked crushing people in business deals. I liked having sex. Lots of sex. I led a big life. I am not designed to exist in this thing - and yet for all intents and purposes it's now the thing that defines me. It is the only thing that defines me.""Oookay... What? The f*?So it could be a very good life. But it's just not good enough for me. So, all the people who love me, go to hell, and I'm going to die. Because I just won't settle for less than perfect.I would have had an easier time understanding the book if he had been miserable until the end. If the book had showed us that his life really was miserable and he couldn't go on, it would have been incredibely sad and depressing (still entirely unromantic), but I would get that. Let him die of pneumonia. That would be sad, but at least it wouldn't send such a disturbing message.As it is, the book spends two thirds showing us that they can actually have happy moments and that he can actually love and be happy. But it's just not enough. Because: Don't settle.Now, I'm not claiming to even remotely be able to imagine what Will must feel like or how difficult his life is - but there are thousands of people out there, who live very difficult lives and still manage to be happy or at least try. I have a very deep respect for those people. But Will can't be happy or try because he can no longer go to Paris and go skiing and do all those super-amazing things he did in his life before - and just enjoying music, loving and being loved simply won't do. It just seemes to me like the overall message of the book is a very shallow one for this.Another thing, that makes me a little mad, is how in the book he says something like: dying is the first time he's actually made his own decision since the accident (or something along those lines).This just blows my mind! You don't lose all your choices because you can't move your legs and arms. He made tons of choices during the course of the book. He chose to be rude to Lou, he chose to be nice to Lou, he chose not to go out, he chose to go out, he chose to go to Alicia's wedding, he chose to go to Mauritius... All those things weren't his choices? He also had a lot more choices, considering all the money they had - yes, he was very limited in some ""choices"", but that doesn't mean he didn't have any.So, no, dying wasn't the first time he made his own choice. What it was, was the last time he made any choice. It wasn't the accident that took away all of his choices, it was deciding to die. And that's not brave, let alone romantic. It completely blows my mind that there are people reviewing this who found that ending romantic - I'm not sure how romantic you would find it if the person you loved wanted to commit suicide... Also, it was incredibly selfish. Will didn't just make a choice for his life, he made one for the people he loved and who loved him. And no matter how unpopular that opinion may be in today's super-individualistic world that sees self-fulfillment as the highest achievable goal, I actually believe that our duty not to hurt the people we love is - in general - a little more important than the duty to ""live our life as fully as possible.""""I liked riding my motorbike, hurling myself off buildings. I liked crushing people in business deals. I liked having sex. Lots of sex. I led a big life.""Maybe this explains it. Maybe Will is just an incredibly shallow person. He didn't really feel like that to me for large stretches of the book, but maybe that's just it. And maybe that's what made me so angry.___P.S.: There's been some controversy about the story in connection with the release of the movie, and since I've discussed this a little in the comments, I thought I'd add a few notes into the body of the review as well - on why the message this story sends is so problematic.Starting with what the message actually is: I don't think the author intended to tell us that a disabled life is not worth living and I would never accuse her of that. She made an effort to show that Will's life could be a good life and I have a feeling most readers understood that. The problematic part comes in where she presents it as a (psychologically) normal thing for him to still want to die. This reenforces very dangerous assumptions society already has about people with disabilities. Many (able bodied) people have commented that they completely understand Will and if they were in his position they'd want to die too. They are wrong. And I can say this, because there is actual data on this - the vast majority of people with similar disabilities as Will do not want to die. They adjust - with time and the right support and treatment.So when a disabled person has suicidal thoughts it is not our duty as a society to ""empower"" them to take their own life. It's our duty to give them the best possible care, treatment and support so they stop being suicidal.One argument frequently brought up is that this is the story of just one man. That it's not meant to be representative of all disabled people. While this may be a valid argument for any single story, the problem remains that these kinds of stories are vastly overrepresented in mainstream media. When was the last time a major Hollywood movie featured a quadriplegic lead character who didn't want to die? When you're creating content that has such an impact on such a gigantic audience, you cannot flinch from the responsibility of the message you're sending by claiming that it's ""just one story"". It isn't just one story. You're influencing people's opinions about disability and suicide on a huge scale. And you're doing it in the worst possible way.",1.0
416,Fifty Shades of Grey,This book is intended for mature audiences.,3.66,"['May', '25,', '2011']","You know, I was beginning to wonder if I needed to change some of my two star books to one star. I was thinking that I might not ever personally read a book worthy of one star, and I was messing up my scale by giving some of the more lame books I've read lately two stars instead of one.Thank you E.L. James, for proving to me there was something worth waiting for. Something that truly exemplifies the meaning of terrible.Now hold up, all you would-be defenders. I read this whole thing. I did not skip anything, I did not skim, I read every word. I bought this book with the intention of giving it the benefit of the doubt. You see, I love erotica, and I'm not ashamed to say that I both read (as you see on my 2012 books I've already read two others) and write it myself. So I was thinking to myself, oh, maybe there's a possibility that even though this is a twi-fiction rewrite, and even though everyone makes fun of it, it could still be a fun little guilty-pleasure read that I can laugh along with.NO.NO.NO.NO.This book is NOT:- erotic/sexy- funny, even ironically- endearing- full of sexual taboosThis book IS:- repetitive- plotless (well, you knew that)- painful to get through- depicting manipulative, controlling, and self-destructive as desirable- how to not write a novel- how to gain success by using other people's characters, barely changing them and then laughing all the way to the bankMost people know about the twilight matchups so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was actually quite sickening, how lazy she was to change ANY story details:Bella Anastasia, a clumsy girl who grew up in Arizona Las Vegas with her mother, then moved to Forks Vancouver, Washington where her dad stepdad lives, while her mother lives with her new husband in Florida Georgia. She has a younger friend named Jacob Jose with a crush on her, and whose dad is friends with her dad, because they are fishing partners and police force army buddies, and who gave her his old truck VW beetle.Edward Christian, who is adopted and has a sibling named Emmett Elliott and a sister named Alice Mia, also adopted, who live with their parents Carlisle Carrick (really? CARRICK? We couldn't even change the first three letters?) and Esme Grace. Their father mother is a doctor. Rose Kate and Jasper Ethan are also siblings in this story, but have been changed to be friends of Anastasia, since in Twilight they already have a convenient different last name than the other Cullens.Also, he 'dazzles' her.I can't even function over the fact that upon preparing this book for publishing she couldn't change one fucking thing to make it even remotely different. That was too hard. TOO DAMN HARD. The similarities in character are so untouched that I am sincerely appalled that she thought it 'different' enough to publish as is. It's quite disgusting.Alright, continuing on, and once again, I'm sure you've heard this already: this book is terribly written. Most notably the lack of ability to describe anything other than the few choice phrases she knows how to type. He ran his hands through his hair. I bit my lip. He told me not to bite my lip. Oh jeez. He grabbed me by the chin to make me look up at him. Holy crap. I peeked up at him. Lather rinse repeat. Over. And over. And over. For 500 pages. Then there's the case of multiple personality disorder, where she hears the voices of two distinct other pieces of herself in her head. The subconscious, the one telling her she's not good enough, and the inner goddess, the one that's all into the sex. It's strange because I'm also currently reading a book right now, Deadline, where the main character hears a voice in his head because he is literally insane, and it's written almost the exact same way, he talks back to his voice, who presents herself in italics, just as Anastasia talks back to her two italics voices. It's funny because she's supposed to be completely normal, and yet shares the same schizophrenic tendencies as a book about someone who is completely insane. This is sense. Check out this awesome short paragraph from chapter 24:“Through the haze of light, I squint and see Christian leaning over me, smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.”What are these fragments, four in a row. What is this punctuation. GASP AT HIM BEING CLOTHED. Is this supposed to be poetry?Let me add some line breaks for poetic interest:Through the haze of light, I squint and see ,Christian leaning over me, Smiling. Amused. Amused at me. Dressed! In black.That's almost better.Let's have another, shall we, from chapter 24 once more:“I didn't put that song on my iPod,” he says casually, and puts his foot down so that I am thrown back into my seat as the car accelerates along the freeway.What? He knows what he's doing, the bastard. Who did? And I have to listen to Britney going on and on. Who...who?The song ends and the iPod shuffles to Damien Rice being morunful. Who? Who? I stare out the window, my stomach churning. Who?SAY WHO AGAIN, BITCH. JUST TRY IT, I DARE YOU.Okay and now, maybe even worse than the writing (oh hell, nothing's worse than the writing, nevermind) is the lack of plot. Now once again, you already know this. Do I even need to tell you nothing happens? Seeing as it's based off of a book where nothing happens, you can be guaranteed that as we go one step removed, even less happens. Here is the part where I apologize to Twilight, where I said, in my page by page commentary below, that 50 Shades was more entertaining. I was at the very beginning. I was young and naïve. I didn't realize. I'm sorry. You know how The Office kind of got bad after Jim and Pam got together, because there was really nothing you were waiting for after that? This happens by like...chapter 2. You're like...okay....what, now we jut have to watch them whine as a couple for the next zillion pages? Okay. I can't even fathom that there are two other books written about this couple. I literally want to open the window and invite birds to eat my eyes out as punishment for buying and reading this book.And now for a bit of tiddlybits, I'm going to share some information on storywriting that you guys might find interesting, and will help show exactly why 50 Shades has zero plot. I went to school for film, and we had story development classes. One thing we were beaten over the head with about is something called the 7 Sentence Story. This will help for any writers that are writing their books to be cinematic or would like their novel to be considered for film purposes (this is by no means a rule, but a really helpful guideline). First, you need a problem, a conflict. A reason to tell a story. Once you have that, your plot should be able to be described in seven sentences thusly:Exposition: we are introduced to the protagonist and/or main charactersInciting Incident: something happens that kicks off the conflict, the whole point of the storyPlot Point 1: because of the inciting incident, character sets off to do something/correct the problem, etcMidpoint: here in film you might see a montage, but it's a place where either plot point 1 is resolved or there is a transition in the characters way of thinkingPlot Point 2: often an even bigger issue arises, or a twist that changes or accelerates the conflictClimax: final showdown or decisions needed to be madeResolution.: everything comes to an end, the conflict is settled in one way or anotherBasically, if you can tell your story in this way in seven sentences, you'll know that A) the main point is clear, B) that your story doesn't wander too much in different directions, and C) that you actually have a plot to stand on, that you can justify there's enough substance there. And since that's a lot of vagueness, we'll go with a classic captive/dominant story to show how one tells a story in seven sentences: Disney's Beauty and the Beast. First, the main conflict:Conflict: The prince has been turned into a beast and has only a limited time left before he is trapped forever as one.And the seven sentence story: Exposition: Belle is a smart girl who rejects the advances of Gaston, as she doesn't want to be stuck in a mundane life.Inciting Incident: Belle's father gets lost and captured by the Beast in his castle.Plot Point 1: Belle trades her freedom for her father and is prisoner in the castle.Midpoint: Belle starts to experience feelings for the Beast and is complacent.Plot Point 2: Belle's father is sick, and the Beast decides to let her go, even though he's giving up his chances of being with her.Climax: Gaston comes with an angry mob to destroy the Beast.Resolution: While Beast lays dying, his love for Belle turns him back into a human and he can live with her happily ever after. Simple, right? Of course, other things happen, but no doubt you can communicate the main story with just these sentences. Okay, so let's try 50 Shades, which, hilariously, has had its film rights bought already. Conflict: Anastasia must decide whether to be with a guy who she thinks is super hot but also scares her (This fascinating decision, I tell you what.)Exposition: Anastasia is a literary student at WSU.Inciting Incident: Anastasia meets Christian on page 7, and thinks he's hot and mysterious and also frustrating. It is clear they both have chemistry.Plot Point 1, which is sloppy and all over the place: Christian chases her down, brings her to his house and shows her he's into S&M. Also they have sex.Sorta Midpoint, but kind of squished close to Plot Point 1: Anastasia must decide whether to pledge herself to him via contract if she wants to continue seeing him. Plot Point 2: Nah, she's still deciding and whining about how he's kind of scary but continues to have sex with him throughout this whole time. There is no plot point 2.Climax: Well there isn't really one, it's just kind of an all over the place ending...either the more complicated sex scene at the end with the hymnal music or him hitting with her with the belt the next morning, one of the two I guess...Resolution: She says he's too weird and ends it. What a complex, thrilling, and incredible plot full of depth. SHOULD I HAVE CUT THAT FOR SPOILERS? OOPS? Did you even care? If you've gotten this far, nope.But guess what. We know that there are two other books and they get together and lesson isn't really learned so AWESOME, COOL. I guess that's how she gets people to buy the next ones because hot diggedy I can't wait to see them get back together and whine some more.And let's talk about the sex for a moment. Nothing forbidden actually happens that you'll be like ohhhh how scandalous I want to try that. For the most part it's pretty much all basic stuff or basic toy play, because basically he's taking it easier on her since she's inexperienced. Except for the belt part at the end, I guess, which just doesn't sound fun.And you already heard about the tampon, so like, that's not even a surprise (although imo it's not a big deal anyway. Out of all the women having sex on their periods regularly, I can guarantee you there are quite a few men that are tasked with taking the tampon out and throwing it aside.) I was actually more upset about the fact that she is sleeping completely naked in a hotel room bed on day two of her period. As if that isn't going to be a mess in the morning.Okay lest I go on as long as the book, you get the point. If you want to see more, my commentary while reading it is below. However, a few things:-I cannot stand how much the author being middle aged shows from the point of view of this 21 year old. “I'm gonna buy plane tickets...on the Internet.” ARE YOU NOW? WHOAOOOAOAOA. Don't get crazy on us, I might be too overwhelmed by this turn of events. “I fired up my email.” BLAZING SPEEDS REQUIRED.-They actually do the “you hang up” “no you hang up” “no you” that gross couples tend to do. And it was, expectedly, gross.-Someone on ONTD who liked this book yelled at me because I said that Christian is not a dominant (they also said I wasn't 'experienced enough to understand,' lol okay, like you know who I am, anon.) I still stand by that statement. It's not what he's doing, it's how he's doing it. He is deeply troubled, whiny, and manipulative, and while he does love control, it's for the wrong reasons. He was abused as a child, and sexually abused as a 15 year old and vastly denies it, and because of this he justifies his activities as personal preference when he is in fact a bit too fucked up to currently have a relationship. He ends up making the naïve Anastasia batshit crazy because he continues to string her along, trying to convince her they want the same things, instead of getting himself some help.-He gives her the illusion that she has the choice to back out, but then turns around and says ha-ha I'm joking but I know where to find you by the way. She goes to visit her mother because she needs a break from him to think, and what does he do? Flies out there, using his roundabout stalker way of finding information about where she's at, like he always does, to meet up, have sex with her and take her out with him. She's supposed to be visiting her mother and having time to think, yet he can't stay away and makes this about HIM, taking her away from time with her mom whom she hasn't seen in 6 months. I can't at this selfish fucking bastard because he just can't stay away.It makes me mad just thinking about someone that clingy. Which is another thing that pisses me off, almost everything about their whining and relationship conversations reminds me of everything I've hated about past relationships I've had. How does ANYONE enjoy this book? How does anyone think that this is sexy, that this depicts something they want?I can't even.I cannot.(Also I should never have imagined Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl as the main characters. Now everytime I see a commercial for Gossip Girl, rage courses through my body.)I'm bored. Someone get me out of here.P.S. Did you know that James recently stated she's set the bar for writing pretty high?Cool.Please, do yourself a favor and go buy a book of much higher quality plot and writing, ohhhh like....Modelland.",1.0
417,Happy Place,A couple who broke up months ago make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.,4.01,"['April', '25,', '2023']","➸ 4.25 stars

”in every universe, it’s you for me. even if it’s not me for you.”

— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift. can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life! did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called “happy place” i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make you happy. the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm! — this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between a past and present timeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.

”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”

 — second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.— PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending. ↳ harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace, the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough* i also hate my job. her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.↳ wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters. ↳ 
wyn and harriet:
— i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another. — i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹

“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”

↳ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was that friendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>> — overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!! — but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!! no thoughts, just tears rn. EH, i will hunt you down for making me endure so much pain. rtc 😔❤️‍🩹──────────────────────────happy happy place release day to my emily henry girlies!! this is a big day for us all. now bring me the angst, pain and tears.",4.0
418,The Selection,,4.08,"['April', '24,', '2012']","UPDATE 3/23/2016: YOU GUYS. I owe Kiera Cass a TREMENDOUS apology. Kiera Cass is the mother-effing ORACLE OF DELPHI. GET THAT WOMAN A JOB IN THE WHITE HOUSE, STAT.Because you guys. She predicted Donald Trump's America. Rich businessman. War with China. Renaming country after own self. Creating a caste system based off of how much money one has. I didn't believe this was an America that could happen, but turns out, I was the one who was wrong. *sobbing quietly into nuclear bunker*ORIGINAL REVIEWI almost never write reviews, but I had to write one to try to persuade people to read this book. Really, it has to be read to be believed. This is actually the worst book I've ever had the pleasure to encounter in my life, and I think it's only fair that everyone else get to enjoy it, too. It's the best ten bucks and three hours of my life I've ever spent. I'm not being sarcastic. The entertainment value of this novel is high. Especially if you can reenact scenes out loud with your boyfriend, which I may or may not have done.As for all you people who couldn't finish it? WEAK. Seriously. The effery gets more and more amazing and you missed some inspiring prose. I've read through many of the reviews here, and people have done a good job of covering the problems. Forgive me for treading familiar ground. 1. RIDICULOUS NAMES. I know, Collins did the same thing. But while it works in Hunger Games to underscore the absurdity of the society (the silliest names come from the Capitol or Career districts), here, it just makes all of our descendants sound stupid. Stop smoking pot, kids. Your progeny will be born dumb and name THEIR progeny things like ""America,"" ""Aspen,"" and ""Clarkson."" Please. Think of the children. (Tangent: I was describing this book to a friend, and I said, ""The heroine is named America Singer. She has a really special talent, and you can tell from her name."" My friend: "". . .Is she really good at freedom?"")2. EXECRABLE WORLDBUILDING. Great, even good dystopians SHOULD stem from a plausible scenario of the future (e.g. 1984), and MUST make a commentary on society as it is now (Hunger Games is once again the good example here--it isn't exactly plausible, but all that War is Hell stuff is good). This book fails miserably on both points. Not only is the vision of the future ridiculous and implausible based on the world we know today, it demonstrates a complete lack of historical, economic, political, and anthropological understanding. Midway through the book, we are given a breathtakingly idiotic vision of the future (how has no one addressed this yet? It's like the best part of the book). Apparently, America becomes so indebted to China that China decides to INVADE. No, really. Because if one country is in debt to another and the first country wants its money back, that's what you do! International Relations 101!Only they find out that oops, there IS NO MONEY. Like...the Chinese are sitting there thinking, ""IF ONLY WE INVADE, WE CAN GET OUR MONEY BACK""? Question: WHY DIDN'T AMERICA USE ITS MASSIVE NUCLEAR ARSENAL TO DEFEND ITSELF? Did China defy international conventions and violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it signed in 1992 WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING? Did America somehow lose its stockpile? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? If you're not going to keep things vague like Collins, you need to address the GIANT GAPING HOLES in your idea. SO then America becomes the American State of China (HAHAHAH OMFG) and they get...labor! Yeah! The Chinese want American labor! Anyway, after China invades America, the Russians attack. Because they are SMRT and expanding on BOTH FRONTS (Which two fronts? East and . . . up? I think she might mean China, but it's hard to tell). Only, like Napoleon and Hitler learned (WHEN WILL DICTATORS EVER GET IT RIGHT), fighting a war on two fronts is a BAD IDEA. Russia and China have at it, then a dude named Gregory Illea saves America and forms a new government and country NAMED AFTER HIMSELF.Yes. The nation that didn't even name itself after George Washington, decided to name itself after a ""private citizen who donated his money and knowledge."" (Also, in the history of the world, how many countries are named after a PERSON? Not even the worst dictators in the history of the world have done that.) (ETA. Regarding the naming-a-country-after-a-person, I might be wrong. Not sure. See comments.) I suspect that the attitude of this author is best summed up in what one of the instructors says to the Selected: ""Dear girls, history isn't something you study. It's something you should just know."" If Cass had actually studied history at any point, she would have realized how asinine and ill-concieved this vision of the future is.Moving on, though I guess it's hard to move on from that idiocy. Anyway, the book also doesn't make a particularly cogent argument against misogyny, class-ism, or even basic stupidity. For example, the palace is constantly under attack from rebels. I fail to see why the king doesn't DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Nope. The rebels just keep on breaking in. The king's response? Get some metal window shades. Seriously. He could build an actual fort (which, you know, people managed to do thousands of years ago before they had like tractors and shit). He could move to a secret bunker. He could DIG A MOAT AND FILL IT WITH ALLIGATORS. But no. He got some metal window shades. He deserves to die and this country deserves to fall, just because of the principle of evolution and survival of the fittest. These people ain't it. Finally, the book actually perpetrates and supports misogynistic ideas. For example, Marlee tells America that girls are all bitchy and out to backstab each other. America takes this in stride, instead of, oh, pointing out that her sisters were great to her? Why is it okay to say this or perpetrate this kind of belief about women? Of course it's true of some women, as it's true of some men. But it's not GENERALLY true of ALL women, and to say so is grossly misogynistic. 3. TERRIBLE CHARACTERIZATION. People lack depth, subtlety, and consistency in this book. You have the classic Bitchy Mean Girl, the Devoted Maids, the Kindly Best Friend, the Adorable Young Tyke, and on and on and on. As for lack of consistency: Maxon, for example, is described as being not very good with girls (""I don't meet very many women,"" he says at one point). . . and yet he goes around calling everyone 'my dear' (ewww sleazy, by the way?) like a dedicated Regency rake. It would be one thing if this was described as being awkward, but instead the women all seem to really like it--so he's inexperienced, yet smooth with the ladies? WTF?Maxon is in general the least sexy 'hero' I've ever read. First off, he's a shitty prince. Even America studied the names/faces of the other Selected, but Maxon asks to be ""[forgiven] if [he's] slow with names; there are quite a few [girls]."" You're a PRINCE, Maxon. Learning people's names and remembering them is a PART OF YOUR JOB, especially because you have access to that information. Sit your ass down. Memorize their names and faces. He's also completely ignorant of what's going on in his country until America tells him (and then he becomes an overnight communist because of her. Not that there's anything wrong with communists per se, but I'm still amused). I get that as the prince he was maybe really sheltered from the realities of the caste system, but it's still really unsexy that he hasn't even tried to find out before. It demonstrates a complete lack of curiosity, empathy, and imagination. As a love interest, Maxon is just really creepy. He says, ""You [the Selected girls] are all dear to me. It is simply a matter of discovering who shall be the dearest."" Oh, ick. The problem isn't that Maxon has clearly never been laid, which is fine (I love non-man-ho heroes!), the problem is he's so awkward/sketchy that he also couldn't get laid if his life depended on it. Actually, I wonder if he actually has all his manly parts intact, because he talks/acts/thinks like a not very bright woman. I also really enjoyed this description of Maxon: ""He just looked . . . thoughtful. It was an interesting expression on his face."" Because, you know, Maxon usually just looks dumb as a brick, so when he's thinking, it's totally weird. As for America, her stupidity is kind of endearing. Watching her navigate the world is like watching a toddler cross traffic, only really hilarious. She's unbelievably self-centered, egotistical, and smug. For example, her treatment of her maids is poorly thought out. It's like Cass wants to make America sympathetic by having her care about her maids (such as her concern for the girls during the two rebel attacks), but America's actual behavior towards the girls is condescending and smug. First, she can't be bothered to learn their names/distinguish them from each other. Later, she self-righteously says that she ""enjoys the company of Sixes."" How about saying that YOU NEVER NOTICE CASTES, AMERICA? That would be a better way of putting it. Finally, America seems to think that the girls are TOTALLY HAPPY to just be America's maids and have no outside interests/lives. According to America, they just LIVE to serve her. All people have their own agendas, Cass, and to describe the girls otherwise--especially when you are using them to make a point about America's kindness/thoughtfulness--ends up making America look even more self-absorbed, naive, and oblivious.4. WORSE DIALOGUE. There is no subtlety, no tension. If someone wants to know something? SURE. Any character will spill the inner workings of their mind immediately. Case in point: when Aspen is angry at America for cooking dinner, instead of drawing out the tension and creating a sense of unease with Aspen withholding this information, Aspen simply bursts out the (chauvinistic) truth. Or when Maxon asks America whether or not she can love him (the second time they meet), instead of saying, ""no, you're really creepy/desperate, ew"" or ""how the fuck should I know, I just met you last night,"" which is I think how most girls would respond to that kind of question on the second meeting (NOT even the second date), America says no and then TELLS HIM WHY--a reason that can technically GET HER IN TROUBLE. Who does that? Someone who is acting according to the dictates of plot instead of human nature and their own characterization.(Then another character describes America as 'mysterious' at one point. America, who literally cannot keep her mouth shut about ANYTHING, even her own darkest secrets. Clearly, the author's definition of 'mysterious' is very different from everyone else's.)Cass is also VERY fond of using the dialogue tag ""sing"" or ""sang out."" Of the 7 or 8 times she does this, it fits ONCE (when May sings the ""sitting in a tree"" song.) This is a really idiotic move because I sort of imagine everyone singing in a Miss Piggy tone of voice. 5. PECULIAR DICTION. The queen is described as sitting ""not in an icy way,"" in contrast to her husband and son. Which makes zero sense. Posture is not described as icy: tone is, mien is, but not THE WAY YOU SIT. You can't just use words because you feel like it. Words mean specific things. Also, someone twirls her fork ""menacingly."" No, really. This is one of those fun things you can try to do at dinner tonight. (I get what Cass is trying to go here, but she hasn't described it right. The girl's expression can be menacing WHILE she twirls her fork. Or it can even be something like, ""She was merely twirling pasta on her fork, but she somehow managed to make the gesture look menacing, like she meant to stab me in the eye with it after I was finished eating."" But the way it's written is just abuse of the English language.)America also puts her books on a ""helpful"" shelf. That's how I describe all my furniture when they fulfill their function: chairs are ""helpful"" when I sit in them, beds are ""helpful"" because I can sleep in them, and ""stoves"" are helpful when they HELP ME COOK DINNER. THANKS, STOVE. At one point, America describes Aspen's hair as ""scraggly."" Here is the definition of scraggly:1. (of a person or animal) Thin and bony.2. Ragged, thin, or untidy in form or appearance.Now, I recognize the use of the word ""or"" in this definition: that it can mean ragged, thin, OR untidy. However, words have connotations as well as denotations, and using the word ""scraggly"" implies dirty and thin.Probably not how you want people to imagine one of the love interests' hair. Cass also likes to juxtapose words weirdly, like when America ""whisper-yelled"" at Aspen, or when Maxon laughs ""with a bizarre mix of rigidity and calm,"" or a character who smiles in a way that's both ""excited and timid.""....eh?6. TELLING, NOT SHOWING. America's family is described as poor because they are lower caste. I don't buy it. She has her own bedroom, and her family owns not only a fridge, but a TV, and they eat popcorn while they watch it. Sure, they are kind of hungry (and they don't have enough makeup *tear*), but when they ARE described as having amenities, it isn't explained. And it would have been so easy to do! Such as, ""the fridge was a cast-off from the home of a Three!"" ""Popcorn is cheap, so it's the only snack we can afford!"" ""I had my own room, but only because older sis moved out!"" (It's also unclear what kind of house/neighborhood the Singers live in. Suburbs? Inner city? Rural countryside? This would have gone a long way towards establishing America's poverty).Or people are described as ""regal"" without any indication of what that means (stiff posture? Raised chin? Expressionless face? Walks with a stick up their rears? WHAT? TELL US.) America's first breakfast in the palace: ""The eggs and bacon were heaven, and the pancakes were perfectly done, not too thin like the ones I made at home."" WHAT DO HEAVENLY EGGS AND BACON TASTE LIKE TO YOU, AMERICA? CRISPY? SOGGY? SALTY? DOES THE FAT MELT ON YOUR TONGUE? Writers: make your words count. Here's another stunning example of Cass's descriptive prowess: ""The wallpaper, the gilt mirrors, the giant vases of fresh flowers were all so beautiful. The carpets were lavish and immaculate, the windows were sparkling, and the paintings on the wall were lovely.""What kind of wallpaper is it? How big are the mirrors? What kind of flowers? What do the carpets look like? WHAT DOES ANYTHING LOOK LIKE?This is not how you write description, guys.The telling, not showing also ties into the bad characterization. We are TOLD, for example, that Aspen's mother is kind, because she ""give[s] clothes that didn't fit her kids anymore to families who had next to nothing.""This is not an effective example of kindness. Giving away clothes that you don't use anymore isn't kind, because it lacks the element of sacrifice. It's vaguely charitable at best. If Cass wanted to use this example, she would have had to add something along the lines of ""instead of selling it for money.""7. AWKWARD, STUPID, STILTED PLOT. Witness the 'bargain' that America offers the prince during their first meeting: she offers to be his friend and to help him selected a bride(after spilling all her dark secrets, natch). Then, after like two meetings (dates lol), America is hurt when Maxon didn't tell her something because she thinks that they are 'friends'. Not everyone is you, America. Not everyone tells all their secrets to their actual friends after YEARS, let alone to random people after a mere days. 8. PROBLEMATIC NOTIONS OF LOVE. For example, at one point the prince says, ""I hope to find happiness, too. To find a woman that all of Illea can love, someone to be my companion and to help entertain the leaders of other nations. Someone who will befriend my friends and be my confidante. I'm ready to find my wife.""This is really offensive, and it's never addressed. Maxon's idea of love is incredibly self-centered: someone whom HIS people can love, someone to be HIS companion, someone to help HIM entertain leaders of other nations, someone to befriend HIS friends and be HIS confidante. And sure, a princess is public commodity and she should be popular with his people and not embarrass the country in front of other nations. But even if you strip away the ""public"" aspect, Maxon doesn't at all mention wanting to be friends with HER friends, to be HER support, to be HER companion, to be a part of HER life. He wants to enfold her into HIS life. 9. STATISTICS IS FOR OTHER PEOPLE. I'm a little confused by everyone's lack of understanding of basic statistics in this book. The selection is a lottery, and your odds are Not Good. And yet this book opens, ""When we got the letter in the post, my mother was ecstatic. She had already decided that all our problems were solved, gone forever. The big hitch in her brilliant plan was me.""Um, I hate to break it to you, America, but technically the first big hitch in her problem is STATISTICS. Your problems are not solved until YOU ARE SELECTED. God, if the woman thinks the ""big hitch in her plan"" is America's stubbornness, she must be dumber than a brick--like mother, like daughter, eh? Curse you, mathematics, for being SO DIFFICULTS. Later on, America notes that ""families had already started throwing parties for their daughters, sure that they would be the one chosen for the Selection."" SERIOUSLY? THAT'S LIKE ME CELEBRATING WINNING THE MEGA MILLIONS JACKPOT BECAUSE I BOUGHT A TICKET. 10. FORGET ABOUT THAT MFA. I would say this is pretty much a master class in how not to write a novel. Aspiring novelists, take note. You can learn more about what not to do spending ten bucks on this than in an expensive university writing program11. AUTHORS BEHAVING BADLY. Writing a book is really hard. I respect that. I don't respect the way this author treats reviewers, because reviews are for readers, who deserve to know what they are getting for their money. Edited: You guys, thank you so much for reading. I am blown away by all of your support. The review for The Elite is up, and I'm working on The Heir. Will attach links soon.",1.0
419,New Moon,"I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.",3.59,"['September', '6,', '2006']","Stephen King once said, ""Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good."" I couldn't agree more, Stephen. With that, we shall kick this off with a joke:

Heh. This re-reading is brought to you courtesy of Project: Hindsight. 

I'm sorry folks. I just could not get through this shit book another time. However, since I've already read it a few times, I feel extremely confident in skipping to the review. But first, can someone please explain to me why this book is 563 pages?! Seriously, how is it possible a book with almost no plot can be so long? When I first read New Moon back in 2008, I didn't like it. In fact I'm not even sure why it had three stars because I remember being super frustrated. Even though Edward and Bella's relationship deeply disturbs my soul, Bella is so incredibly boring without him. I'm not even sure how Stephenie Meyer managed 563 pages. Truly, I'm amazed because I can sum up New Moon in one big picture:

But let's get on with it, I'll go into some detail for ya.The book starts off on Bella's 18th birthday, a day she has been dreading for months only because in her mind she will be one year older than Edward. So, she makes a huge production about people not celebrating her birthday, but the Cullens ignore her and Alice plans a party. Before Edward forces her to attend they watch Romeo and Juliet (the book's supposed theme) and they have merry little conversation about Edward's contingency plans once Bella dies. Now, let's not forget they've only been dating for a few months. Yet, here they are making out and talking about killing themselves in the event of the other's death. How romantic. Don't even ask me the logic behind how they can even kiss when his teeth are supposed to be ""venom coated."" Stephenie Meyer gives some bull shit excuse she must have learned from ass-grab 101. But I digress...Finally, they make it to the birthday party. Bella gets a paper cut and Jasper almost single-handedly ends this series on page 29.

 Unfortunately, to my dismay his attempt was foiled by Edward. Eddie pushes Bella out the way and she crashes into the glass plates, slashing up her arm. Pause, let's think about that scene a bit: Who's bright idea was it to have glass plates? With a human. In a room full of vampires. That drink blood. Isn't Alice psychic? Why didn't she see Bella cutting her finger on the wrapping paper? Wait, don't think about that because if you spend all your time contemplating the stupidity, we'll never get through this review.Obviously, Eddie is not happy with the events that went down at his place and Bella further irritates him by apologizing for...wait for it...being human. Bella, you know you've been hanging out with mythical creatures too much when you start thinking your humanity isn't normal. But anyway, Eddie does what any loving boyfriend would do after their girlfriend is attack by their brother: he ignores her. And because Eddie is ""Alpha Male Edward"" and Bella is ""Submissive Mary Sue Bella,"" she doesn't confront him about it. Instead, she waits for him to be ready. On the third day of ignoring her, he drags he into the words and chucks up the deuces. The exchange goes a little like this:

Alpha Male Edward tells Submissive Mary Sue Bella firmly, ""No, I don't want you to come. You're no good for me."" And she pretty much agrees realizing how much of a waste of space she is. Then Edward just pours salt all over her open wound and tells her: 
""Don't do anything reckless or stupid,"" he ordered, no longer detached. ""Do you understand what I'm saying?...I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself--for him.""I nodded helplessly.
 Wow. Relly? You're just going to let him order you around like that? How about you look after yourself FOR YOU first, everyone else second? Awesome Bells. Can I call you Bells? Not only do you have ZERO self-preservation skills, but also no self-confidence. Just awesome. There's only about a million or so girls looking up to you as a role model. No pressure to be a strong female character. You could have walked away from this with grace, but no, instead all your dignity flies out the window when you pull a bitch move and run after Edward through the woods.

Then, she defaults back to ""Fuck my life"" mode and slips into a depression for four fucking months. I find it kind of funny her depression was longer than their actual relationship. Heh. But this wasn't just any depression, it was some serious shit. 
I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it.
 Or how about this: 
Even my outsides looked different--my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that--if I were beautiful and seen from a distance--I might even pass for a vampire now.
 Once again I find myself asking the question: Where are her parents?! Why did Charlie let this go on for FOUR months?! She should have been in counseling or something. But Meyer thinks she can just pacify readers by Renee sending a random e-mail here and there or Charlie just suggesting she seek help, only to be shot down by Bella. Fail. So much fail. All that considered, that's not even the biggest problem I have with this book. Bella soon figures out she can conjure up hallucinations of Edward if she does something reckless or suicidal. This is where Jake comes into play. Bella uses Jake (like everyone else) to get what she wants by asking him to fix up two motorcycles she found and giving her riding lessons. She figures it will be the perfect thing to help her see more of Edward. I suppose she simply forgot how big of a klutz she is and once the bikes are fixed the lessons commence. The first time she gets on she falls off and Jake (the only one with common sense) thinks they should call it a day before she gets hurt. But Bella thinks this is BK and she can have it her way, and gets back on the bike. 





Chick has gone batshit crazy and she promptly busts her ass. But she doesn't care because her mission was a success! She got to see and hear Edward! Her next brilliant idea is to throw herself off a cliff during high tide. The first time I read this I was secretly hoping she would drown, but the other two books already were published, so it was a hopeless wish. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the actual plot. LOL. Funny how that happens when there isn't one, huh? LOL. The She-vamp, Victoria, is scoping out the area trying to get to Bella. But her part is VERY small in this book (like the plot), so we don't really need to talk about her. I suppose the wolf pack is worth mentioning: They're pretty much a bunch of wannabe werewolves that run around with their shirts off. 



That's all you really need to know about them. So, finally Alice shows up in chapter 18 because she thought Bella was trying to commit suicide (close enough Alice). And through a nice little exchange of ""he said, she said"" BS, Edward is off to Italy to kill himself. This causes Bella to go into ""hero"" mode and race to Italy and save Edward. I really don't care enough to give my thoughts on the race to Italy. That entire part was rushed and anti-climatic. There isn't even a fight scene. Instead here is a timeline courtesy of Reasoning with Vampires (Thanks for the link Cait and Jen!):

Anyway, they get back to good old Forks and Bella composes a vote on everyone's thoughts of her joining team undead. Edward is at a steady ""no"" along with Rosalie. But everyone else says, ""Hell yes!"" Like becoming a vampire is a party or something. Funny thing is when Bella asks Jasper he goes:

And she's all:

Hmm, yeah, that's not weird at all. Not the least bit creepy.In the last few pages Edward and Jake have a little pissing contest and Edward proposes to Bella. The End. Yawn. Thank God it's over. Now where's my fuckin' chocolate?My Twilight Review can be found here.***BONUS***Oh, yeah, bonus time. 'Cause what's a review without one?Quick! If I were to light Edward on fire what would he become?
